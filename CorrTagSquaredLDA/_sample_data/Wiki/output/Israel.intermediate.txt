In 1948, the country was formally named ''Medinat Yisrael'', or the State of Israel, referring to the ancient [[Israelites]] of the region, after other proposed historical and religious names including ''Eretz Israel'' ("the [[Land of Israel]]"), [[Zion]], and [[Judea]], were considered and rejected.<ref>{{citation

Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years, but unstable coalitions or a [[motion of no confidence|no-confidence vote]] by the Knesset often dissolves governments earlier. "The average life span of an Israeli government is 22 months. The peace process, the role of religion in the state, and political scandals have caused coalitions to break apart or produced early elections."<ref>{{Citation |url=http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/RL33476.pdf |title=Israel: Background and Relations with the United States |format=PDF |publisher=Congressional Research Service (via the U.S. Mission to Italy) |last=Migdalovitz |first=Carol |date=6 July 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2009 |page=23}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

{{Main|Israeli judicial system}}

[[File:Elyon.JPG|thumb|The Israeli Supreme Court, [[Givat Ram]], Jerusalem.]]
Israel has a [[Israeli judicial system|three-tier court system]]. At the lowest level are [[magistrate]] courts, situated in most cities across the country. Above them are [[district court]]s, serving both as [[appeal|appellate]] courts and [[trial court|courts of first instance]]; they are situated in five of Israel's six [[Districts of Israel|districts]]. The third and highest tier in Israel is the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], seated in Jerusalem. It serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the [[Supreme Court of Israel#High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice]]. In the latter role, the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, allowing individuals, both citizens and non-citizens, to petition against decisions of state authorities.<ref name="judiciary">{{Citation |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Branches%20of%20Government/Judicial/The%20Judiciary-%20The%20Court%20System |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 August 2007 |date=1 August 2005 |title=The Judiciary: The Court System}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/editorial/view.bg?articleid=1030205 |publisher=The Boston Herald |title=Israel’s high court unique in region |accessdate=15 September 2007 |date=9 September 2007}}</ref> Although Israel supports the goals of the [[International Criminal Court]], it has not ratified the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality.<ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/6/Israel%20and%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court| title=Israel and the International Criminal Court| publisher=Office of the Legal Adviser to the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2007}}</ref>

In addition to the three-tier court system described above (also known as the "General Court system") Israel has also a system of specialized Labour Courts, similar to those found in Continental Europe. The Labour Courts have unique jurisdiction over labour matters (both on the individual and collective spheres) as well as social welfare matters (e.g. law suits related to pensions, social security benefits, healthcare, etc.). Each one of the five judicial districts has one Regional Labour Court which serves as a first instance court for those matters described above.

Most matters in Labour Courts are adjudicated by a three-panel consisting of one professional judge, and two lay representatives nominated to the court with the consent of the largest employees and employers unions (one representative termed as "Employees Representative" and the other as "Employers Representative"). Some matters (e.g. criminal cases related to labour law) are adjudicated by a professional judge only. The National Labour Court, situated in Jerusalem, serves as an appeal court as well as a first-instance court for matters with national importance (e.g. collective bargaining disputes, on a national level, between employees and employers unions).

Israel's legal system combines [[English law|English]] [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[Halakha|Jewish law]].<ref name="cia" /> It is based on the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (precedent) and is an [[adversarial system]], where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court. Court cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries.<ref name="judiciary" /> [[Marriage]] and [[divorce]] are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts: [[Beth din|Jewish]], [[Sharia|Muslim]], Druze, and Christian. A committee of Knesset members, Supreme Court justices, and Israeli Bar members carries out the election of judges.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/State/THE+STATE-+Judiciary-+The+Court+System.htm |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=9 August 2007 |date=1 October 2006 |title=The State&nbsp;— Judiciary&nbsp;— The Court System}}</ref>
Administration of Israel's courts (both the "General" courts and the Labor Courts) is carried by the Administration of Courts, situated in Jerusalem. It is to be noted that both the General and Labor courts are paperless courts, i.e. storage of court files, as well as court decisions, are carried out electronically.

Israel's [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty]] seeks to defend [[Human rights in Israel|human rights and liberties in Israel]]. Israel is the only country in the region ranked "Free" by [[Freedom House]] based on the level of civil liberties and political rights; the "Israeli Occupied Territories/Palestinian Authority" was ranked "Not Free."<ref>{{Citation |title=Freedom in the World 2008 – Israel |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2008&country=7416

{{Main|Israeli-occupied territories}}

In 1967, as a result of the [[Six-Day War]], Israel gained control of the [[West Bank]], [[East Jerusalem]], the [[Gaza Strip|Gaza strip]] and the [[Golan Heights]]. Israel also took control of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]].

[[File:Is-wb-gs-gh v3.png|thumb|left|Map of Israel showing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights]]
Following Israel's capture of these territories, [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] consisting of Israeli citizens were established within each of them. Israel has applied civilian law to the [[Golan Heights Law|Golan Heights]] and [[Jerusalem Law|East Jerusalem]], incorporating them into its territory and offering their inhabitants permanent residency status and the possibility to become full citizen if they asked it. In contrast, the West Bank has remained under military occupation, and it and the [[Gaza Strip]] are seen by the Palestinians and most of the international community as the site of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Solana: EU aims to establish a Palestinian state at the earliest possible moment within the 1967 borders. |first=Adar |last=Primor |newspaper=Haaretz |date=24 October 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1123034.html}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/11/132434.htm |title=United States: "an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps" |author= |date=25 November 2009 |work= |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> The UN Security Council has declared the incorporation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be "null and void" and continues to view the territories as occupied.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/418/84/IMG/NR041884.pdf?OpenElement |title=Golan Heights: UNSC Res. 497 |author= |year=1981 |work= |publisher=UN |accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/dde590c6ff232007852560df0065fddb?OpenDocument |title=East Jerusalem: UNSC Res. 478 |author= |year=1980 |work= |publisher=UN |accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref>
The [[International Court of Justice]], principal judicial organ of the United Nations, determined in its [[International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict#Ruling of the ICJ|2004 advisory opinion]] on the legality of the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory.<ref>{{Citation |title=Arabs will ask UN to seek razing of Israeli wall | publisher=[[msnbc.com]] |date=9 July 2004 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5400559/ |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref>

The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult hurdle in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians. Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]], which emphasises " the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war", and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states, a principle known as "[[Land for peace]]".<ref>{{Citation |title=Olmert: Willing to trade land for peace |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date =16 December 2006 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3340641,00.html |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Syria ready to discuss land for peace |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=12 June 2007 |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181570258086&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071121060510/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181570258086&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archivedate=21 November 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Egypt: Israel must accept the land-for-peace formula |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=15 May 2007 |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1173879095966 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080501231415/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1173879095966 |archivedate=1 May 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref>

The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1948, following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine.

The [[Gaza Strip]] was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967]] and then by Israel after 1967. In 2005, as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]], Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory. Israel does not consider the Gaza Strip to be occupied territory and declared it a "foreign territory".

Israel has two official languages, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name="cia" /> Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken by the majority of the population, and Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority.

[[Israeli literature]] is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew, as part of the renaissance of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as a spoken language since the mid-19th century, although a small body of literature is published in other languages, such as English. By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://jnul.huji.ac.il/eng/lgd.html |publisher=Jewish National and University Library |title=Depositing Books to The Jewish National & University Library |accessdate=21 August 2007}}</ref> In 2006, 85&nbsp;percent of the 8,000 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://jnul.huji.ac.il/eng/lgd-statistics-2007.html |publisher=Jewish National and University Library |accessdate=12 August 2007 |title=Israeli Book Statistics for 2006}}</ref>

The [[Hebrew Book Week]] ([[Hebrew language|He:]] {{Hebrew|שבוע הספר}}) is held each June and features book fairs, public readings, and appearances by Israeli authors around the country. During the week, Israel's top literary award, the [[Sapir Prize]], is presented.

In 1966, [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] with German Jewish author [[Nelly Sachs]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1966/index.html |publisher=Nobel Foundation |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1966 |accessdate=12 August 2007}}</ref>

Israel has also been the home of two leading Palestinian poets and writers: [[Emile Habibi]], whose novel ''The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist'', and other writings, won him the Israel prize for Arabic literature; and [[Mahmoud Darwish]], considered by many to be "the Palestinian national poet."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7551918.stm BBC News] 9 August 2008 ''Palestinian 'national poet' dies''</ref> Darwish was born and raised in northern Israel, but lived his adult life in exile after joining the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].

Modern dance in Israel is a flourishing field, and several Israeli choreographers such as [[Ohad Naharin]], Rami Beer, [[Barak Marshall]] and many others, are considered to be among the most versatile and original international creators working today. Famous Israeli companies include the [[Batsheva Dance Company]] and the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company.

Israel is home to many Palestinian musicians, including internationally acclaimed [[oud]] and violin virtuoso Taiseer Elias, singer [[Amal Murkus]], and brothers Samir and Wissam [[Wissam Joubran|Joubran]].  Israeli Arab musicians have achieved fame beyond Israel's borders: Elias and Murkus frequently play to audiences in Europe and America, and oud player Darwish Darwish (Prof. Elias's student) was awarded first prize in the all-Arab oud contest in Egypt in 2003. The [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance]] has an advanced degree program, headed by Taiseer Elias, in Arabic music.

Palestinian Israeli filmmakers have made a number of films, some of them very controversial, dealing with the Arab-Israel conflict and the status of Palestinians within Israel. [[Mohammed Bakri]]'s 2002 film [[Jenin, Jenin]], about an Israeli military action in the West Bank town of Jenin, won the Best Film award at the Carthage International film festival, but was widely criticized within Israel for distorting the story of the battle. [[Ajami]], a 2009 film about violence and discrimination in a mixed Jewish-Arab neighborhood in south Tel Aviv-Jaffa, was written and directed jointly by Palestinain Scandar Copti and Jewish Israeli Yaron Shani. It won an honorable mention in the Cannes Film Festival. [[The Syrian Bride]], about a Druze wedding between families on opposite sides of the Israel-Syrian ceasefire line in the Golan Heights, was directed by a Jewish Israeli (Eran Riklis), but had an almost completely Druze cast.

{{Main|Israeli cuisine}}

Israeli [[cuisine]] comprises local dishes and [[Immigrant cuisine|dishes brought to the country]] by Jewish immigrants from around the world. Since the establishment of the State in 1948, and particularly since the late 1970s, an Israeli [[fusion cuisine]] has developed.

Israeli cuisine has adopted, and continues to adapt, elements of various styles of the [[Jewish cuisine]], particularly the [[Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]], [[Cuisine of the Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]], and [[Ashkenazi cuisine|Ashkenazi]] styles of cooking, along with [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jewish]], [[Iraqi Jews|Iraqi Jewish]], [[Ethiopian Jewish]], [[Indian Jewish]], [[Iranian Jews|Iranian Jewish]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemeni Jewish]] influences. It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in the [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine]]s, as [[falafel]], [[hummus]], [[shakshouka]], [[couscous]], and [[za'atar]] have become essential dishes in Israel.

|{{note|capital-disp}}The [[Jerusalem Law]] states that "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel" and the city serves as the seat of the government, home to the President's residence, government offices, supreme court, and [[Knesset|parliament]]. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] (Aug. 20, 1980; 14–0, U.S. abstaining) declared the Jerusalem Law "null and void" and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem. The [[United Nations]] and all member nations refuse to accept the Jerusalem Law (see {{harvnb|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}) and maintain their embassies in other cities such as Tel Aviv, [[Ramat Gan]], and [[Herzliya]]<small> (see the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html CIA Factbook] and [http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf Map of Israel])</small>. The U.S. Congress subsequently adopted the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which said that the U.S. embassy should be relocated to Jerusalem and that it should be recognized as the capital of Israel. However, the US Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the act "invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional". Since passage of the act, all Presidents serving in office have determined that moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. The [[Palestinian Authority]] sees [[East Jerusalem]] as the capital of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]]. The city's final status awaits future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (see [http://web.archive.org/web/20060514191731/http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/IPPP/Fall97Report/negotiating_jerusalem.htm "Negotiating Jerusalem", University of Maryland]). See [[Positions on Jerusalem]] for more information.
