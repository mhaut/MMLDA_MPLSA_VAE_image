{{Main|History of Korea}}
[[Image:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jikji]]'', the first known book printed with movable metal type in 1377. Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris.]]
Korean history begins with the founding of Jo-seon (often known as "[[Gojoseon]]" to prevent confusion with another dynasty founded in the 14th century; the prefix Go- means 'old' or 'earlier') in 2333&nbsp;BC by [[Dangun]], according to Korean foundation mythology.<ref name=koreashistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|title=Korea's History|publisher=Asian Shravan|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> Gojoseon expanded until it controlled northern Korean Peninsula and some parts of [[Manchuria]]. After many conflicts with the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]], Gojoseon disintegrated, leading to the [[Proto-Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period.

In the early centuries of the Common Era, [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]], and the [[Samhan]] confederacy occupied the peninsula and southern Manchuria. Of the various small states, [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]] grew to control the peninsula as [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. The unification of the Three Kingdoms by [[Unified Silla|Silla]] in 676 led to the [[North South States Period]], in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by [[Unified Silla]], while [[Balhae]] succeeded the northern parts of Goguryeo. In [[Unified Silla]], poetry and art was encouraged, and Buddhist culture thrived. Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. However, Unified Silla weakened under internal strife, and surrendered to [[Goryeo]] in 935. [[Balhae]], Silla's neighbor to the north, was formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of Russia. It fell to the [[History of the Khitans|Khitan]] in 926.

[[File:Gyeongbok Palace main attraction.png|thumb|right|[[Gyeongbokgung|Gyeongbok Palace]] is the largest of the [[Five Grand Palaces]] built during the [[Joseon Dynasty]].]]

The peninsula was united by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Emperor Taejo]] of [[Goryeo]] in 936. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state and created the [[Jikji]] in 1377, using the world's oldest movable metal type [[printing press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljikji.net/digital_jikji/main.asp|title=Digital Jikji|publisher=Digital Jikji|date=|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> The [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century greatly weakened Goryeo. After nearly 30 years of war, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols. After the [[Mongolian Empire]] collapsed, severe political strife followed and the Goryeo Dynasty was replaced by the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in 1388 following a rebellion by General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]].

King Taejo declared the new name of Korea as "Joseon" in reference to [[Gojoseon]], and moved the capital to [[Seoul]]. The first 200 years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by relative peace and saw the creation of [[Hangul]] by [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong the Great]] in the 14th century and the rise in influence of [[Confucianism]] in the country.

Between 1592 and 1598, the [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Japanese invaded Korea]]. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] led the forces and tried to invade the Asian continent through Korea, but was eventually repelled by the [[Righteous army]] and assistance from [[Ming Dynasty]] China. This war also saw the rise of Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] and his renowned "[[turtle ship]]". In the 1620s and 1630s, Joseon suffered from [[Manchu invasion of Korea|invasions by the Manchu]] who eventually conquered all of China.

[[File:Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea - February 2009.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Seoul]]'s [[Gangnam-gu|Gangnam]] district today]]

After another series of [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|wars against Manchuria]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]] particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon Dynasty.

However, the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by a dependence on China for external affairs and isolation from the outside world. During the 19th century, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the name the "[[Hermit Kingdom]]". The Joseon Dynasty tried to protect itself against Western [[imperialism]], but was eventually forced to open trade. After the [[Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupied by Japan]] (1910–1945). At the end of World War&nbsp;II, the Japanese surrendered to Soviet and U.S. forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of Korea, respectively.

{{Main|History of South Korea}}
Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 [[Cairo Declaration]], escalating [[Cold War]] antagonism between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States eventually led to the establishment of separate governments, each with its own [[ideology]], leading to [[division of Korea|Korea's division]] into two political entities in 1948: [[North Korea]] and South Korea. In the North, a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, [[Kim Il-sung]] gained power through Soviet support, and in the South, an exiled and right-wing Korean political leader, [[Syngman Rhee]], was installed as president.

[[File:Seoul.Olympic.Stadium.01 copy.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Seoul Olympic Stadium]], seen from the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].]]

On 25 June 1950, [[North Korea]] invaded South Korea, sparking the [[Korean War]], the Cold War's first major conflict. At the time, the [[Soviet Union]] had boycotted the [[United Nations]] (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese troops]]. After huge advances on both sides, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. The 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|demilitarized zone]] near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. At least {{Nowrap|2.5 million}} people died during the Korean War.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322419/Korean-War Korean War (1950–53)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref>

In 1960, [[April Revolution|a student uprising]] (the "4.19 Revolution") led to the resignation of the autocratic President [[Syngman Rhee]]. A period of political instability followed, broken by General [[Park Chung-hee]]'s [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction|military coup]] (the "5.16 ''coup d'état''") against the weak and ineffectual government the next year. Park took over as president until [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979, overseeing rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] as well as severe political repression. Park was heavily criticised as a ruthless military dictator, although the Korean economy developed significantly during his tenure.

The years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously repressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there was [[Coup d'état of December Twelfth]] by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. After the Coup d'état, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power with several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to Jeju-do. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun assumed the presidency by the event of May 17, triggering nationwide protests demanding [[democracy]], in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], where Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], 2000-05-17.</ref>

Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student was tortured to death.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html 20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death], The Hankyoreh, 2007-01-15. Retrieved 2010-07-15.</ref> On {{Nowrap|10 June}}, the [[Catholic Priests Association for Justice]] revealed the incident, igniting huge demonstrations around the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the [[Democratic Justice Party]], and its leader, [[Roh Tae-woo]] announced the June 29th Declaration, which included the direct election of the president. Roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, [[Kim Dae-Jung]] and [[Kim Young-Sam]].

In 1988, Seoul hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. It became a member of the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1996.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_33873108_33873555_1_1_1_1_1,00.html About Korea], OECD</ref> It was adversely affected by the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. However, the country was able to recover and continue its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.

In June 2000, as part of president Kim Dae-Jung's "[[Sunshine Policy]]" of engagement, a [[Inter-Korean Summit|North–South summit]] took place in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of North Korea. Later that year, Kim received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2000/index.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2000|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|year=2000|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref>

In 2002, South Korea and Japan jointly co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], however [[Japan–Korea relations|South Korean and Japanese relations]] later [[Japan–Korea disputes|soured]] due to conflicting claims of [[sovereignty]] over the [[Liancourt Rocks]] (referred to as Dokdo in Korea, and Takeshima in Japan), in what became known as the [[Liancourt Rocks dispute]].

Like many democracies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a330.g.akamai.net/7/330/25828/20081021185552/graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy%20Index%202008.pdf|title=The Economist Intelligence Unit's Index of Democracy 2008|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> South Korea's government is divided into three branches: [[executive (government)|executive]], [[judiciary|judicial]], and [[legislature|legislative]]. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. Local governments are semi-autonomous, and contain executive and [[legislative bodies]] of their own. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. South Korea is a constitutional democracy.

The South Korean government's structure is determined by the [[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]. This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence. However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived [[Second Republic of South Korea]], the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ks00000_.html|title=South Korea - Constitution|publisher=International Constitutional Law|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref> The first direct [[Elections in South Korea|election]] was also held in 1948. Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships since the 1960s up until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful [[liberal democracy]]. Today, the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] describes South Korea's democracy as a "fully functioning modern democracy".<ref name=ciawfb>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ks.html|title=Korea, South|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

{{Main|Foreign relations of South Korea}}
South Korea maintains diplomatic relations with more than 188 countries. The country has also been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. On January 1, 2007, South Korean Foreign Minister [[Ban Ki-moon]] assumed the post of [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]]. It has also developed links with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] as both a member of ''ASEAN Plus three,'' a body of observers, and the [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS).

In 2010, South Korea and the [[European Union]] concluded a [[European Union-Korea Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] (FTA) to reduce trade barriers. South Korea is also negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/korea-coree/index.aspx?lang=en|title=Canada-Korea – Free Trade Agreement Negotiations|publisher=Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada|date=5 January 2009|accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref> and another with [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/03/content_10933684.htm|title=South Korea, New Zealand launch FTA negotiations English Xinhua|publisher=News.xinhuanet.com|date=2009-03-03|accessdate=2010-02-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In November 2009 South Korea joined the OECD [[Development Assistance Committee]], marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member.

{{main|People's Republic of China-South Korea relations|Republic of China-South Korea relations}}
Historically, Korea has had close relations with China. Before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation. However, after [[World War&nbsp;II]], the People's Republic of China embraced [[Maoism]] while South Korea sought close relations with the United States. The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the [[Korean War]], and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually and South Korea and the PRC re-established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992. The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year old trade embargo, and<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FI11Dg03.html |title=Asia Times&nbsp;– News and analysis from Korea; North and South |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2004-09-11 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> South Korean–Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the [[Republic of China]] upon gaining official relations with the People's Republic of China.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/24/world/chinese-and-south-koreans-formally-establish-relations.html NYtimes.com], published 1992-08-24</ref>

The [[European Union]] (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a [[free trade agreement]] for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement has been approved in September 2010, following [[Italy]]'s conditional withdrawal of its veto of the free trade agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hjiU353BrLQrVT2oZEu5HPb40ugA|publisher=AFP|title=EU agrees free trade deal with S.Korea|date=2009-09-16}}</ref> The compromise made by Italy was that free trade agreement would take provisional effect on July 1, 2011. South Korea is the EU's eighth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South Korea's second largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded €65 billion in 2008 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 7.5% between 2004 and 2008.<ref name=EU>{{cite news|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/korea/|publisher=European Commission|title=Bilateral Relations: Korea}}</ref>

The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market due to stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve this situation.<ref name=EU />

The United States engaged in the decolonization of Korea (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea) from Japan after World War&nbsp;II. After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established. Upon the onset of the Korean War, U.S. forces were sent to defend South Korea against invasion by North Korea and later China. Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a "Mutual Defense Treaty", under which an attack on either party in the [[Pacific]] area would summon a response from both.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/kor001.asp|publisher=Yale Law School|title=Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea; October 1, 1953}}</ref> In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[US Eighth Army|U.S. Eighth Army]], [[Seventh Air Force]], and [[Commander Naval Forces Korea|U.S. Naval Forces Korea]] are stationed in South Korea. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=7819663&jid=PSC&volumeId=43&issueId=03&aid=7819661|publisher=Cambridge University Press|title=South Korean Attitudes toward the ROK–U.S. Alliance: Group Analysis|author=Haesook Chae|year=2010}}</ref> In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the [[South Korea – United States Free Trade Agreement|Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (KORUS FTA) was reportedly signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation has been repeatedly delayed, pending further approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.

From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years. South Korea dispatched 325,517 troops to fight alongside American, Australian, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Vietnam]]ese soldiers in the [[Vietnam War]], with a peak strength of 50,000. In 2004, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the [[Zaytun Division]] to help re-building in northern [[Iraq]], and was the third largest contributor in the [[Multinational force in Iraq|coalition forces]] after only the US and Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil.kr:7081/zaytun2/english/index.jsp|title=Zaytun Division official website|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-02-17}}{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}</ref> Beginning in 2001, South Korea had so far deployed 24,000 troops in the Middle East region to support the [[War on Terrorism]].

South Korea occupies the southern portion of the [[Korean Peninsula]], which extends some 680 miles (1,100&nbsp;km) from the Asian mainland. This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the [[Yellow Sea]] to the west, and [[Sea of Japan]] ([[Sea of Japan naming dispute|East Sea]])<!--Please do not change the naming here without first discussing it at the Talk page.--> to the east. Its southern tip lies on the [[Korea Strait]] and the [[East China Sea]].

The country, including all its islands, lies between latitudes [[33rd parallel north|33°]] and [[39th parallel north|39°N]], and longitudes [[124th meridian east|124°]] and [[130th meridian east|130°E]]. Its total area is {{convert|38622.57|sqmi|km2|2}}.<ref>The estimated area rises steadily from year to year, possibly due to land reclamation. {{cite web|url=http://kosis.nso.go.kr/cgi-bin/sws_999.cgi?ID=DT_1A1&IDTYPE=3&A_LANG=1&FPUB=3&SELITEM=|work=Korea Statistical Information Service|title=행정구역(구시군)별 국토적|accessdate=2006-03-27}}</ref>

South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow [[coastal plains]]; a western region of broad coastal plains, [[drainage basin|river basins]], and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the [[Nakdong River]].<ref name="korea geo">[http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/geography.htm#LAND Geography of Korea], Asia Info Organization</ref>

South Korea's terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not [[arable land|arable]]. [[Lowland]]s, located primarily in the west and southeast, make up only 30% of the total land area.

About three thousand islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea. [[Jeju-do]] is located about 100 kilometers (about 60&nbsp;mi) off the southern coast of South Korea. It is the country's largest island, with an area of 1,845 square kilometres (712 sq mi). Jeju is also the site of South Korea's highest point: [[Hallasan]], an extinct [[volcano]], reaches 1,950 meters (6,398&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The most eastern islands of South Korea include [[Ulleungdo]] and [[Liancourt Rocks]] (Dokdo), while [[Marado]] and [[Socotra Rock]] are the southernmost islands of South Korea.<ref name="korea geo"/>

South Korea has [[National parks of South Korea|20 national parks]] and popular nature places like the [[Boseong|Boseong Tea Fields]], [[Suncheon Ecological Park|Suncheon Bay Ecological Park]], and the first national park of [[Jirisan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.knps.or.kr/ |title=Korea Nationa Park Service official site |publisher=English.knps.or.kr |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref>

South Korea tends to have a [[humid continental climate]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]], and is affected by the [[East Asian monsoon]], with [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] heavier in summer during a short rainy season called ''[[East Asian rainy season|jangma]]'' ([[:ko:장마|장마]]), which begins end of June through the end of July. Winters can be extremely cold with the minimum temperature dropping below −20&nbsp;°C in the inland region of the country: in Seoul, the average January temperature range is −7&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] to 1&nbsp;°C (19&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 33&nbsp;°F), and the average August temperature range is 22&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C (71&nbsp;°F to 86&nbsp;°F). Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/31.htm South Korea climate], U.S. Library of Congress, Country studies</ref> Summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding 30 °C in most parts of the country.

{{Main|Education in South Korea}}
Education in South Korea is regarded as being crucial to one's success, and competition is consequently very heated and fierce. In the 2006 results of the [[OECD]] [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], South Korea came first in [[problem solving]], third in [[mathematics]] and seventh in [[science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pisa.oecd.org/|title=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|publisher=Pisa.oecd.org|date=|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref> South Korea's education system is technologically advanced and it is the world's first country to bring high-speed [[fibre-optic]] [[broadband]] internet access to every primary and secondary school nation-wide. Using this infrastructure, the country has developed the first [[Digital Textbook]]s in the world, which will be distributed for free to every primary and secondary school nation-wide by 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/cs/korea/material/CS_KOR.pdf|title=Broadband Korea: Internet Case Study|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>

A centralised administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school. South Korea has adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010. According to Ministry of Education, Science and Technology estimate, by that time, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea will be doubled, and the number of foreign students will reach 100,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education-blog.net/2008/08/28/south-korea-now-open-for-foreign-students/|title=South Korea Now Open For Foreign Students|publisher=Education-blog.net|date=2008-08-28|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>
The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins in the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February. The schedules are not uniformly standardized and vary from school to school.
Most South Korean middle schools and high schools have school uniforms, modeled on western-style uniforms. Boys' uniforms usually consists of trousers and white shirts, and girls wear skirts and white shirts.

<text>

{{Main|Demographics of South Korea|Koreans}}
South Korea is noted for its population density, which at 487 per square kilometer is more than 10 times the global average. Most South Koreans live in urban areas, due to rapid migration from the countryside during the country's quick economic expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/33.htm|title=South Korea|work=CIA Country Studies|accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> The capital city of [[Seoul]] is also the country's largest city and chief industrial center. According to the 2005 census, Seoul had a population of {{Nowrap|9.8 million}} inhabitants. The [[Seoul National Capital Area]] has {{Nowrap|24.5 million}} inhabitants making it the world's second largest metropolitan area and easily the most densely populated city in the OECD. Other major cities include [[Busan]] ({{Nowrap|3.5 million}}), [[Incheon]] ({{Nowrap|2.5 million}}), [[Daegu]] ({{Nowrap|2.5 million}}), [[Daejeon]] ({{Nowrap|1.4 million}}), [[Gwangju]] ({{Nowrap|1.4 million}}) and [[Ulsan]] ({{Nowrap|1 million}}).<ref>Populations for all cities as of 2005, {{cite web|url=http://www.kosis.kr/eng/e_stat_OLAP.jsp?tbl_id=DT_1IN0001&org_id=101&vwcd=MT_ETITLE&path=&oper_YN=Y&lang_mode=eng|title=Summary of Census Population (by administrative district/sex/age)|work=NSO Database|accessdate=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The population has also been shaped by international migration. Following the [[Division of Korea|division of the Korean Peninsula]] after World War&nbsp;II, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next forty years due to emigration, especially to the United States and Canada. South Korea's total population in 1960 was {{Nowrap|25 million}}.<ref>[http://esa.un.org/unpp/p2k0data.asp World Population Prospects: The 2006 Revision].

South Korea is ethnically one of the most homogeneous societies in the world with more than 99 per cent of inhabitants having [[Koreans|Korean]] ethnicity.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ks.html#People South Korea].

Although [[life expectancy]] has increased significantly since 1950, South Korea faces a number of important health-care issues. Foremost is the impact of [[environmental pollution]] on an increasingly urbanized population. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, chronic diseases account for the majority of diseases in South Korea, a condition exacerbated by the health care system's focus on treatment rather than prevention. The incidence of chronic disease in South Korea hovers around 24 percent. Approximately 33 percent of all adults [[Smoking|smoke]]. The [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) rate of prevalence at the end of 2003 was less than 0.1 percent.

South Korea shares its traditional culture with [[North Korea]], but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945.

The industrialization and urbanization of South Korea have brought many changes to the way [[Korean people]] live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-generational households separating into [[nuclear family]] living arrangements.

Due to South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.<ref>[http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/arc/modern_period.htm Korean architecture], Asian Info Organization</ref>

Korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. Ancient architects adopted the [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket system]] and is characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called ''[[ondol]]''.<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/03/148_63378.html Exhibit Focuses on Traditional Architecture], Korea Times, 2010-03-31; [http://park.org/Korea/Pavilions/PublicPavilions/KoreaImage/e-information/life/tradi-03.html Photos of traditional Korean shelters]</ref> People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs with lifting eaves.

Western architecture was first introduced to Korea at the end of the 19th century. Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles. With [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910]] the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed. The anti-Japanese sentiment, and the [[Korean War]], led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.<ref>[http://nongae.gsnu.ac.kr/~mirkoh/cob1.html Brief Review of Korea Modern Architecture], Prof. Park Kil-ryong (Kukmin University), modified by Architectural Design Lab, GSNU.</ref>

Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles. Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects.<ref>[http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/arc/contemporary_architecture.htm Contemporary Korean architecture], Asian Info Organization</ref> Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of "harmony with nature" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.<ref>[http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?id=9605&sec=10 Korean buildings that captivate world], Asia News, 2010-01-15; [http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2903625 Still, slow waters of Korean architecture], Joongang Daily, 2009-04-16.

<text>

{{Main|Korean cuisine}}
Korean cuisine, ''hanguk yori'' (한국요리; 韓國料理), or ''hansik'' (한식; 韓食), has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.

Korean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (반찬), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice.  Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]], a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (된장), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (고추장), a hot pepper paste.

Soups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (국) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (탕) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (찌개), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.

In addition to domestic consumption, South Korean mainstream culture, including televised drama, films, and popular music, also generates significant exports to various parts of the world. This phenomenon, often called "[[Hallyu]]" or the "Korean Wave", has swept many countries in Asia and other parts of the world.<ref name=Kwave>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1646903.stm|title='Korean Wave' piracy hits music industry|publisher=bbc.com|date=2001-11-09|accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>

Until the 1990s, [[trot (music)|trot]] and [[ballad]]s dominated Korean popular music. The emergence of the rap group [[Seo Taiji and Boys]] in 1992 marked a turning point for Korean popular music, also known as [[K-Pop]], as the group incorporated elements of popular musical genres of [[rap music|rap]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[techno]] into its music.<ref>[http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/entertainment/enter_artists_detail.htm?No=10058 Seo Taiji], KBS World</ref> Hip hop, dance and ballad oriented acts have become dominant in the Korean popular music scene, though trot is still popular among older Koreans. Many K-Pop stars and groups are also well known abroad, especially in Asia.<!--Do not add a list of groups here without first suggesting it at the Talk page.-->

Since the success of the film ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' in 1999, [[Korean film]] has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly due to the existence of [[screen quotas]] requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.<ref>[http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Ec_detail.htm?No=74142 S.Korea's Screen Quota Hinders Market Access], KBS World, 2010-07-16.</ref>

[[Korean drama|Korean television shows]], especially the short form dramatic mini-series called "dramas", have also become popular outside of Korea, becoming another driving trend for wider recognition. The trend has caused some Korean actors to become better known abroad. The dramas are popular mostly in Asia. The stories have tended to have a romance focus, such as [[You're Beautiful]], [[My Name is Kim Sam Soon]], [[Boys over Flowers]], [[Winter Sonata]], [[Autumn Fairy Tale]], [[Full House (2004 TV series)|Full House]], [[All About Eve (TV series)|All About Eve]]. Historical/fantasy dramas have included [[Dae Jang Geum]], [[The Legend (TV series)|The Legend]], [[Goong]], and [[Sungkyunkwan Scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreandrama.org/ |title=List of Korean dramas |publisher=Koreandrama.org |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref>
