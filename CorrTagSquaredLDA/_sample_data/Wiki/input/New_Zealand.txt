'''New Zealand''' is an [[island country]] in the south-western [[Pacific Ocean]] comprising two main landmasses (the [[North Island]] and the [[South Island]]) and numerous [[Islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]], most notably [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] and the [[Chatham Islands]]. The indigenous [[Māori language|Māori]] name for New Zealand is '''[[Aotearoa]]''', commonly translated as ''land of the long white cloud''. The [[Realm of New Zealand]] also includes [[Tokelau]]; the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (self-governing but in [[Associated state|free association]]); and the [[Ross Dependency]], New Zealand's [[Territorial claims of Antarctica|territorial claim in Antarctica]].

New Zealand is notable for its geographic isolation; it is situated about {{convert|2000|km}} southeast of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]], and its closest neighbours to the north are [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Tonga]]. During its long isolation New Zealand developed a [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|distinctive fauna]] dominated by [[Birds of New Zealand|birds]], a number of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and the [[Invasive species in New Zealand|mammals they introduced]].

The majority of [[New Zealanders|New Zealand's population]] is of [[New Zealand European|European descent]]; the indigenous [[Māori]] are the largest minority. Asians and non-Māori Polynesians are also significant minority groups, especially in [[List of cities in New Zealand|urban areas]]. The most commonly spoken language is English.

New Zealand is a developed country that ranks highly in international comparisons on many topics, including [[Corruption perceptions index|lack of corruption]], [[Education Index|high educational attainment]] and [[Indices of economic freedom|economic freedom]]. The 2010 and 2009 [[Global Peace Index]] surveys ranked New Zealand as the most peaceful country in the world.<ref>[http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/results/rankings/2008/ Global Peace Index Rankings 2008]. Vision of Humanity.</ref> Its cities also consistently rank among the world's most liveable.

[[Elizabeth II]], as the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], is the country's [[head of state]] and is represented by a [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], and executive political power is exercised by the [[Cabinet of New Zealand]].

It is unknown whether New Zealand had a Māori name before the arrival of Europeans, with  ''[[Aotearoa]]'' (which literally translates as "land of the long white cloud"){{sfn|King|2003|p=41}} originally just referring to the [[North Island]]. The use of the term to describe the whole country only occurred post-colonially and it is now commonly used in [[New Zealand English]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dialects of English: New Zealand English|page=72|first1=Jennifer|last1=Hay|first2=Margaret|last2=Maclagan|first3=Elizabeth|last3=Gordon|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2008|isbn=9780748625291}}</ref> [[Abel Tasman]] sighted the islands in 1642 and named them ''Staten Landt'', assuming they were connected to land off the southern tip of South America.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Wilson|title=European discovery of New Zealand - Abel Tasman|publisher=[[Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/2|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> In 1645 Dutch [[cartographers]] renamed the islands ''Nova Zeelandia'' after the [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch province]] of [[Zeeland]].<ref name="StatenLandt">{{cite web| url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/3 |title=Tasman’s achievement |publisher=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=September 2007 |accessdate=16 February 2008 |last=Wilson |first=John}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|year=1986|chapter=The Search For The Southern Land|editor-last=Fraser|editor-first= B|title=The New Zealand Book Of Events|location=Auckland|publisher=[[Reed Methuen]]|page=52–54}}</ref> British explorer [[James Cook]] subsequently [[anglicised]] the name to New Zealand.{{#Tag:ref|Zeeland is spelt "Zealand" in English and the Dutch regional language of [[Zeelandic]].

The population was divided into [[iwi]] (tribes) and [[hapu|hapū]] (subtribes) which would cooperate, compete and sometimes fight with each other.

Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American [[History of whaling|whaling]], [[Seal hunting|sealing]] and trading ships. They traded food, metal tools, weapons and other goods for timber, food, artefacts, water, and on occasion sex.{{sfn|King|2003|p=122}}

The introduction of the [[potato]] and the [[musket]] transformed Māori agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, enabling longer and more sustained military campaigns.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=John|year=2004|title=Food, warfare and the impact of Atlantic capitalism in Aotearo/New Zealand|journal=Australasian Political Studies Association Conference: APSA 2004 Conference Papers|url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/apsa/docs_papers/Others/Fitzpatrick.pdf}}</ref> The resulting [[Musket Wars]] encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing between 30,000–40,000 Māori.<ref>{{Cite book  | first=  Barry |last=Brailsford  |  title = Arrows of Plague  | location= Wellington | year = 1972  | page = 35|publisher=Hick Smith and Sons|isbn=0456010602}}</ref> From the early 19th century, Christian [[missionaries]] began to settle New Zealand, eventually [[Religious conversion|converting]] most of the Māori population.

===Treaty of Waitangi===

Becoming aware of the lawless nature of European settlement and of increasing French interest in the territory, the British government appointed [[James Busby]] as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832.<ref name = "Busby"/> Busby failed to bring law and order to European settlement, but did oversee the introduction of the first national flag on 20 March 1834.

===Early government===

New Zealand, originally part of the colony of [[New South Wales]], became a separate [[Crown colony]] in 1841<ref>{{cite web|title=Crown colony era - the Governor-General|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/history-of-the-governor-general/crown-colony-era|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=March 2009|accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref> and Hobson moved the capital from [[Okiato]] to [[Auckland]]. The Māori were initially eager to trade with the settlers and many iwi became wealthy. As immigrant numbers increased, conflicts over land led to the [[New Zealand Land Wars]] of the 1860s and 1870s, resulting in the loss and confiscation of much Māori land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/new-zealands-19th-century-wars/introduction|title=New Zealand's 19th-century wars – overview|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|date=April 2009|accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

The colony gained a [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852|representative government in 1852]] and the [[1st New Zealand Parliament]] met in 1854.<ref name = "G and N">{{cite web|first=John |last=Wilson|title=Government and nation - The constitution|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/government-and-nation/3}}</ref> In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsible over all domestic matters other than native policy (control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s).<ref name = "G and N"/> Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony, premier [[Alfred Domett]] moved a resolution to transfer the capital to a locality near the [[Cook Strait]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Temple|first=Philip|year=1980|title=Wellington Yesterday|isbn=0-86868-012-5|publisher=John McIndoe|authorlink=Philip Temple}}</ref> Wellington was chosen due to its harbour and central location, with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865.
