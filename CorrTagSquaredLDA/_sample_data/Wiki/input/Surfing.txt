'''Surfing''' is  a [[surface water sports|surface water sport]] in which a person (the surfer) rides a board (the [[surfboard]]) on the [[crest (physics)|crest]] of a [[wind wave|wave]] as it carries the surfer towards the [[shore]].

Two major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are [[longboard (surfing)|longboarding]] and [[shortboard]]ing, reflecting differences in surfboard design including surfboard length, and riding style. 

In [[tow-in surfing]] (most often, but not exclusively, associated with [[big wave surfing]]), a motorized water vehicle, such as a [[personal watercraft]] tows the surfer into  the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's higher speed, a speed that is generally, but not exclusively a speed that a self-propelled surfer can not match. 

Surfing-related sports such as [[paddleboarding]] and [[sea kayaking]] do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as [[kitesurfing]] and [[windsurfing]] rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. 

Recently with the use of [[V-drive]] boats, [[wake surfing]], riding the boat  [[wake]] has emerged.

For centuries surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]]. Surfing might have been observed first at [[Tahiti]] in Spring 1767 by [[Samuel Wallis]] and the crew members of the [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|''Dolphin'']]<ref>[http://www.hickoksports.com/history/surfing01.shtml Hickoksports.com]</ref> who quickly visited the island on 17 June 1767. Another candidate is the botanist [[Joseph Banks]]<ref>Fleming, F. (2005?) Off the Map. Tales of Endurance and Exploration, p. 154. Atlantic Monthly Press. </ref> being part of the [[First voyage of James Cook]] on the [[HMS Endeavour]], who arrived on 10 April 1769 on Tahiti. Lieutenant James King was the first one who wrote about the art of surfing on [[Hawaii]]<ref name="surfingforlife">
[http://www.surfingforlife.com/history.html History of Surfing] Surfing for Life</ref> when completing the journals of Captain [[James Cook]] upon Cook's death in 1779. 

When [[Mark Twain]] visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote, 
:"In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing."<ref>
[http://books.google.com/books?id=gjUOvGeK51MC Roughing It by Mark Twain]</ref> 

References to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact [[Samoa]], where surfing was called ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu'' (see Kramer, Samoa Islands) and [[Tonga]].

[[Swell (ocean)|Swell]] is generated when wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's [[fetch (geography)|fetch]]. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense [[low-pressure area|low pressure systems]].

Local wind conditions affect wave quality, since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate "offshore" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a [[Barreling wave|"barrel"]] or "tube" wave.

The most important influence on wave shape is the [[bathymetry|topography of the seabed]] directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the [[reef]] or bar front becomes stretched by [[diffraction]]. Each break is different, since the underwater topography of one place is unlike any other. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. [[Surf forecasting]] is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.

Swell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the north and south [[polar front]]s shift toward the [[Equator]]. The predominantly westerly winds generate swells that advance eastward, so waves tend to be largest on west coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s cause the [[isobar (meteorology)|isobar]]s to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.<!-- what is an undulated isobar? -->

East coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving [[anti-cyclone|highs]] inhibits their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however they can still generate heavy swells, since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels, since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.

During summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. [[Tropical cyclone]]s form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño & La Niña]] cycles. Their movements are unpredictable. They can move westward as in 1979, when [[Pre-1980 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons#Cyclone Kerry 2|Tropical Cyclone Kerry]] wandered for three weeks across the [[Coral Sea]] and into [[Queensland]] before dissipating.

Surf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where [[tradewinds]] ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.

===Wave intensity===
[[File:Wavemodel.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[geometry]] of tube shape can be represented as a ratio between length and width. A perfectly cylindrical [[vortex]] has a ratio of 1:1, while the classic almond-shaped tube is nearer 3:1. When width exceeds length, the tube is described as "square".|alt=Drawing showing cross-section of a wave with the top curling from left to right over an air-filled region known as its ''tube''.

===Artificial reefs===
The value of good surf has even prompted the construction of [[artificial reef]]s and sand bars to attract surf tourism. Of course, there is always the risk that one's vacation coincides with a "flat spell." Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also disapate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion.  
[[Wave pool]]s aim to solve that problem, by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can [[simulate]] good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the proper power to actually surf. The Sea Gaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, is a prime example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate powerful waves with up to 10 foot faces, the specialized pump holds water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allows the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames can be directed from this ingenious pump design providing for rippable surf, even barrel rides. Many professional surfers have demonstrated how hard the simuated waves can be "ripped."  The Ocean Dome, although revolutionary and surfing-wise successful, cost about $2 billion to build and is incredibly expensive to maintain.<ref>[http://www.surfline.com/mag/pulse/2000/nov/11_8_japan.cfm Surfline.com]</ref>

The availability of free [[Numerical weather prediction|model data]] from the [[NOAA]] has allowed the creation of several [[surf forecasting]] websites.

An artificial reef known as [[Chevron Reef]], was constructed in [[El Segundo, California]] in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the project was a failure, and the reef failed to produce any quality waves . In Kovalam, Southwest India, a recently constructed artificial reed has successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and a habitat to which marine life has flocked.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indias-first-artificial-reef-to-protect-Kovalam/articleshow/5951403.cms India's first artificial reef to protect Kovalam]</ref> ASR Ltd., a New Zealand based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on another in Boscombe, England.

==Surfers and surf culture==
{{Main|Surf culture}}
[[File:Shaka-sign.png|left|The [[Shaka sign]].|thumb|alt=Photo of back of human wrist and hand. The thumb and pinkie are extended and the other fingers are folded against the palm.]]
Surfers represent a diverse [[surf culture|culture]] based on riding the  waves. Some people practice surfing as a [[recreation]]al activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Within the United States, surfing culture is most dominant in [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Hawaii]]. Some historical markers of the culture included the [[woodie]], the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as [[boardshorts]], the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing.


The sport of surfing now represents a multi-billion dollar industry especially in [[Surf culture#Fashion|clothing and fashion]] markets. Some people make a radical career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships.

When the waves were flat, surfers persevered with [[skateboarding|sidewalk surfing]], which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating.

==Maneuvers==
[[File:Mavericks and surfer.jpg|A surfer at [[Mavericks (location)|Mavericks]]|thumb|250px]]
Surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave. Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (white water) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all. 

A surfer is respected if he catches a wave in the middle and maneuvers his way to the shoulder (or edge) of the breaking wave. Conversely, a surfer who takes off on the shoulder often becomes an obstacle for more skilled surfers taking off in the 'impact zone' and is deemed a shoulder hopper. Surfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in challenging conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and ''carving'' (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the ''floater'' (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and ''off the lip'' (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the ''air'' whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely and re-enters the wave. 

===Tube ride===
[[file:surf ouakam.ogg|thumb|right|Riding a small tube.]]
The tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing.  As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position him / her self actually inside the wave as it's breaking.  This is known as a tube ride. If you are watching from shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. If the surfer succeeds in bulleting out of the tube, it was a great ride. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more awesome the ride. Some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java.

''Hanging Ten'' and ''Hanging Five'' are moves usually specific to longboarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's [[toes]] off the edge, also known as [[noseriding]]. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five [[toes]] off the edge. 

Cutback:  Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.  

Floater:  Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.  

Top-Turn:  Turn off the top of the wave.  Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.  

Air / Aerial:  Launching the board off the wave entirely, then re-entering the wave.  Various airs include ollies, lien airs, method airs, and other skateboard-like maneuvers.

==Learning to surf==
Many popular surfing destinations, such as Hawaii, California, Florida, Rio de Janeiro, Ireland, Australia and Costa Rica,  have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin by instructors pushing students into waves on longboards. The longboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards.  Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Dang|url=http://www.surfscience.com/topics/learn-to-surf/|title=Learn To Surf|publisher=''surfscience.com''|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref> 

Typical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. Popular surf locations such as Hawaii, Brazil, Mexico and Costa Rica offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. Surf spots more conducive to instruction typically offer conditions suitable for learning, most importantly, [[sand bar]]s or sandy bottom breaks with consistent waves.

Surfing can be broken into several skills: drop in positioning to catch the wave, the pop-up, and positioning on the wave. Paddling out requires strength but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (''duck diving'', ''eskimo roll''). Drop in positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking.<ref>
[http://www.learnhowtosurf.info/how-to-surf/ The quick guide on how to surf]</ref>

Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a [[Balance board]] or [[swing boarding]] helps novices master the art.

==Equipment==

[[File:1999 - Surf à Waikiki Beach Honolulu Hawaï.jpg|thumb|Longboards at [[Waikiki beach]]|alt=Photo of dozens of surfboards on rack. Each board is perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the other boards. Ocean in background.|left]]
Surfing can be done on various equipment, including [[surfboard]]s, [[Longboard (surfing)|longboards]], [[Stand up paddle surfing|Stand Up Paddle boards (SUP's)]] , [[bodyboard]]s, Boogieboards, [[Waveski|wave skis]], [[skimboard]]s, [[kneeboard]]s, surf mats and macca's trays. 

[[Surfboard]]s were originally made of solid wood and were  large and heavy (often up to {{Convert|12|ft|m}} long and {{lb to kg|100}}). Lighter [[balsa wood]] surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.

Most modern surfboards are made of [[polyurethane]] foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or "stringers", fiberglass cloth, and [[polyester resin]]. An emerging board material is [[epoxy]] (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional [[fiberglass]]. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as [[carbon fiber]] and variable-flex composites.

Since epoxy surfboards are lighter, they will float better than a fiberglass board of similar size, shape and thickness.  This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional fiberglass board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from fiberglass.

Other equipment includes a [[Surfboard leash|leash]] (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), [[surf wax]], traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as ''skegs'') which can either be permanently attached (''glassed-on'') or interchangeable. 

[[Sportswear]] designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as ''boardwear'' (the term is also used in [[snowboarding]]). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or [[boardshorts]] are worn, and occasionally [[rash guard]]s; in cold water surfers can opt to wear [[wetsuit]]s, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of [[titanium]] to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. 

There are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. Modern [[Surfboard#Variations|longboard]]s, generally 9 to {{Convert|10|ft|m}} in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional ''walking'' maneuvers, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing.

The modern [[Surfboard#Variations|shortboard]] began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common ''thruster'' style, defined by its three fins, usually around {{Convert|6|to|7|ft|m}} in length. The thruster was invented by Australian shaper [[Simon Anderson]].

Midsize boards, often called [[Surfboard#Variations|funboard]]s, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more floation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical. 

:"It is the happy medium of mediocrity," writes Steven Kotler. "Funboard riders either have nothing left to prove or lack the skills to prove anything."<ref>{{

There are also various niche styles, such as the ''Egg'', a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The ''Fish'', a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a ''swallow tail''). The Fish often has two or four [[Surfboard Fins|fins]] and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the ''Gun'', a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.<br clear = all>

===Famous surfing locations===
==== The [[Jeffreys Bay]] Surf Break, [[Eastern Cape]] [[South Africa]]====

The break is regarded as one of the best right hand point breaks in the entire world, in both consistency and quality, in season.  It has been divided up into several sections, including, from the top of the point, Kitchen Windows, Magna tubes, Boneyards, Supertubes, Impossibles, Tubes, the Point, and Albatross. "Supertubes", which itself breaks for about 300m or more, is regarded as the best part of the wave. On rare occasions (large wave sizes, wide-breaking waves, and even swells), Boneyards can link up all the way to the Point for a ride over one kilometer long. The most consistent waves occur between about May to mid September, also often coinciding with offshore winds, although good waves can occasionally occur at other times of the year.[citation needed]

The initial discovery and promotion of the wave is curious. Another nearby right hand point wave at [[St. Francis Bay]] (Bruce's Beauty) was first idolised and promoted in the cult classic surf movie The Endless Summer in the 1960s (although both [[Jeffreys Bay]] and St. Francis Bay were probably surfed much earlier). Surfers who travelled to the area soon stumbled upon the nearby [[Jeffreys Bay]] surf break, which was found to be not only a faster, more powerful, and hollower wave, but also much more consistent.

==== Severn Bore ( River Severn, United Kingdom ) ====

{{Main|Severn bore}}

'''The Severn Bore''' is a world-famous surfing location in [[Great Britain]], on the [[River Severn]]. Due to narrowing of the river, the wave height increases, with a record high of 9.2 ft in Oct 1966. The wave can often last several miles, and causes a rise in water level for over an hour after. It is located in the River Severn, a river separating towns such as Newport [[Wales]] and Bristol [[England]] . The [[Surf break|break]] is caused by an tidal water from the [[Bristol Channel]] moving up the [[Severn Estuary]]. 

==== Punta Roca ( La Libertad, El Salvador ) ====

{{Main|La Libertad, La Libertad}}

Also known as "Way To California", it was founded by the British colonist Sir Francis Drake while on route to northern California, El Puerto has been home to many foreigners.El Puerto is home to one of the best right points in [[Central America]], known for its fast hollow, pulsing, over 30-second ride waves. Punta Roca (also called "La Punta" by local surfers) has been the perfect spot for many known surfers who back in the 1970s discovered the point with only a few local surfers brave enough to venture into its rocky bottom plane. It is known that legend Gerry Lopez, travelled frequently to this surf spot back in the 70's encouraging a new wave of locals to get into the sport. By the 1980s, [[El Salvador]] went through a civil war, and getting to the point was rather dangerous slowing visitors, and with that, a scarcity of surf boards to the locals whose only means of getting a surf board was by travelers leaving them behind in exchange of guidance and accommodations. Local legend, "Yepi" was one the first of his generation to take on full self-support and help maintain the sport, a popular activity among locals. Locals have also been increasing the popularity of the sport through out the country by offering custom surf tours to tourists and visitors in the region.

The main wave extends from La Punta to the township, a distance of about 800m, although single rides do not normally connect along this whole distance. On a good 6 to 8 feet day (Hawaiian scale), the top part of the point produces the best waves, giving a ride of about 300m or more. The wave features a relatively easy takeoff with long, fast, powerful walls, with longer hollow barrels on the best days. This wave works from about 3 to 12 feet (Hawaiian scale), and can barrel anywhere along the point, but most often closest to the takeoff area. The main takeoff is close to a dangerous rock which often sticks out of the water, and has caused injuries. It works on all tides, although low tide probably has more barrels. The wave is unusual in that it often breaks at a slight angle to the shoreline, hitting it slightly squarely, creating powerful and fast walls. It can be difficult to get out the back in large swells, and the rocky shoreline is notorious for its rather difficult entry.

Further down the point are a few other breaks, including next to the cemetery and in the town itself. These are less crowded and can produce waist-high waves on occasions, but the world-class section of the point is way on the outside.

Other surf spots around the region include: Conchalio, La Paz, San Diego, EL Zunzal, La Bocana, El Zonte

==== Mavericks ( California ) ====

{{Main|Mavericks (location)}}

[[File:Mavericks wave breaks.jpg|4-frames image that shows the famous [[Surf break|break]] of Mavericks|thumb|250px]]
'''Maverick's''' or '''Mavericks''' is a world-famous surfing location in [[Northern California]]. It is located approximately one-half mile (0.8&nbsp;km) from shore in [[Pillar Point Harbor]], just north of [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]] at the village of [[Princeton-by-the-Sea, California|Princeton-By-The-Sea]]. After a strong winter storm in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], waves can routinely crest at over 25 feet (8m) and top out at over 50 feet (15m). The [[Surf break|break]] is caused by an unusually-shaped underwater rock formation.

==== Pipeline ( Oahu, Hawaii ) ====

{{Main|Banzai Pipeline}} 

'''Pipeline''' is a surf reef break located in [[Hawaii]], off Ehukai Beach Park in [[Pupukea, Hawaii|Pupukea]] on [[O'ahu]]'s [[North Shore (O`ahu)|North Shore]]. The spot is notorious and famous for its huge waves breaking in shallow water just above its sharp and cavernous reef, forming large, hollow and thick curls of water that surfers can ride inside of. There are three [[reefs]] at Pipeline in progressively deeper water further out to sea that activate at various power levels applied by ocean [[Swell (ocean)|swells]].

==== Teahupoʻo ( Tahiti ) ====

{{Main|Teahupo'o}}

'''Teahupoʻo''' (pronounced cho-po) is a world-renowned [[List of surfing areas|surfing location]] off the south-west of the island of [[Tahiti]], [[French Polynesia]], southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is known for its heavy, glassy [[Ocean surface wave|waves]], often reaching 2 to 3 m (7 to 10&nbsp;ft) and higher. It is the site of the annual [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]] Pro Tahiti surf competition, part of the [[World championship tour (WCT) surfing|World Championship Tour (WCT)]] of the [http://www.aspworldtour.com ASP World Tour] professional surfing circuit.

==== Zicatela Beach ( Mexican Pipeline ) ====
{{Main|Puerto Esondito, Oaxaca}}

'''Zicatela''' is a beach located in the town of [[Puerto Escondito, Oaxaca]]. Nicknamed the "Mexican Pipeline" due to the similar power and shape of the Banzai Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu, the wave that breaks on Zicatela Beach draws an international crowd of surfers, bodyboarders and their entourages. Mid to late summer is low season for tourists, but a prime time for waves and international tournaments. A number of international competitions such as the [[ESPN X Games]], and the MexPipe Challenge have taken place.

==Dangers==
===Drowning===
Surfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent danger of [[drowning]]. (Anyone at any age can learn to surf, but must have at least intermediate swimming skills.) Although the board assists a surfer in staying [[buoyant]], it cannot be relied on for floation if it becomes separated from the user.<ref>
[http://www.surfinghandbook.com/ocean-safety.html Ocean Safety]</ref> The leash, which is attached at the ankle, keeps the surfer connected to the board for convenience but does not prevent drowning. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they've acquired the advanced skills necessary to handle bigger waves and challenging conditions.

Top surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions. Some drownings occurred as a result of leashes tangling with reefs, holding the surfer underwater. In very large waves such as [[Waimea]] or [[Mavericks (location)|Mavericks]], a leash may be undesirable, because the water can drag the board for long distances, holding the surfer underneath the wave.

===Collisions===
[[File:Surfer in santa cruz 14.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A surfer exiting a closeout|alt=Photo of surfer catapulted into the air with feet higher than head at 45 degree angle to surface]]
Under the wrong set of conditions, anything that a surfer's body can come in contact with is potentially a danger, including sand bars, rocks, reefs, surfboards, and other surfers.<ref>
[http://www.surfingsandiego.com/hardbottoms.asp Hard Bottom Surf Dangers]</ref> Collisions with these objects can sometimes cause injuries such as cuts and scrapes and in rare instances, death.

Surfers often jump off jetties, bridges, wharves and other structures to reach the surf. If the timing is wrong they can hurt themselves or their equipment.<ref>citation needed</ref>  

A large number of injuries, up to 66%,<ref>
[http://www.surfboardshack.com/safety.html The Dangers of Surfing]</ref> are caused by collision with a surfboard (nose or fins). Fins can cause deep lacerations and cuts, as well as bruising. While these injuries can be minor, they can open the skin to infection from the sea; groups like [[Surfers Against Sewage]] campaign for cleaner waters to reduce the risk of infections.  Local bugs and disease can be a dangerous factor when surfing around the globe.<ref>[http://surfshop.com/rip-andy-irons-1329 Andy Irons dies from Dengue Fever]</ref>

Falling off a surfboard or colliding with others, is commonly referred to as a ''wipeout''.

===Marine life===
[[Marine biology|Sea life]] can sometimes cause injuries and even fatalities.

[[Rip current|Riptides]] endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Rip currents are water channels that flow away from shore. Since these currents lurk in seemingly calm waters, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers can be swept away. A riptide usually has a width of forty or fifty feet. By paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can escape the rip current.<ref>

===Seabed===
The [[Seabed]] can pose dangers for the surfers. If a surfer is to fall while riding a wave, the wave will then toss him around, usually downwards. Whether it'd be a reef break or beach break, plenty of surfers have been seriously injured or even died because of the great collision with the bottom of the sea. [[Seabed]]s can get very shallow, especially, on beach breaks, during low tide. Cyclops, [[Western Australia]], for example is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to 10 metres high. Yet, the [[reef]] below is only about 2 metres deep.
