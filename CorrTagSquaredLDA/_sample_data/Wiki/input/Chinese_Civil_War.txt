The '''Chinese Civil War''' was a [[civil war]] fought between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party), the governing party of the [[Republic of China]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC),<ref name="gk">Gay, Kathlyn. [2008] (2008). 21st Century Books. Mao Zedong's China. ISBN 0822572850. pg 7</ref>, for the control of [[China]] which eventually led to China's division into [[two Chinas]], [[Republic of China]] (now commonly known as [[Taiwan]]) and [[People's Republic of China]] ([[Mainland China]]).  The war began in April 1927, amidst the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]].<ref name="Hutchings">Hutchings, Graham. [2001] (2001). Modern China: A Guide to a Century of Change. Harvard University Press. ISBN 0674006585.</ref> 

The war represented an [[Ideology|ideological]] split between the Nationalist KMT, and the  Communist CPC. In [[mainland China]] today, the last three years of the war (1947 - 1949) is more commonly known as the '''War of Liberation'''. 

The civil war continued intermittently until the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] interrupted it, resulting in the two parties forming a [[Second United Front]]. Japan's campaign was defeated in 1945, marking the end of [[World War II]], and [[China]]'s full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. After a further four years, 1950 saw a cessation of major military hostilities&mdash;with the newly founded People's Republic of China controlling [[mainland China]] (including [[Hainan|Hainan Island]]), and the [[Republic of China]]'s jurisdiction being restricted to [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[list of islands of the Republic of China|several outlying Fujianese islands]]. 

To this day, since no [[armistice]] or [[peace treaty]] has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Contemporary Law of Armed Conflict|author=Leslie C.

==Background==
The [[Qing Dynasty]], the last of the ruling Chinese dynasties, collapsed in 1911.<ref name="so" /> China was left under the control of several major and lesser warlords in the [[Warlord era]]. To defeat these warlords, who had seized control of much of [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]], the anti-monarchist and national unificationist [[Kuomintang]] party and its leader [[Sun Yat-sen]], sought the help of foreign powers. 

Sun Yat-sen's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1921 he turned to the [[Soviet Union]]. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Communist Party of China]], which would eventually found the [[People's Republic of China]]. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.

In 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative [[Adolph Joffe]] in [[Shanghai]] pledged Soviet assistance for China's unification.<ref name="March">March, G. Patrick. Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific. [1996] (1996). Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN 0275955664. pg 205.</ref> The [[Sun-Joffe Manifesto]] was a declaration for cooperation among the [[Comintern]], [[KMT]] and the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref name="March" /> [[Comintern]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]] arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The CPC joined the KMT to form the [[First United Front (China)|First United Front]].<ref name="Hsiung" />

In 1923, Sun Yat-sen sent [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from his [[Tongmeng Hui]] days, for several months' military and political study in [[Moscow]].<ref name="ChangH">Chang, H. H. Chang. [2007] (2007). Chiang Kai Shek - Asia's Man of Destiny. ISBN 1406758183. pg 126</ref> By 1924, Chiang became the head of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], and rose to prominence as Sun's successor as head of the KMT.<ref name="ChangH" />

The Soviets provided much of the studying material, organization, and equipment including munitions for the academy.<ref name="ChangH" /> The Soviets also provided education in many of the techniques for mass mobilization. With this aid Sun Yat-sen was able to raise a dedicated "army of the party," with which he hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CPC members were also present in the academy, and many of them became instructors, including [[Zhou Enlai]] who was made a political instructor of the academy.<ref name="HoA">Ho, Alfred K. Ho, Alfred Kuo-liang. [2004] (2004). China's Reforms and Reformers. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN 0275960803. pg 7.</ref>

Communist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis.<ref name="March" /> The CPC itself was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925.<ref name="Fairbank">Fairbank, John King. [1994] (1994). China: A New History. Harvard University Press. ISBN 0674116739.</ref> The KMT in 1923 had 50,000 members.<ref name="Fairbank" />

==Northern Expedition (1926&ndash;1928) and KMT-CPC split==
Just months after [[Sun Yat Sen]]'s death in 1925, Chiang Kai-shek, as commander-in-chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]], set out on the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]].<ref name="Fairbank" /> By 1926, however, the KMT had divided into left and right wing factions.<ref name="Fairbank" /> The Communist bloc within it was also growing. In the March 1926 [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]], after thwarting an alleged kidnapping attempt against him, Chiang imposed restrictions on CPC members' participation in the top KMT leadership and emerged as the pre-eminent KMT leader.

[[File:Communist purge.jpg|thumb|280px|Government troops rounding up prisoners.]]

In early 1927; the KMT-CPC rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CPC and the left wing of the KMT had decided to move the seat of the KMT government from [[Guangzhou]] to [[Wuhan]], where communist influence was strong.<ref name="Fairbank" /> But Chiang and [[Li Zongren]], whose armies defeated warlord [[Sun Chuanfang]], moved eastward toward [[Jiangxi]]. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand and Chiang denounced the leftists for betraying Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]] by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to [[Mao Zedong]], Chiang's tolerance of the CPC in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.<ref>Zedong, Mao. Thompson, Roger R. [1990] (1990). Report from Xunwu. Stanford University Press. ISBN 0804721823.</ref>

On April 7, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting arguing that communist activities were socially and economically disruptive, and must be undone for the national revolution to proceed. As a result of this, on April 12, Chiang turned on the CPC in Shanghai. The KMT was purged of leftists by the arrest and execution of hundreds of CPC members.<ref name="Brune">Brune, Lester H. Dean Burns, Richard Dean Burns. [2003] (2003). Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations. Routledge.

A Nation-state by Construction: Dynamics of Modern Chinese Nationalism. Stanford University Press. ISBN 0804750017.</ref> 

The massacre widened the rift between Chiang and [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Wuhan. Attempts were made by CPC to take cities such as [[Nanchang]], [[Changsha]], [[Shantou]], and Guangzhou. An armed rural insurrection, known as the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] was staged by peasants, miners and CPC members in [[Hunan]] Province led by [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name="Blasko">Blasko, Dennis J.

The CPC had been expelled from Wuhan by their left-wing KMT allies, who in turn were toppled by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT resumed the campaign against [[Warlord era|warlords]] and captured Beijing in June 1928.<ref name="Guo">Guo, Xuezhi. [2002] (2002).

==Encirclement Campaigns and the Long March (1927&ndash;1937)==
During the 1920s, Communist Party of China activists retreated underground or to the countryside where they fomented a military revolt, beginning the [[Nanchang Uprising]] on August 1, 1927.<ref name="Lee">Lee, Lai to. Trade Unions in China: 1949 To the Present. [1986] (1986). National University of Singapore Press.

It lasted until the [[Xi'an Incident]] when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form the [[Second United Front (China)|Second United Front]] against the invading [[Japan]]ese.

[[Image:Long-march.jpg|thumb|300px|A Communist leader addressing Long March survivors.]]

In 1930 the [[Central Plains War]] broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by [[Feng Yuxiang]], [[Yan Xishan]], and [[Wang Jingwei]]. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of [[Encirclement Campaigns|encirclement campaigns]]. There were a total of five campaigns.<ref name="Lynch">Lynch, Michael Lynch. Clausen, Søren. [2003] (2003). Mao. Routledge. ISBN 0415215773.</ref> The [[First Encirclement Campaign|first]] and [[Second Encirclement Campaign|second]] campaigns failed and the [[Third Encirclement Campaign|third]] was aborted due to the [[Mukden Incident]]. The [[Fourth Encirclement Campaign|fourth campaign]] (1932–1933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang’s armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao’s [[Soviet Chinese Republic]]. During these campaigns, the KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.

Finally, in late 1934, Chiang launched a [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign|fifth campaign]] that involved the systematic encirclement of the [[Jiangxi Soviet]] region with fortified [[blockhouse]]s.<ref name="Manwaring">Manwaring, Max G. Joes, Anthony James. [2000] (2000). Beyond Declaring Victory and Coming Home: The Challenges of Peace and Stability operations. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN 0275967689. pg 58</ref> Unlike in previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by five or so miles to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food source.<ref name="Manwaring" />

In October 1934, the CPC took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the troops of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than the KMT themselves) to escape [[Jiangxi]]. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of wasting their own men, and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered what Mao estimated as 12,500&nbsp;km (25,000 [[Li (unit)|Li]]), and was known as the famous [[Long March]].<ref name="Zhang">Zhang, Chunhou. Vaughan, C. Edwin. [2002] (2002). Mao Zedong as Poet and Revolutionary Leader: Social and Historical Perspectives. Lexington books. ISBN 0739104063. p 65, p 58</ref> 

The march ended when the CPC reached the interior of [[Shaanxi]]. [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] ally, the [[Ma clique]]. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000-100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000-8,000 made it to Shaanxi.<ref name="Bianco">[[Lucien Bianco|Bianco, Lucien]]. Bell, Muriel. [1971] (1971). Origins of the Chinese Revolution, 1915–1949. Stanford University Press. ISBN 0804708274. pg 68</ref> The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CPC, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.

==Second Sino-Japanese War (1937&ndash;1945)==
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[Image:Chiang Kai-shek enhanced.jpg|thumb|140px|The government of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was severely weakened in power by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].]]

During the [[Imperial Japan|Japan]]ese invasion and [[Imperial Japanese colonialism in Manchukuo|occupation of Manchuria]], Chiang Kai-shek, who saw the CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with the CPC to fight against the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. On December 12, 1936, KMT Generals [[Zhang Xueliang]] and [[Yang Hucheng]] kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek and forced him to a truce with the CPC. The incident became known as the [[Xi'an Incident]].<ref name="Ye">Ye, Zhaoyan Ye, Berry, Michael. [2003] (2003). Nanjing 1937: A Love Story. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0231127545.</ref> Both parties suspended fighting to form a [[Second United Front (China)|Second United Front]] to focus their energies and fighting against the Japanese.<ref name="Ye" /> In 1937, Japanese airplanes bombed Chinese cities and well-equipped troops overran north and coastal China.

The alliance of CPC and KMT was in name only.<ref name="Buss">Buss, Claude Albert. [1972] (1972). Stanford Alumni Association. The People's Republic of China and Richard Nixon. United States.</ref> Shunning conventional warfare, the CPC engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]] against the Japanese, while fending off attacks from the KMT. The level of actual cooperation and coordination between the CPC and KMT during [[World War II]] was at best minimal.<ref name="Buss" /> In the midst of the Second United Front, the CPC and the KMT were still vying for territorial advantage in "[[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|Free China]]" (i.e. areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by [[Manchukuo|Japanese puppet governments]]).<ref name="Buss" /> 

The situation came to a head in late 1940 and early 1941 when there were major clashes between the Communist and KMT forces. In December 1940, Chiang Kai-shek demanded that the CPC’s [[New Fourth Army]] evacuate [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] Provinces. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. In 1941 the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] led to several thousand deaths in the CPC.<ref name="schok">Schoppa, R. Keith. [2000] (2000). The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0231112769.</ref> It also ended the Second united front formed earlier to fight the Japanese.<ref name="schok" /> 

In general, developments in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] were to the advantage of the CPC, as their guerilla war effort had won them much popular support within the Japanese-occupied areas.  The KMT's resistance to the Japanese proved costly to Chiang Kai-shek. In 1944 the last major offensive, [[Operation Ichigo]] was launched by the Japanese against the KMT.<ref name="Lary">Lary, Diana. [2007] (2007). China's Republic. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521842565.</ref>

==Immediate post-war clashes (1945&ndash;1946)==
[[File:Mao and Chiang1945.jpg|thumb|250px|From left to right: US diplomat [[Patrick J. Hurley]], [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Chang Ch'ün]], Wang Shi Jie (王世杰), [[Mao Zedong]]]]
[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombs were dropped]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in 1945.<ref name="Lary" /> Under the terms of the Japanese [[unconditional surrender]] dictated by the [[United States]], Japanese troops were ordered to surrender to KMT troops and not to the CPC present in some of the occupied areas.<ref name="Zarrow">Zarrow, Peter Gue. [2005] (2005). China in War and Revolution, 1895–1949. Routledge. ISBN 0415364477. pg 338.</ref> In [[Manchuria]], however, where the KMT had no forces, the Japanese surrendered to the [[Soviet Union]]. Chiang Kai-Shek ordered the Japanese troops to remain at their post to receive the Kuomintang and not surrender their arms to the communists.<ref name="Zarrow" />

The first post-war peace negotiation was attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in [[Chongqing]] from August 28, 1945 to Oct 10, 1945.<ref name="Xu">Xu, Guangqiu. [2001] (2001). War Wings: The United States and Chinese Military Aviation, 1929–1949. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN 0313320047. pg 201.</ref> Both sides stressed the importance of a peaceful reconstruction, but the conference did not produce any concrete result.<ref name="Xu" /> Battles between the two sides continued even as the peace negotiation was in progress, until the agreement was reached in January 1946. However, large campaigns and full scale confrontations between the CPC and Chiang's own troops were temporarily avoided.

In the last month of [[World War II]] in [[East Asia]], Soviet forces launched the mammoth [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] to attack the Japanese in Manchuria and along the Chinese-Mongolian border.<ref name="Bright">Bright, Richard Carl. [2007] (2007). Pain and Purpose in the Pacific: True Reports of War. Trafford Publishing. ISBN 1425125441.</ref> This operation destroyed the fighting capability of the [[Kwantung Army]] and left the USSR in occupation of all of Manchuria by the end of the war. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year, Chiang Kai-shek realized that he lacked the resources to prevent a CPC takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure. He therefore made a deal with the Russians to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern material into the region. KMT troops were then [[airlift]]ed by the United States to occupy key cities in [[North China]], while the countryside was already dominated by the CPC. The Soviets spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive Manchurian industrial base (worth up to 2 billion dollars) and shipping it back to their war-ravaged country.<ref>Lilley, James. '' China hands : nine decades of adventure, espionage, and diplomacy in Asia '', PublicAffairs, New York, 2004</ref>

The truce fell apart in June 1946, when full scale war between CPC and KMT broke out on June 26. China then entered a state of [[civil war]] that lasted more than three years.<ref name="Hu">Hu, Jubin. [2003] (2003). Projecting a Nation: Chinese National Cinema Before 1949.

==Fighting in mainland China (1946&ndash;1950)==

===Background and two sides' forces===
After the war with the Japanese, the power balance became more profitable for the Chinese Communist Party. Their main force grew up to 1.2 million troops and the Militia force was 2 million. The Communist's "Liberated Zone" contained 19 base areas - made up 1/4 Chinese's territory and 1/3 Chinese's population - including many important towns and cities. Moreover, the Soviet Union handed over all of the captured Japanese weapons and some of the Soviet ones to the Communist force. The Chinese Communists received Northeastern China from the Soviets as well.<ref name = "nat">{{cite book |title= Lịch sử thế giới hiện đại |last= Nguyễn Anh Thái (chief author) |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= Nguyễn Quốc Hùng, Vũ Ngọc Oanh, Trần Thị Vinh, Đặng Thanh Toán, Đỗ Thanh Bình |year= 2002 |publisher= Giáo Dục Publisher |location= Ho Chi Minh City |isbn= 8-934980-11603 |page= |pages= 320–322 |url= |accessdate= |language = Vietnamese}}</ref> 

In March 1946, despite repeated requests from Chiang, the [[Soviet Red Army]] under the command of general [[Rodion Malinovsky|Malinovsky]] continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria while he secretly told the CPC forces to move in behind them, because Stalin wanted Mao to have firm control of at least the northern part of Manchuria before the complete withdrawal of the Soviets,<ref>Michael M Sheng, ''Battling Western Imperialism'', Princeton University Press, 1997, p.132 - 135</ref> which led to full-scale war for the control of the Northeast. These favourable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leaders: the more hard-line and firmer force finally gained the upper hand and defeated the opportunists.<ref name = "nat"/>

Although [[George Marshall|General Marshall]] stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC were being supplied by the Soviet Union,<ref>New York Times, 12 January 1947, p44.</ref> the CPC were able to capture a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks but it was not until large numbers of well trained KMT troops surrendered and joined the communist forces that the CPC were finally able to master the hardware.<ref>Zeng Kelin, ''Zeng Kelin jianjun zishu'' (General Zeng Kelin Tells his story), Liaoning renmin chubanshe, Shenyang, 1997. p. 112-3</ref> But despite the disadvantage in military hardware, the CPC's ultimate trump card was its land reform policy. The CPC continued to make the irresistible promise in the countryside to the massive number of landless and starving Chinese peasants that by fighting for the CPC they would be able to take farmland from their landlords.<ref>[[Ray Huang]], ''cong dalishi jiaodu du Jiang Jieshi riji'' (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's diary from a macro-history perspective), Chinatimes Publishing Press, Taipei, 1994, p. 441-3</ref> This strategy enabled the CPC to access an almost unlimited supply of manpower to use in combat as well as provide logistic support, despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many civil war campaigns.  For example, during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] alone the CPC were able to mobilize 5,430,000 peasants to fight against the KMT forces.<ref>[[Lung Ying-tai]], ''dajiang dahai 1949'', Commonwealth Publishing Press, Taipei, 2009, p.184</ref>

As for the Kuomintang, after the war with Japanese ended, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly moved the KMT troops to the newly liberated area and prevent the Communist force from receiving the Japanese's surrender.<ref name = "nat"/> The United States airlifted many KMT troops from central China to the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] ([[Manchuria]]). President Truman was very clear about what he described as "using the Japanese to hold off the Communists". In his memoirs he writes:

{{cquote|''It was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to guard the seaports".|||President Truman|<ref>Harry S.Truman, Memoirs, Vol. Two: Years of Trial and Hope, 1946–1953 (Great Britain 1956), p.66</ref>}}

Using the capacity "receiving the Japanese's surrender", the [[authoritative]] [[capitalist]] group in KMT's government occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties which was previously seized by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] in the past.<ref name = "nat"/> They also intensively gained troops and collected war supplies, preparing for the coming war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparation's methods somewhat caused many difficulties for the people's life. The rate of unemployed remarkably rose - as for Shanghai the unemployed rate was 37.5%.<ref name = "nat"/>

The United States strongly backed the force of the Kuomintang. Over 50,000 Marines were sent to guard strategic sites. 100,000 US troops was sent to [[Shandong]]. The US equipped and trained over 500,000 KMT troops, transport the KMT forces to the newly liberated zones and to surround the Communist's areas.<ref name = "nat"/> The United States also assisted the KMT with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new surplus military supplies and generous loans of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment.<ref>p23, U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, William Blum, Zed Books 2004 London.</ref> Within less than 2 year after the Sino-Japanese war, the KMT received 4.43 billion dollars from the US - most of which was military aid.<ref name = "nat"/>

===War breaks out===
With the breakdown of talks, an all-out war resumed. This stage is referred to in [[mainland China]] and Communist historiography as the "War of Liberation" ({{zh|s=解放战争|p=Jiěfàng Zhànzhēng|links=no}}). On 20 July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault to the Communist area with 113 brigades (1.6 million troops).<ref name= "nat"/> The final phase of the Chinese Civil War broke out.

Knowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CPC executed a "passive defense" tactic. They avoided the strong points of the KMT army and were ready to abandon their territories in order to preserve their forces. They also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible. This tactic seemed to be successful: after a year, the power balance became more favorable for the CPC. They wiped out 1.12 million KMT troops while their main troops grew to about 2 million men.<ref name= "nat"/>

[[Image:PLA Enters Peking.jpg|thumb|280px|The PLA enters Beijing in the [[Pingjin Campaign]] and control the later capital of PRC]]
In March 1947, the KMT achieved a symbolic victory by seizing the CPC capital of [[Yan'an]].<ref>Lilley, James R. China Hands: Nine Decades of Adventure, Espionage, and Diplomacy in Asia. ISBN 1586481363.</ref> But soon after that, the CPC started to counter-attack. On 30th June 1947, the CPC troops crossed the Huanghe river and moved to [[Dabie Mountains]] area, restored and developed the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]]. Right after that, the CPC forces in Northeastern China, [[North China]] and [[East China]] started to counter attack as well.<ref name= "nat"/> 

By late 1948 the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of [[Shenyang]] and [[Changchun]] and seized control of the Northeast after struggling through numerous set-backs while trying to take the cities, with the decisive [[Liaoshen Campaign]].<ref name="Westad">Westad, Odd Arne.

The capture of large KMT formations provided them with the tanks, heavy artillery, and other combined-arms assets needed to prosecute offensive operations south of the Great Wall. By April 1948 the city of [[Luoyang]] fell, cutting the KMT army off from [[Xi'an]].<ref name="Elleman">Elleman, Bruce A. Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795–1989. Routledge.

The [[Pingjin Campaign]] resulted in the Communist conquest of northern China lasting 64 days from November 21, 1948, to January 31, 1949.<ref name="Finkld">Finkelstein, David Michael. Ryan, Mark A.

They in turn killed, wounded or captured some 520,000 KMT during the campaign.<ref name="Finkld" />

After the three decisive Liaoshen, Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns, the CPC wiped out 144 regular and 29 non-regular KMT divisions, including 1.54 million veteran KMT troops. This effectively smashed the backbone of the KMT army.<ref name= "nat"/>

On 21 April, Communist forces crossed the [[Yangtze River]]. On 23 April, they captured Nanjing, capital of the KMT's [[Republic of China]].<ref name="Zhang" /> In most cases, the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. By late 1949, the People's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, only [[Tibet]] was left. The KMT government retreated from [[Nanjing]] on April 23 successively to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) until October 15, [[Chongqing]] until November 25, and [[Chengdu]] before retreating to [[Taipei]] on December 10.

In addition, the [[Ili Rebellion]] was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] backed revolt by the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] against the KMT from 1944-1949 as the Mongolians in the People's Republic were in a border dispute with the Republic of China.  A Chinese Muslim [[Hui people|Hui]] cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Cavalry regiment, was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=warlords+and+muslims&source=bl&ots=KzhMb-imkP&sig=LLAxJ3twoEaTpwSYwCNGE4lVXVE&hl=en&ei=ZAoXTPG8NMGqlAfk-rCmCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=14th&f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911-1949|author=Andrew D.

==Establishment of the People's Republic and the Kuomintang retreat to Taiwan==
[[Image:PRCFounding.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Mao Zedong]] proclaiming the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949.]]
On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]] with its capital at Beiping, which was renamed [[Beijing]]. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately 2 million Nationalist Chinese retreated from [[mainland China]] to the island of [[Taiwan]].<ref name="Cookc">Cook, Chris Cook. Stevenson, John. [2005] (2005).

{{Main|Cross-Strait relations}}
{{See also|Political status of Taiwan}}
Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan strait]]s to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.<ref name="BushR">Bush, Richard C. [2005] (2005). Untying the Knot: Making Peace in the Taiwan Strait. Brookings Institution Press. ISBN 081571288X.</ref>

In June 1949, the ROC declared a "closure" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of [[Min River (Fujian)|Min river]] in [[Fujian province]] to the mouth of the [[Liao River|Liao river]] in Manchuria.<ref name="Tsang">Tsang, Steve Yui-Sang Tsang. The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK, 1950–1958. [2006] (2006). I.B. Tauris. ISBN 1850438420. p 155, p 115-120, p 139-145</ref> Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.

After losing mainland China, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to [[Burma]] and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China during the [[Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958)]]. Their leader, General [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of [[Yunnan]]. Initially, the United States supported these remnants and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the [[United Nations]] in 1953, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954, nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.

After the ROC complained to the [[United Nations]] against the [[Soviet Union]] supporting the PRC, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 505]] was adopted on February 1, 1952 to condemn the Soviet Union.

Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On September 3, 1954, the [[First Taiwan Strait crisis]] began when the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] started shelling [[Quemoy]] and threatened to take the [[Dachen Islands]].<ref name="Tsang" /> On January 20, 1955, the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] took nearby [[Yijiangshan Island]], with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Formosa Resolution]] authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.<ref name="Tsang" /> The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung conference]].<ref name="Tsang" />

The [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] began on August 23, 1958 with air and naval engagements between the PRC and the ROC military forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of [[Quemoy]] (by the PRC) and [[Xiamen|Amoy]] (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.<ref name="Tsang" /> PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] ships to land supply, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7, the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On October 25, the PRC announced an "even-day ceasefire" &mdash; the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days.

Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war.

By 1984, PRC and ROC had public contacts with each other and cross-straits trade and investment has been growing ever since. Although the [[Taiwan strait]]s remain a potential flash point, regular direct air links were established in 2009.<ref name="so" />

The [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1995&ndash;96 escalated tensions between both sides when the PRC tested a series of missiles not far from Taiwan although, arguably, Beijing ran the test to shift the vote in favor of the KMT, already facing a challenge from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party which did not agree with the "One China Policy" shared by the CPC and KMT.<ref>(for missile test dating) Behnke, Alison. [2007] (2007). Taiwan in Pictures. Twenty-First Century Books. ISBN 082257148X.</ref>

With the election in 2000 of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]], a party other than the KMT gained the presidency for the first time in Taiwan.  The new president did not share the Chinese nationalist ideology of the KMT and CPC.  This led to tension between the two sides although trade and other ties continued to increase.

Since the election of President [[Ma Ying-Jeou]] (KMT) in 2008, significant warming of relations has resumed between Taipei and Beijing with high level exchanges between the ruling parties of both states such as the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|2005 Pan-Blue visit]] or the [[Chen-Chiang summit]] series.
