The '''Darfur Conflict'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3496731.stm |title=Q&A: Sudan's Darfur conflict |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/SD_DAR.htm |title=Reuters AlertNet - Darfur conflict |publisher=Alertnet.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> is an ongoing [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] conflict or [[civil war]] centered on the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]]. It began in February 2003 when the [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army]] (SLM/A) and [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) groups in Darfur took up arms, accusing the [[Politics of Sudan|Sudanese government]] of oppressing non-[[arab]] Sudanese in favor of [[Sudanese Arab]]s. One side of the conflict is composed mainly of the official Sudanese military and police, and the [[Janjaweed]], a Sudanese [[militia]] group recruited mostly from the [[Arab]] [[Abbala]] tribes of the northern [[Rizeigat]] region in Sudan; these tribes are mainly camel-herding [[nomad]]s. The other combatants are made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Zaghawa]], and [[Masalit]] ethnic groups. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supports the Janjaweed, it has been providing financial assistance and weapons to the militia and has been organizing joint attacks targeting civilians.<ref>{{cite news

The Sudanese government uses oil revenues to fund a military capacity that is in turn, used to conduct war in Darfur. Oil revenues collected from companies around the world fund the civil war as well as violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Sudan’s oil wealth has played a major part in enabling an otherwise poor government to fund the expensive bombers, helicopters and arms supplies which have allowed the Sudanese government to launch aerial attacks on towns and villages and fund militias to fight its proxy war in Darfur.<ref name= "Problem Companies"> [http://investorsagainstgenocide.net/problemcompanies], Investors Against Genocide.</ref> 

There are various estimates on [[Darfur Genocide#Mortality figures|the number of human casualties]], ranging from under twenty thousand to several hundred thousand dead, from either direct combat or starvation and disease inflicted by the conflict. There have also been mass displacements and coercive migrations, forcing millions into refugee camps or over the border and creating a large [[humanitarian crisis]].

The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February, 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue further peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks, and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8533097.stm |title=Will peace return to Darfur? |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-02-23 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> However, talks have been disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the February agreement.

== Criticism ==
Various sources have claimed it is a war waged by Muslim Arabs against Christian and Animist black Africans. However, this distinction is not always true as many of the victims of the atrocities in Darfur were also Muslim (albeit not Arab).<ref name="Genocide Debate 2005 pp. 123-133">Darfur and the Genocide Debate, Scott Straus, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 84, No. 1 (Jan. - Feb., 2005), pp. 123-133</ref> The conflict's origin goes back to land disputes between semi-nomadic livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture.<ref name="Genocide Debate 2005 pp. 123-133"/> Others opposed the usage of the term Arab and Black because all parties involved in the Darfur conflict—whether they are referred to as ‘Arab’ or as ‘African,’ are equally indigenous and equally Black. 'Arab' in the Sudanese context is different from Arab in the American context.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/darfur%20report.html| title= Darfur Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm |title=Language and Africa |publisher=[[Alik Shahadah]]|date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref>

The actual conflict is not only about race or religion, but about resources as the nomadic tribes facing drought are going after the territory of sedentary farmers.<ref>Bechtold, P. K. (2009). A History of Modern Sudan. Middle East Journal, 63(1), 149 - 150.</ref>

==International response==
{{Main|International response to the Darfur conflict}}
International attention to the Darfur conflict largely began with reports by the advocacy organizations Amnesty International in July 2003 and the [[International Crisis Group]] in December 2003. However, widespread media coverage did not start until the outgoing United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, [[Mukesh Kapila]], called Darfur the "world's greatest humanitarian crisis" in March 2004.<ref name="Prunier1">Prunier, pp. 124-148</ref> Organizations such as [[STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition]], later under the umbrella of [[Genocide Intervention Network]], and the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] emerged and became particularly active in the areas of engaging the United States Congress and President on the issue and pushing for divestment nationwide, initially launched by [[Adam Sterling]] under the auspice of the Sudan Divestment Task Force. Particularly strong advocates have additionally included: ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Nicholas Kristof]], Sudan scholar [[Eric Reeves]], Enough Project founder [[John Prendergast]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Samantha Power]], photographers [[Ryan Spencer Reed]], former [[USMC|Marine]] [[Brian Steidle]], actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her son [[Ronan Farrow]], Olympian [[Joey Cheek]], actress [[Angelina Jolie]], actors [[George Clooney]], and [[Don Cheadle]], actor [[Jonah Hill]], actress [[Salma Hayek]], [[Save Darfur Coalition]]'s David Rubenstein, [[Slovenia]]n humanitarian Tomo Kriznar, and all of those involved with the [[Genocide Intervention Network]].  A movement advocating for [[humanitarian intervention]] has emerged in several countries.

===United Nations===
===International Criminal Court===
In March 2005, the Security Council formally referred the situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, taking into account the report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, authorized by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564|UN Security Council Resolution 1564]] of 2004, but without mentioning any specific crimes.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://web.archive.org/web/20080625002301/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/N0529273.darfureferral.eng.pdf Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005)]|24.8&nbsp;KB}}</ref> Two permanent members of the Security Council, the United States and [[People's Republic of China|China]], abstained from the vote on the referral resolution.<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm Security Council Refers Situation in Darfur, Sudan, to Prosecutor of International Criminal Court], UN Press Release SC/8351, 31 March 2005</ref>

In April 2007, the Judges of the ICC issued arrest warrants against the former Minister of State for the Interior, [[Ahmed Haroun]], and a Janjaweed leader, [[Ali Kushayb]], for crimes against humanity and war crimes.<ref>[http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-ST20080605-ENG.pdf Statement by Mr. Luis Moreno Ocampo, The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, to the United Nations Security Council pursuant to UNSCR 1593 (2005)]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}, [http://www.icc-cpi.int/ International Criminal Court], 5 June 2008</ref> The Sudan Government said that the ICC had no jurisdiction to try Sudanese citizens and that it would not hand the two men over to authorities in the Hague.<ref>Staff.

On 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor filed ten charges of war crimes against Sudan's incumbent President Omar al-Bashir, three counts of genocide, five of crimes against humanity and two of murder. The Prosecutor has claimed that Mr. al-Bashir "masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their ethnicity. Leaders from three Darfur tribes are suing ICC prosecutor Luis-Moreno Ocampo for libel, defamation, and igniting hatred and tribalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2008-09/14/03.shtml |title=IslamOnline.net- News |publisher=Islamonline|date=14 September 2008 / Ramadan 14, 1429|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>

After an arrest warrant was issued for the Sudanese president in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to have the genocide charges added. However, the Pre-Trial Chamber found that there was no reasonable ground to support the contention that he had a specific intent to commit genocide (''dolus specialis''), which is an intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a protected group. The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. On February 3, 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the Pre-Trial Chamber had applied "an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor" and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to review based on the correct legal standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6670DB89-C6FF-45D4-8936-FF3F228FD961.htm |title=Judgment on Appeal |publisher=International Criminal Court |date=3 Feb. 2010}}</ref> In July, 2010, [[Sudan]]'s president [[Omar al-Bashir]] was finally charged by Hague for orchestrating Darfur genocide, three counts of genocide in Darfur by the [[International Criminal Court]].

===Criticism of international response===
[[Image:Save Darfur sign from New York .jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Save Darfur Coalition]] advocacy group coordinated a large rally in New York in April 2006]]
[[Gérard Prunier]], a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argued that the world's most powerful countries have largely limited themselves in expressing concerns and demand for the United Nations to take action in solving the genocide in Darfur. The UN, lacking both the funding and military support of the wealthy countries, has left the African Union to deploy a token force (AMIS) without a mandate to protect civilians. In the lack of foreign political will to address the political and economic structures that underlie the conflict, the [[international community]] has defined the Darfur conflict in humanitarian assistance terms and debated the label of "genocide."<ref name="Prunier1" />

On 16 October 2006, [[Minority Rights Group International|Minority Rights Group]] (MRG) published a critical report, challenging that the UN and the [[great power]]s could have prevented the deepening crisis in Darfur and that few lessons appear to have been drawn from their ineptitude during the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. MRG's executive director, Mark Lattimer, stated that: "this level of crisis, the killings, rape and displacement could have been foreseen and avoided ... Darfur would just not be in this situation had the UN systems got its act together after Rwanda: their action was too little too late."<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=136&art_id=iol1160956523318B235 "UN could have averted Darfur crisis – MRG"], ''Independent Online'', 16 October 2006</ref> On 20 October, 120 genocide survivors of [[The Holocaust]], and the [[Khmer Rouge period (1975–1979)|Cambodian]] and Rwandan Genocides, backed by six aid agencies, submitted an open letter to the European Union, calling on them to do more to end the atrocities in Darfur, with a UN peacekeeping force as "the only viable option." [[Aegis Trust]] director, James Smith, stated that while "the African Union has worked very well in Darfur and done what it could, the rest of the world hasn't supported those efforts the way it should have done with sufficient funds and sufficient equipment."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6069600.stm "Darfur call by genocide survivors"], ''[[BBC]]'', 20 October 2006</ref>

[[Human Rights First]] claimed that over 90% of the light weapons currently being imported by Sudan and used in the conflict are from China;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=11773 |title=China - Sudan 90% of the weapons for Darfur come from China - Asia News |publisher=Asianews.it |date= |accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> however, according to [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI)'s "Arms Transfers Data for 2007", in 2003–2007, Sudan received 87 per cent of its major conventional weapons from [[Russia]] and 8 per cent from China.<ref>[http://www.sipri.org/contents/armstrad/PR_AT_data_2007.html/view?searchterm=darfur "SIPRI Arms Transfers Data for 2007"], ''[[SIPRI]]'', 2008</ref> Human rights advocates and opponents of the Sudanese government portray China's role in providing weapons and aircraft as a cynical attempt to obtain oil just as colonial powers once supplied African chieftains with the military means to maintain control as they extracted natural resources.<ref>{{cite news

==Mortality figures==

In September 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to [[starvation]]. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence.<ref name="How many have died">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4268733.stm How many have died in Darfur?] By Russell Smith (BBC) 16 February 2005</ref> A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died,<ref name="death toll may be 300,000">[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30582172.htm Darfur death toll may be 300,000, say UK lawmakers] (Reuters), 30 March 2005</ref> and others have estimated even more.

In March 2005, the UN's [[Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Emergency Relief Coordinator]] [[Jan Egeland]] estimated that 10,000 were dying each month excluding deaths due to ethnic violence.<ref name="death estimate soars">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4349063.stm UN's Darfur death estimate soars] (BBC) 14 March 2005</ref> An estimated 2.7 million people had at that time been displaced from their homes, mostly seeking refuge in camps in Darfur's major towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/178659/5-un-peacekeepers-killed-in-darfur-attacks/ |title=GMA News, 5 UN Peacekeepers Killed in Darfur Attacks |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> Two hundred thousand had fled to neighboring Chad.

In May 2005, the [[Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters]] (CRED) of the School of Public Health of the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] published an analysis of mortality in Darfur. Their estimate stated that from September 2003 to January 2005, between 98,000 and 181,000 persons had died in Darfur, including from 63,000 to 146,000 excess deaths.<ref name="Darfur: Counting the Deaths: Mortality Estimates from Multiple Survey Data">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedat.be/sites/default/files/ID%20214%20-%20Counting%20the%20death%20(2).pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Letters9 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref>

On 28 April 2006, Dr. Eric Reeves argued that "extant data, in aggregate, strongly suggest that total excess mortality in Darfur, over the course of more than three years of deadly conflict, now significantly exceeds 450,000," but this has not been independently verified.<ref name="Quantifying Genocide in Darfur">[http://www.sudanreeves.org/Article102.html Quantifying Genocide in Darfur] Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], 28 April 2006</ref>

The UN disclosed on 22 April 2008 that it might have underestimated the Darfur death toll by nearly 50%.<ref name=bodycount>{{cite news|title=U.N.: 100,000 more dead in Darfur than reported|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/04/22/darfur.holmes/index.html?eref=rss_topstories|publisher=CNN|date=2008-04-22|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref>

In July 2009, the Christian Science Monitor published an op-ed stating that many of the published mortality rates have been misleading because they include a large number of people who have died of disease and malnutrition, as well as those who have died from direct violence. Therefore, when activist groups make statements indicating that "four hundred thousand people have been ''killed''," they are misleading the public.<ref name="The genocide in Darfur is not what it seems">[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0819/p09s02-coop.html The Genocide in Darfur is not what it seems] Dr. [[Marc Gustafson]], 19 August 2009</ref>

In January 2010, The [[Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters]] published an article in a special issue of [[The Lancet]]. The article, entitled [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2961967-X/abstract ''Patterns of mortality rates in Darfur Conflict''], estimated, with 95% confidence, that the excess number of deaths is between 178,258 and 461,520 (the mean being 298,271), with 80% of these due to diseases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2961967-X/abstract |title=Patterns of mortality rates in Darfur conflict |publisher=The Lancet |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> 51 International peacekeepers have been killed in Darfur.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} An accurate picture of the state of the crisis in Darfur has been increasingly difficult to garner with former aid workers reporting that their remaining colleagues are "self-censoring" for fear of being expelled, and an Oct. 2010 crackdown by the Sudanese government on Radio Dabanga, the remaining uncensored Darfuri media outlet.<ref>Hamilton, Rebecca [http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/radio-dabanga-raid-sudan-targets-last-uncensored-media-outlet-ground "In Radio Dabanga Raid, Sudan Targets Last Uncensored Media Outlet on the Ground"], ''Washington Post,” Nov. 10, 2010, via Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</ref>

Violence in Darfur spread over the border to  eastern Chad, but not as far as the capital [[N'Djamena]], and the [[Central African Republic]]. In Chad, notably, the Janjaweed were accused of incursions and attacks. Hundreds of aid workers in Chad have already been evacuated due to increased tension between rebel groups and military forces. Meanwhile, the Janjaweed have ventured deep into Chad to conduct assaults, resulting in the fleeing of nearly 100,000 Chadians.<ref name="csm">{{cite news | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1211/p01s02-woaf.html | title = Darfur Crisis crosses Border | date = 11 December 2006 | accessdate = 2009-12-10 | publisher = The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>
