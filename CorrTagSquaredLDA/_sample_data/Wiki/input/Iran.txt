==Name==
{{Main|Iran (word)|Name of Iran}}
The term ''Iran'' (ایران) in modern Persian derives from the [[Proto-Iranian]] term ''Aryānā,'' first attested in [[Zoroastrianism]]'s [[Avesta]] tradition.<ref name="Bailey_Arya">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Bailey|first=Harold Walter|authorlink=Harold Walter Bailey|title=Arya|pages=681–683|year=1987|volume=2|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|location=New York|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v2f7/v2f7a004.html}}</ref> ''Ariya-'' and ''Airiia-'' are also attested as an ethnic designator in [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions. The term ''Ērān'', from [[Middle Persian]] ''Ērān'' ([[Pahlavi scripts|written as]] ''ʼyrʼn'') is found on the inscription that accompanies the investiture relief of [[Ardashir I]] at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].<ref name="MacKenzie">{{cite encyclopedia|last=MacKenzie|first=David Niel|title=Ērān, Ērānšahr|year=1998|volume=8|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|publisher=Mazda|location=Costa Mesa|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v8f5/v8f545.html}}</ref> In this inscription, the king's appellation in [[Middle Persian]] contains the term ''ērān'' (Pahlavi ''ʼryʼn''), while in the [[Parthian language]] inscription that accompanies it, the term ''aryān'' describes Iran. In [[Ardeshir I|Ardeshir]]'s time, ''ērān'' retained this meaning, denoting ''the people'' rather than ''the state''. The name ''Iran'' is a [[cognate]] of ''Aryan'', and means "Land of the [[Aryan]]s".<ref name="hinduwebsite">[http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/arya.asp hinduwebsite.com, "The Concepts of Hinduism — Arya"]. Retrieved 1 October 2007.</ref><ref name="wiscper">[http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~aoliai/languagepage/iranianlanguages.htm LSS.wis.edu], "Iranian Languages", Political, Social, Scientific, Literary & Artistic (Monthly) October 2000, No. 171, Dr. Suzan Kaviri, pp. 26–7retrieved 1 October 2007</ref><ref name="about.com">[http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/persianempiremaps/qt/Iran.htm About.com], "Iran — The Ancient Name of Iran", N.S. Gill. Retrieved 1 October 2007.</ref>

Notwithstanding this inscriptional use of ''ērān'' to refer to the [[Iranian peoples]], the use of ''ērān'' to refer to the geographical empire is also attested in the early Sassanid period. An inscription relating to [[Shapur I]], Ardashir's son and immediate successor, includes regions which were not inhabited primarily by Iranians in ''Ērān'' regions, such as [[Armenia]] and the [[Caucasus]]."<ref name="Gignoux_Aneran">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Anērān|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v2f1/v2f1a035.html|accessdate=25 February 2008 }}</ref> In [[Kartir|Kartir's]] inscriptions the high priest includes the same regions in his list of provinces of the antonymic ''Anērān''.<ref name="Gignoux_Aneran"/> Both ''ērān'' and ''aryān'' come from the [[Proto-Iranian]] term ''Aryānām'', (Land) of the (Iranian) Aryas. The word and concept of [[Airyanem Vaejah]] is present in the name of the country Iran inasmuch as Iran (''Ērān'') is the modern Persian form of the word ''Aryānā''.

Since the Sassanid era the country has been known to its own people as Iran; however, to the western world, the official name of Iran from the 6th century BC until 1935 was '''Persia''' or similar foreign language translations (''La Perse'', ''Persien'', ''Perzie'', etc.).<ref name="artarena"/> In that year, [[Reza Shah]] asked the international community to call the country by the name "Iran". A few years later, some Persian scholars protested to the government that changing the name had separated the country from its past, so in 1959<ref name="yarshater1">Yarshater, Ehsan [http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm Persia or Iran, Persian or Farsi], ''Iranian Studies'', vol. XXII no. 1 (1989)</ref> [[Mohammad Reza Shah]] announced that both terms could officially be used interchangeably. Now both terms are common, but "Iran" is used mostly in the modern political context and "Persia" in a cultural and historical context. Since the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, the official name of the country has been the "Islamic Republic of Iran."

Iran consists of the [[Iranian Plateau]] with the exception of the coasts of the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Khuzestan]]. It is one of the world's most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged [[mountain range]]s that separate various [[drainage basin|basins]] or [[plateau]]x from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]] and [[Alborz]] Mountains; the last contains Iran's highest point, [[Mount Damavand]] at {{convert|5610|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which is not only the country's highest peak but also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the [[Hindu Kush]].<ref>[http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html SurfWax: News, Reviews and Articles On Hindu Kush]. Retrieved 25 February 2008.</ref>

The northern part of Iran is covered by dense rain forests called [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests|Shomal]] or the [[Jungles of Iran]]. The eastern part consists mostly of [[desert]] basins such as the [[Dasht-e Kavir]], Iran's largest desert, in the north-central portion of the country, and the [[Dasht-e Lut]], in the east, as well as some [[Salt lake (geography)|salt lakes]]. This is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain clouds to reach these regions. The only large [[plain]]s are found along the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, where Iran borders the mouth of the [[Shatt al-Arab]] (or the Arvand Rūd) river. Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and the [[Sea of Oman]].

The city contains a wide variety of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural]] sites ranging from the 11th to the 19th century.

The fourth major city of Iran is [[Tabriz]] (population 1,378,935), the capital of the [[East Azerbaijan province]]. It is also the second industrial city of Iran after [[Tehran]]. [[Tabriz]] had been the second largest city in Iran until the late 1960s and one of its former capitals and residence of the crown prince under the [[Qajar]] dynasty. The city has proven extremely influential in the country’s recent history.

The fifth major city is [[Karaj]] (population 1,377,450), located in [[Alborz province]] and situated 20&nbsp;km west of Tehran, at the foot of the [[Alborz]] mountains; however, the city is increasingly becoming an extension of metropolitan Tehran.

The sixth major Iranian city is [[Shiraz]] (population 1,214,808); it is the capital of [[Fars Province]]. The [[Elamite]] civilization to the west greatly influenced the area, which soon came to be known as [[Persis]]. The ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] were present in the region from about the 9th century BC, and became rulers of a large empire under the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] in the 6th century BC. The ruins of [[Persepolis]] and [[Pasargadae]], two of the four capitals of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], are located in or near [[Shiraz]]. Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and is situated {{nowrap|70 km}} northeast of modern Shiraz. [[UNESCO]] declared the citadel of Persepolis a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979.

===Early history (3200&nbsp;BC – 625&nbsp;BC)===
{{Main|Tappeh Sialk|Jiroft civilization|Elamite kingdom|Mannaeans}}

[[File:Mappa di Eratostene.jpg|thumb|19th century reconstruction of a map of the world by [[Eratosthenes]], [[Circa|c.]]200 BC. The name Ariana (Aryânâ) was used to describe the region where the [[Iranian Plateau]] is found.]]

Elam was part of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urbanization]] during the [[Chalcolithic]]. The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Mesopotamian history. In the Old Elamite period ([[Middle Bronze Age]]), from around 2800 BC, Elam consisted of kingdoms on the [[Iranian plateau]], centered in [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]], and from the mid-[[2nd millennium BC]], it was centered in [[Susa]] in the [[Khuzestan]] lowlands. [[Elamite kingdom]] continued its existence until the emergence of [[Median Empire|Median]] and [[Achaemenid Empire]]s.

[[Proto-Iranian]]s first emerged following the separation of [[Indo-Iranians]], and are traced to the [[Andronovo culture]].<ref name="Panshin">[http://www.panshin.com/trogholm/wonder/indoeuropean/indoeuropean3.html "The Palaeolithic Indo-Europeans"]—Panshin.com. Retrieved 4 June 2006.</ref> ([[Ancient Iranian peoples|Proto-Iranian]]) tribes arrived in the [[Iranian plateau]] in the third and second [[millennium]]&nbsp;BC, probably in more than one wave of emigration, and settled as nomads.

Further separation of Proto-Iranians into "Eastern" and "Western" groups occurred due to migration. By the first millennium BC, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Bactria]]ns and [[Parthia]]ns populated the western part, while [[Cimmerians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Alans]] populated the steppes north of the [[Black Sea]].

Other tribes began to settle on the eastern edge, as far as on the mountainous frontier of the north-western [[Indian subcontinent]] and into the area which is now [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]]. Others, such as the [[Scythia]]n tribes, spread as far west as the [[Balkans]] and as far east as [[Xinjiang]]. [[Avestan]] is an eastern Old [[Iranian language]] that was used to compose the sacred hymns and canon of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Gathas]] in c. 1000 BC.

After Cyrus' death, his son [[Cambyses]] continued his father's work of conquest, making significant gains in Egypt.

Following a power struggle after Cambyses' death, [[Darius I]] was declared king (ruled 522–486&nbsp;BC). Under [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Darius the Great]], the Persian Empire eventually became the largest and most powerful empire in human history up until that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/PERSIANS.HTM|title=The Persians|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> The borders of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]] stretched from the [[Indus]] and [[Oxus]] Rivers in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, extending through [[Anatolia]] (modern day Turkey) and Egypt.

In 499 BC, Athens lent support to a revolt in [[Miletus]] which resulted in the sacking of [[Sardis]]. This led to an Achaemenid campaign against Greece known as the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] which continued through the first half of the 5th century BC. During the [[Greco-Persian wars]] Persia made some major advances and razed Athens in 480 BC, but after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw. Fighting ended with the [[peace of Callias]] in 449 BC.

The rules and ethics emanating from [[Zoroaster]]'s teachings were strictly followed by the Achaemenids who introduced and adopted policies based on [[human rights]], [[equality before the law|equality]] and banning of [[slavery]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Zoroastrianism spread unimposed during the time of the Achaemenids and through contacts with the exiled [[Jewish]] people in [[Babylon]] freed by Cyrus, Zoroastrian concepts further propagated and influenced the [[Abrahamic religions]]. The [[Golden Age of Athens]] marked by [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] also came about during the Achaemenid period while their contacts with Persia and the Near East abounded. The peace, tranquility, security and prosperity that were afforded to the people of the [[Near East]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] proved to be a rare historical occurrence, an unparalleled period where commerce prospered and the standard of living for all people of the region improved.<ref name="vohuman">[http://www.vohuman.org/Article/Historical%20perspective%20on%20Zoroastrianism.htm Vohuman.org], "Historical perspective on Zoroastrianism", Reproduced from Âtaš-è Dorün — The Fire Within, Jamshid Soroush Soroushian Memorial Volume II, 1st Books Library, Bloomington, IN, 2003.

In 334 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid Emperor [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Issus]] in 333 BC. He left the annexed territory in 328–327. In each of the former Achaemenid territories he installed his own officers as caretakers, which led to friction and ultimately to the [[Partition of Babylon|partitioning of the former empire]] after Alexander's death, and the subsequent formation of the [[Seleucid Empire]].

[[File:Parthian Queen Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|120px|A bust from the [[National Museum of Iran]] of [[Queen Musa]]]]

The Parthian Empire (238 BC–226 AD), led by the Arsacid Dynasty, was the third [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian]] kingdom to dominate the Iranian plateau, after defeating the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and intermittently controlled [[Mesopotamia]] between ca. 150&nbsp;BC and 224&nbsp;AD. This was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran and lasted five centuries.
After the conquests of [[Medes|Media]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]], the Parthians had to organize their empire. The former elites of these countries were [[Greeks|Greek]], and the new rulers had to adapt to their customs if they wanted their rule to last. As a result, the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed.

Parthia was the arch-enemy of the [[Roman Empire]] in the east, limiting Rome's expansion beyond [[Cappadocia]] (central [[Anatolia]]). By using a heavily armed and armoured [[cataphract]] cavalry, and lightly armed but highly mobile [[Horse archer|mounted archers]], the Parthians "held their own against Rome for almost 300 years".<ref>''Persians: Masters of Empire'', 1995, ISBN 0-8094-9104-4, p.142–143, Time-life Books</ref> Rome's acclaimed general [[Mark Antony]] led a disastrous campaign against the Parthians in 36 BC, in which he lost 32,000 men. By the time of Roman emperor [[Augustus]], Rome and Parthia were settling some of their differences through diplomacy. By this time, Parthia had acquired an assortment of golden eagles, the cherished [[Aquila (Roman)|standards of Rome's legions]], captured from Mark Antony, and [[Crassus]], who was defeated by General [[Surena]] in the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC.<ref>Cotterell, Arthur.

[[File:Persepolis The Persian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Persian and Median soldiers at [[Persepolis]]]]

The end of the Parthian Empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by Ardashir I, one of the empire's vassals. Ardashir I then went on to create the Sassanid Empire. Soon he started reforming the country both economically and militarily. The Sassanids established an empire roughly within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids, referring to it as ''Erânshahr'' or ''Iranshahr'', ''[[File:Eranshahr.svg|60px]]'', "Dominion of the Iranians", (i.e. of [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]]), with their capital at [[Ctesiphon]].<ref>Garthwaite, Gene R., ''The Persians'', p. 2, ISBN 1-4051-5680-5, Wiley-Blackwell (2006)</ref> Unlike the [[diadochi]]c Seleucids and the succeeding Arsacids, who used a [[vassal state|vassalary system]], the Sassanids—like the Achaemenids—had a system of governors (MP: ''shahrab'') personally appointed by the Emperor and directed by the central government.

In 632 raiders from the Arab peninsula began attacking the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Iran was defeated in the [[Battle of al-Qâdisiyah]], paving way for the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]].

During the Parthian and later [[Sassanid]] eras, trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], Persia, [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world.

Many provinces in Iran defended themselves against the Arab invaders, although none in the end were able to repulse the invaders. However, when the Arabs had subdued the country, many of the cities rose in rebellions, killing Arab governors, although reinforcement by Arab armies succeeded in putting down the rebellions.

However, the Iranians' conversion to Islam was a complex process and is generally considered to have been gradual; the notion of force has largely been discredited,<ref>"Conversion: Of Iranians to Islam." by Elton L.

He then killed all their [[Zoroastrian]] priests and burned and wasted their books, until gradually only the illiterate remained, who knew nothing of writing, and hence the regions history was mostly forgotten.}}</ref>

By the 9th century, Islam became a dominant religion in Persia and the conversion of Iranians to Islam brought profound changes to their life and culture.<ref name="Ehsan"/> However, in some regions, such as the Fars province, Zoroastrianism remained strong up to the 9th century, although [[Sufis]] such as Abu Eshaq Kazeruni, the founder of Kazeruni Sufi order, brought mass conversion of Zoroastrians to Islam in the 10th century.<ref name="Ehsan"/>

The [[Abbasid]] caliphs frequently chose their Iranians as their "[[Vizier|wazirs]]" (viziers), and Iranian governors acquired a certain amount of local autonomy. Thus in 822, the governor of Khorasan, [[Tahir II of Khorasan|Tahir]], proclaimed his independence and founded a new Persian dynasty of [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]]. And by the [[Samanid]] era, Iran's efforts to regain its independence had been well solidified.<ref>Bosworth C. E., Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 4, p. 90.</ref>

Attempts at [[Arabization]] thus never succeeded in Iran, and movements such as the [[Shuubiyah]] became catalysts for Iranians to regain their independence in their relations with the Arab invaders.<ref>C.E. Bosworth, "Ajam" in Encyclopedia Iranica: ''But by the 3rd/9th century, the non-Arabs, and above all the Persians, were asserting their social and cultural equality (taswīa) with the Arabs, if not their superiority (tafżīl) over them (a process seen in the literary movement of the Šoʿūbīya). In any case, there was always in some minds a current of admiration for the ʿAǰam as heirs of an ancient, cultured tradition of life''.</ref> Other notable major revolts, some by Iranian Muslims and others by practitioners of old Iranian religions against Arab rule were led by [[Al-Muqanna]], [[Sunpadh]], [[Khurramites]], [[Babak Khorramdin]], [[Maziar]], [[Mardavij]], [[Ustadh Sis]] and [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari]].

The cultural revival of the post-[[Abbasid]] period led to a resurfacing of Iranian national identity. The resulting cultural movement reached its peak during the 9th and 10th centuries. The most notable effect of the movement was the continuation of the [[Persian language]], the official language of Iran to the present day. [[Ferdowsi]], Iran's greatest epic poet, is regarded today as the most important figure in maintaining the Persian language. After an interval of silence Iran re-emerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam.

Iran was gradually Islamized after the collapse of the [[Sassanid empire]]; however, it was not Arabized. Iranian culture re-emerged with a separate and distinctive character and made an immense contribution to the Islamic civilization.<ref name="LewisIranHistory">Bernard Lewis, "Iran in History", [http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.pdf TAU.ac.il] excerpt: "Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized.

The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India.

In fact, the Muslim world itself, without necessarily putting this judgment in analytical terms, has long since come to accept Islamic civilization as 'Perso-Islamic synthesis'.</ref> When Islam came through Iran, what developed was an Iranian Islam or Persian Islam rather than the original Arab Islam, and this new Islam is sometimes referred to by scholars as Islam-i Ajam (Persian Islam).<ref name="LewisIranHistory"/><ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Mehdi Amin Razavi,"The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia", RoutledgeCurzon; annotated edition edition (4 July 1996). p. 157: "The appearance of the school of Ishraq meant both the guarantee of the propagation of Islamic philosophy in a form that was clearer to the heart of Islam than the earlier schools of thoughts, and also the creation of a school that was particularly close to the ethos of Persian Islam and spread wherever Persian Islamic culture was dominant.</ref>

It was this Persian Islam and Sufism which was brought to new areas and new peoples such as the Turks of Central Asia, the Ottoman Empire, and the Indian subcontinent.<ref name="LewisIranHistory"/> Among the major [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] Muslims who cultivated [[Sufism]] and helped the spread of [[Islam]] through Sufism, one can mention Habib Ajami, [[Hallaj]], [[Hasan Basri]], [[Junayd Baghdadi]], [[Bayazid Bistami]], [[Maruf Karkhi]], [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], [[Moinuddin Chishti]], [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], [[Najmuddin Kubra]], and [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]]. Note should also be made of [[Abu Hanifa]], the founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of thought which is followed by most Muslims today.

Arabic writer [[Ibn Khaldun]] has remarked that the sedentary culture which was necessary for the development of civilization was rooted in the Persian empire.<ref name="Franz Rosenthal 1969">The Muqaddimah By Ibn Khaldūn translated by Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood, Published by Princeton University Press, 1969.</ref>

One of the main developments after the advent of Islam in Iran was the rise of the [[Persian language|New Persian language]] as an important [[Indo-European]] language. The New Persian language was an evolution of [[Middle Persian]], which in turn was derived from [[Old Persian]]. New Persian absorbed a considerable amount of Arabic vocabulary<ref>Professor. Gilbert Lazard: ''The language known as New Persian, which usually is called at this period (early Islamic times) by the name of Dari or Parsi-Dari, can be classified linguistically as a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of Sassanian Iran, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids. Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as [[Avestan]], [[Parthia]]n, [[Soghdian]], [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Pashto]], etc., Old [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and New Persian represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in [[Fars Province|Fars]] (the true Persian country from the historical point of view) and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran'' in (Lazard, Gilbert 1975, “The Rise of the New Persian Language” in Frye, R.

In terms of contribution to the Arabic language, Iranians like Sibawayhi<ref>M. G.

Even in the development of Arabic scientific prose itself, which differs in style from that of the [[Quran]], Persian scholars such as [[Ibn al-Muqaffa]] had a major role. Indeed, the class of clerks and civil administrators that was responsible for the cultivation of the sciences in the early Islamic centuries consisted mostly of Persians.<ref>William Bayne Fisher, et al., ''The Cambridge History of Iran 4'' Published by Cambridge University Press, 1975, ISBN 0-521-20093-8, p. 397.</ref> The contributions of Iranians to the Arabic language are however not limited to scientific prose but are also found in Arabic poetry.

''A Literary History of the Arabs'', Published by Routledge, 1995, ISBN 0-7007-0336-5, p. 290.</ref>

[[Iranian philosophy]] after the Islamic conquest is characterized by different interactions with Old Iranian philosophy, with [[Greek philosophy]], and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of this era in Persia. These movements continued well into the 11th century, during which the [[Nizamiyya]] University was founded, and [[List of Iranian scientists and scholars|hundreds of Iranian scholars and scientists]] contributed greatly to technology, science, and medicine, later influencing the rise of European sciences during [[the Renaissance]].<ref>Kühnel E., in ''Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesell'', Vol. CVI (1956).</ref>

[[File:Сефи 1й 1629-42.jpg|thumb|upright|130px|[[Shah Ismail I]], the founder of the [[Safavid Dynasty]] (1501–1736)]]
Iran's first encompassing [[Shi'a Islam]]ic state was established under the [[Safavid Dynasty]] (1501–1722) by [[Shah Ismail I]]. The Safavid dynasty soon became a major political power and promoted the flow of bilateral state contacts. The Safavid peak was during the rule of [[Shah Abbas I|Shah Abbas The Great]].<ref name="islamic1600">[http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/safavid/abbas.html "The Islamic World to 1600", The Applied History Research Group, The University of Calgary, 1998]. Retrieved 1 October 2007.</ref> The [[Safavid Dynasty]] frequently warred with the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] tribes and the [[Portuguese Empire]].

The Safavids moved their capital from [[Tabriz]] to [[Qazvin]] and then to [[Isfahan]], where their patronage for the arts propelled Iran into one of its most aesthetically productive eras. Under their rule, the state became highly centralized, the first attempts to modernize the military were made, and even [[Isfahani style (Iranian architecture)|a distinct style of architecture developed]]. In 1722 [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] rebels headed by the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotakis]] of [[Kandahar]] defeated [[Husayn (Safavid)|Shah Sultan Hossein]] and ended the Safavid Dynasty, but in 1735, [[Nader Shah]] successfully drove out the Pashtuns from Isfahan and established the [[Afsharid Dynasty]].
[[File:Sattar Khan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|130px|[[Sattar Khan]] was a key figure in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]]]
He then staged an incursion into India in 1738, securing the [[Peacock throne]], [[Koh-i-Noor]], and [[Darya-ye Noor]] among other [[Royal family|royal]] treasures. His rule did not last long, however, as he was assassinated in 1747. The [[Mashhad]] based Afshar Dynasty was succeeded by the [[Zand dynasty]] in 1750, founded by [[Karim Khan]], who established his capital at [[Shiraz]]. His rule brought a period of relative peace and renewed prosperity.

The Zand dynasty lasted three generations, until [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Aga Muhammad Khan]] executed [[Lotf Ali Khan]], and founded his new capital in [[Tehran]], marking the dawn of the [[Qajar|Qajar Dynasty]] in 1794. The [[Qajar]] chancellor [[Amir Kabir]] established [[Dar ul-Funun|Iran's first modern college]] system, among other modernizing reforms. Iran suffered [[Russo-Persian Wars (disambiguation)|several wars with Imperial Russia]] during the [[Qajar]] era, resulting in Iran losing almost half of its territories to [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[British Empire]], via the treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Gulistan]], [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]] and [[Treaty of Akhal|Akhal]]. The Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871 is believed to have caused the death of 2 million persons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0041-977X%281986%2949%3A1%3C183%3ATGPFO1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage |title=The Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871 |publisher=Links.jstor.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>

In spite of [[The Great Game]] Iran managed to maintain her sovereignty and was never colonized, unlike neighbouring states in the region. Repeated foreign intervention and a corrupt and weakened Qajar rule led to [[Tobacco Protest|various protests]] and [[Attempts at Constitutionalization in Iran|constitutionalization efforts]] which eventually resulted in the establishment of [[Majles|the nation's first parliament]] in 1906.

[[File:Dr.Mohammad Mosaddeq.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]]]] 
In 1925, [[Reza Shah|Reza Khan]] overthrew the weakening [[Qajar Dynasty]] and became [[Shah]]. Reza Shah initiated [[industrialization]], [[Rail transport|railroad]] construction, and the establishment of a national [[Higher education in Iran|education]] system. Reza Shah sought to balance Russian and British influence, but when [[World War II]] started, his nascent ties to Germany alarmed Britain and Russia. In 1941, [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Britain and the USSR invaded Iran]] to use Iranian railroad capacity during [[World War II]]. The Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].

In 1951, after the assassination of prime minister [[Ali Razmara]], Dr. [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] was elected [[Prime Minister of Iran|prime minister]] by a parliamentary vote which was then ratified by the Shah. As prime minister, Mossadegh became enormously popular in Iran after he [[nationalize]]d [[Petroleum industry in Iran|Iran's petroleum industry]] and oil reserves. In response, the British government, headed by [[Winston Churchill]], embargoed Iranian oil and successfully enlisted the United States to join in a plot to depose the democratically [[election|elected]] government of Mossadegh. In 1953 US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] authorized [[Operation Ajax]]. The operation was successful, and Mossadegh was arrested on 19 August 1953. The coup was the first time the US had openly overthrown an elected, civilian government.<ref>[[Stephen Kinzer]]: ''[[All the Shah's Men]].

[[File:Shah Farah.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and [[Farah Pahlavi|Empress Farah]] in official uniform]]
After Operation Ajax, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became increasingly [[autocracy|autocratic]]. With American support, the Shah was able to rapidly modernize Iranian infrastructure, but he simultaneously crushed all forms of political opposition with his intelligence agency, [[SAVAK]]. [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] became an active critic of the Shah's [[White Revolution]] and publicly denounced the government.

Khomeini was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964 Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government. The Shah was persuaded to send him into exile by General [[Hassan Pakravan]]. Khomeini was sent first to [[Turkey]], then to [[Iraq]] and finally to France. While in exile, he continued to denounce the Shah.

The [[Pahlavi Dynasty]] collapsed ten days later, on 11 February, when Iran's military declared itself "neutral" after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979, when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so.<ref name="britannica1"/><ref name="Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981 Encyclopædia Britannica] 23 January 2008</ref>

In December 1979, the country approved a [[theocratic]] constitution, whereby Khomeini became [[Supreme Leader]] of the country.
The speed and success of the revolution surprised many throughout the world,<ref>Jahangir Amuzegar, ''The Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution,'' (1991), p.4, 9–12 ISBN 0-7914-0731-4</ref> as it had not been precipitated by a military defeat, a financial crisis, or a peasant rebellion.<ref>Arjomand, ''Turban'' (1988), p. 191.</ref> Although both nationalists and Marxists joined with Islamic traditionalists to overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were killed and executed by the Islamic regime afterward, and the revolution ultimately resulted in an Islamic Republic under [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]].<ref name="Benard">Cheryl Benard, Zalmay Khalilzad, ''"The Government of God"'' ISBN 0-231-05376-2, Columbia University Press (1984), p. 18.</ref>
[[File:تصویر خمینی.jpg|thumb|110px|left|[[Ayatollah]] [[Khomeini]], founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran]]
Iran's [[US-Iran relations|relationship with the United States]] deteriorated rapidly during the revolution. On 4 November 1979, a group of Iranian students [[Iran hostage crisis|seized US embassy personnel]], labeling the embassy a "den of spies".<ref name="carterpbs">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/sfeature/sf_hostage.html PBS, American Experience, Jimmy Carter, "444 Days: America Reacts"]. Retrieved 1 October 2007.</ref> They accused its personnel of being CIA agents plotting to overthrow the revolutionary government, as the CIA had done to [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] in 1953. While the student ringleaders had not asked for permission from [[Khomeini]] to seize the embassy, [[Khomeini]] nonetheless supported the embassy takeover after hearing of its success.<ref name="MarkBowden-Guests">Guests of the Ayatollah: The Iran Hostage Crisis: The First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam, Mark Bowden, p. 127 ISBN 0-8021-4303-2, Grove Press</ref>

While most of the [[female]] and [[African American]] hostages were released within the first months,<ref name="MarkBowden-Guests"/> the remaining 52 hostages were held for 444 days. Subsequent attempts by the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration to negotiate or [[Operation Eagle Claw|rescue]] were unsuccessful. In January 1981 the hostages were set free according to the [[Algiers declaration]].

Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to take advantage of what he perceived to be disorder in the wake of the Iranian Revolution and its unpopularity with Western governments. The once-strong [[Iranian military]] had been disbanded during the revolution. Saddam sought to expand Iraq's access to the [[Persian Gulf]] by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule. Of chief importance to Iraq was [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] which not only has a substantial [[Arab]] population, but boasted rich oil fields as well. On the unilateral behalf of the [[United Arab Emirates]], the islands of [[Abu Musa]] and the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] became objectives as well. On 22 September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Although Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, by 1982, Iranian forces managed to push the Iraqi army back into Iraq. Khomeini sought to [[Export of revolution|export his Islamic revolution]] westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be anywhere between 500,000 and 1,000,000; with more than 100,000 Iranians being victims of Iraq's chemical weapons.<ref name="r1">Centre for Documents of The Imposed War, Tehran.

The U.S. Department of Defense publication, ''Proliferation: Threat and Response'', 25 November 1997 confirms Iran began a CW program in 1983 producing  nerve gas, phosgene gas and cyanotic agents and had purchased mustard gas. The DoD reported that Iran "employed CW agents on a small scale between 1984 and 1988". A March, 1990 a U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] report stated that a United Nations team had examined Iraqi victims of Iranian chemical attacks who "displayed the effects of exposure to a choking agent believed to have been phosgene." -->

Following the Iran–Iraq War President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution. Rafsanjani served until 1997 when he was succeeded by the moderate [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] [[Mohammad Khatami]]. During his two terms as president, Khatami advocated [[freedom of expression]], tolerance and [[civil society]], constructive diplomatic relations with other states including [[EU]] and [[Asia]]n governments, and an economic policy that supported [[free market]] and foreign investment. However, Khatami is widely regarded as having been unsuccessful in achieving his goal of making Iran more free and democratic.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{Cite news|author=Dan De Luce in Tehran |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/may/04/iran |title=The Guardian, Tuesday 4 May 2004, Khatami blames clerics for failure |publisher=Guardian |date= 4 May 2004|accessdate=2010-08-25 | location=London}}</ref> In the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]], Iran made yet another change in political direction, when conservative populist candidate [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected over [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]].<ref>

[[File:Ali Khamenei,.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Ali Khamenei]], Supreme Leader of Iran.]]

The political system of the Islamic [[Republic]] is based on the 1979 [[Iranian Constitution|Constitution]]. Accordingly, it is the duty of the [[Government of Iran|Islamic government]] to furnish all citizens with equal and appropriate opportunities, to provide them with work, and to satisfy their essential needs, so that the course of their progress may be assured.<ref>[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/ir00000_.html University of Bern; Iranian Constitution summary]. Retrieved 30 November 2009. {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The system comprises several intricately connected governing bodies. [[Supreme Leader of Iran|The Leader of the Revolution]] (commonly called "Supreme Leader" in the USA and the UK) is responsible for [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|delineation and supervision]] of the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.<ref name="leader">[http://www.leader.ir/langs/en/index.php?p=leader_law Leader.ir], retrieved 13 May 2008</ref> The Supreme Leader is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations; and has sole power to declare war or peace.<ref name="leader"/>

The heads of the judiciary, state radio and television networks, the commanders of the police and military forces and six of the twelve members of the [[Council of Guardians]] are appointed by the Supreme Leader.<ref name="leader"/> The [[Assembly of Experts]] elects and dismisses the Supreme Leader on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem.<ref name="loc">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/iran/81.htm|title=Iran — The Constitution|first=Library of Congress|last=Federal Research Division|accessdate=2006-04-14}}</ref> The Assembly of Experts is responsible for supervising the Supreme Leader in the performance of legal duties.

Unlike many other states, the executive branch in Iran does not control the armed forces. Although the President appoints the Ministers of Intelligence and Defense, it is customary for the President to obtain explicit approval from the Supreme Leader for these two ministers before presenting them to the legislature for a vote of confidence. Iran's current president, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], was first elected in a run-off poll in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]] and re-elected in the [[2009 Iranian presidential election|2009 presidential elections]].

[[City and Village Councils of Iran|Local City Councils]] are elected by public vote to four-year terms in all cities and villages of Iran.

This section of the constitution was not implemented until 1999 when the first local council elections were held across the country. Councils have many different responsibilities including electing mayors, supervising the activities of municipalities; studying, planning, co-ordinating and implementing of social, cultural, educational, health, economic, and welfare requirements of their constituencies.

In 2004, a large share of [[Natural gas reserves in Iran|Iran's natural gas reserves]] were untapped. The addition of new [[hydroelectric]] stations and the streamlining of conventional [[coal]] and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts.

[[Demographics of Iran|Demographic]] trends and intensified industrialization have caused [[electric power]] demand to grow by 8% per year.

The Culture of Iran is a mix of ancient pre-Islamic culture and Islamic culture. Iranian culture has long been a predominant culture of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]], with Persian considered the language of intellectuals during much of the 2nd millennium, and the language of religion and the populace before that.

The [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid era]] was an important and influential historical period in Iran as Iranian culture influenced China, India and Roman civilization considerably,<ref>J. B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire: From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Volume 1, p.109 ISBN 0-486-20398-0, Dover Publications</ref> and so influenced as far as Western Europe and Africa.<ref>[http://www.transoxiana.com.ar/0104/sasanians.html Transoxiana 04: Sassanids in Africa].

After [[Islamization in Iran|Islamization of Iran]] Islamic rituals have penetrated in the Iranian culture. The most noticeable one of them is [[commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali]]. Every year in [[Day of Ashura]] most of Iranians, including [[Armenians]] and [[Zoroastrians]] participate in mourning for the martyrs of [[battle of Karbala]]. Daily life in modern Iran is closely interwoven with [[Shia Islam]] and the country's art, literature, and architecture are an ever-present reminder of its deep national tradition and of a broader literary culture.<ref name="Iran in Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Afary|first=Janet|title=Iran|year=2006|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica Online|accessdate=2007-10-29|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106324/Iran}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tebyan.net/Literature_Art/GodlyPeople/Occasions/2005/2/22/10530.html گزارش عزاداری ، ارامنه و زرتشتیان ایران]</ref>

===Language and literature===

[[File:Moderniranianlanguagesmap.jpg|thumb|300px|Geographic distribution of the Modern Iranian languages: Persian (green), Pashto (purple) and Kurdish (turquoise), Lurish (red), Baloch (Yellow), as well as smaller communities of other Iranian languages]]

Article 15 of the Iranian constitution states that the "Official language (of Iran)... is Persian...[and]... the use of regional and tribal languages in the press and mass media, as well as for teaching of their literature in schools, is allowed in addition to Persian." Persian serves as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in Iran and most publications and broadcastings are in this language.

Next to Persian, there are many publications and broadcastings in other relatively popular languages of Iran such as Azeri, Kurdish and even in less popular ones such as Arabic and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Many languages originated in Iran, but Persian is the most used language. Persian belongs to [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages. The oldest records in [[Old Persian]] date to the [[Achaemenid Empire]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Languages of the World|year=2002|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|publisher=Routledge|page=163|isbn=0415250048}}</ref> and examples of Old Persian have been found in present-day Iran, Iraq, [[Turkey]] and [[Egypt]].

In the late 8th century, Persian was highly Arabized and written in a [[Perso-Arabic script|modified Arabic script]]. This caused a movement supporting the revival of Persian. An important event of this revival was the writing of the ''[[Shahname]]'' by [[Ferdowsi]] (Persian: ''Epic of Kings''), Iran's national epic, which is said to have been written entirely in native Persian. This gave rise to a strong reassertion of Iranian national identity, and is in part credited for the continued existence of Persian as a separate language.

''{{cquote|<center>بسی رنج بردم در این سال سی <br/>عجم زنده کردم بدین پارسی</center>''For thirty years, I suffered much pain and strife<br/>with Persian I gave the [[Ajam]] verve and life''}}<center>''—[[Ferdowsi]]'' (935–1020)</center>''

[[File:Kelileh va Demneh.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Kelileh va Demneh]] Persian manuscript copy dated 1429]]

Persian beside Arabic has been a medium for literary and scientific contributions to the [[Islamic world]] especially in [[Anatolia]], [[central Asia]] and [[Indian sub-continent]]. Poetry is a very important part of Persian culture. Poetry is used in many Persian classical works, whether from literature, science, or metaphysics. Persian literature has been considered by such thinkers as [[Goethe]] as one of the four main bodies of world literature.<ref>Von David Levinson, Karen Christensen, Encyclopedia of Modern Asia, Charles Scribner's Sons. 2002 pg 48</ref>

The Persian language has produced a number of famous poets; however, only a few poets as [[Rumi]] and [[Omar Khayyám]] have surfaced among western popular readership, even though the likes of [[Hafez]], [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Nezami]]<ref>C. A. (Charles Ambrose) Storey and Franço de Blois (2004), “Persian Literature – A Biobibliographical Survey: Volume V Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period.”, RoutledgeCurzon; 2nd revised edition (21 June 2004). ISBN 0-947593-47-0. Pg 363: “Nizami Ganja’i, whose personal name was Ilyas, is the most celebrated native poet of the Persians after Firdausi. His nisbah designates him as a native of Ganja (Elizavetpol, Kirovabad) in Azerbaijan, then still a country with an Iranian population</ref> [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]], [[Sanai]], [[Naser Khusraw]], [[Jami]] are considered by many Iranians to be just as influential. The books of famous poets have been translated into western languages since 1634. An example of Persian poetic influence is the poem below which is widely popular:

[[Iranian philosophy]] after the acceptance of [[Islam in Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Iranian philosophy#Ancient Iranian Philosophy|Ancient Iranian Philosophy]], the [[Greek Philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic Philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia. Important contributors to philosophy in Iran are [[Zoroaster]], [[Jamasp]], [[Iranshahri]], [[Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Suhrawardi]], [[Nasir Khusraw]], [[Biruni]], [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]], [[Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani]], [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]], [[Qutb al-Din Shirazi]], [[Mir Damad]], [[Mulla Sadra]], [[Mir Fendereski]] and [[Hadi Sabzevari]].

The musical culture of Persia, while distinct, is closely related to other musical systems of the Middle East and Central Asia. It has also affinities to the music cultures of the Indian subcontinent, to a certain degree even to those of Africa, and, in the period after 1800 particularly, to that of Europe. Its history can be traced to some extent through these relationships. Like that of most of the world’s cultures, the music of Persia has depended on oral/aural transmission and learning.<ref>Bruno Nettl, "Iran: Music" in Encyclopaedia Iranica.

{{Main|Iranian Cinema}}
[[Iranian cinema]] has thrived in modern Iran, and many Iranian directors have garnered worldwide recognition for their work. Iranian movies have won over three hundred awards in the past twenty-five years. One of the best-known directors is [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. The [[media of Iran]] is a mixture of private and state-owned, but books and movies must be approved by the [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance]] before being released to the public. The [[Internet]] has become enormously popular among the Iranian youth.

{{Main|Iranian architecture|Iranian art}}

[[Greater Iran]] is home to one of the richest [[art]]istic traditions in world history and encompasses many disciplines, including [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[calligraphy]], [[metalworking]] and [[stone masonry]]. Carpet-weaving is one of the most distinguished manifestations of Persian culture and art, and dates back to ancient Persia. Persians were among the first to use [[mathematics]], [[geometry]], and [[astronomy]] in architecture and also have extraordinary skills in making massive domes which can be seen frequently in the structure of bazaars and mosques. The main building types of classical [[Iranian architecture]] are the [[mosque]] and the [[palace]]. Besides being home to a large number of art houses and galleries, Iran also holds one of the [[Iranian Crown Jewels|largest and most valuable jewel collections]] in the world.

Iran ranks seventh among countries in the world with the most archeological architectural ruins and attractions from antiquity as recognized by [[UNESCO]].<ref>[http://www.american.edu/ted/iran-tour.htm Bustling bazaars and ancient sights, parched deserts and snowcapped mountains, awesome architecture and simple hospitality].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Iran}}
The [[cuisine of Iran]] is diverse, with each province featuring dishes, as well as culinary traditions and styles, distinct to their regions. The main Persian cuisines are combinations of rice with meat, chicken or fish and some onion, vegetables, nuts, and herbs. Herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plums, pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. Iranians also usually eat plain [[yogurt]] ({{lang-fa|ماست, māst}}) with lunch and dinner; it is a staple of the diet in Iran. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavourings such as saffron, dried limes, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form. Iran is also famous for its [[caviar]].<ref>[http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2228/html/focus.htm Iran-daily.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> Iranian food is not spicy.
