The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is one of the four [[big cat]]s in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]'', and a member of the family [[Felidae]]. With some males exceeding 250&nbsp;kg (550&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) in weight,<ref name = "nowak"/> it is the second-largest living cat after the [[tiger]]. Wild lions currently exist in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and in [[Asia]] with an [[endangered]] remnant population in [[Gir Forest National Park]] in [[India]], having disappeared from [[North Africa]] and [[Southwest Asia]] in historic times. Until the late [[Pleistocene]], about 10,000&nbsp;years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the [[Yukon]] to [[Peru]].<ref name=Harington69/> The lion is a [[vulnerable species]], having seen a possibly irreversible population decline of thirty to fifty percent over the past two decades in its African range.<ref name=IUCN>{{IUCN2006|assessors=Nowell & Bauer|year=2004|id=15951|title=Panthera leo|downloaded=11 May 2006}} Database entry includes a lengthy justification of why this species is vulnerable.</ref> Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern.

Lions live for ten to fourteen years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than twenty years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than ten years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smuts |first=G.L. |year=1982 |title=Lion|publisher=Macmillian South Africa (Publishers)(Pty.) Ltd.|location=Johannesburg |page=231|isbn= 0-86954-122-6}}</ref> They typically inhabit [[savanna]] and [[grassland]], although they may take to bush and [[forest]]. Lions are unusually [[social animal|social]] compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. Lions are [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone species#Predators|keystone]] predators, although they scavenge as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so.

Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognized by its [[Lion#Mane|mane]], and its face is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols in human [[culture]]. Depictions have existed from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, with carvings and paintings from the [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave]]s, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in [[sculpture]]s, in [[painting]]s, on national [[flag]]s, and in contemporary [[film]]s and [[literature]]. Lions have been kept in [[menagerie]]s since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]] and have been a key species sought for exhibition in [[zoo]]s the world over since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered [[Asiatic Lion|Asiatic subspecies]].

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The lion is a species of the genus ''[[Panthera]]'' and its closest relatives are the other species of this genus: the [[tiger]], the [[jaguar]], and the [[leopard]]. ''Panthera leo'' itself evolved in [[Africa]] between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the [[Holarctic]] region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Yamaguchi |first=Nobuyuki| coauthors=Alan Cooper, Lars Werdelin and David W.

From this lion derived the later Cave Lion (''[[Panthera leo spelaea]]''), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. During the upper [[Pleistocene]] the lion spread to North and South America, and developed into ''Panthera leo atrox'', the [[American Lion]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Turner |first=Allen |year=1997 |title=The big cats and their fossil relatives : an illustrated guide to their evolution and natural history |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-10229-1 |pages=}}</ref> Lions died out in northern [[Eurasia]] and America at the end of the last [[glacier|glaciation]], about 10,000 years ago;<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny"/> this may have been secondary to the [[Pleistocene extinctions|extinction]] of [[Pleistocene megafauna]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Harington | first = C.R. | title = American Lion | work = Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre website | publisher = Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre | year = 1996 | url =http://www.beringia.com/research/lion.html | accessdate = 25 January 2011}}</ref>

===Subspecies===
Traditionally, twelve recent [[subspecies]] of lion were recognized, distinguished by mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Grisham |first=Jack |editor=Catherine E. Bell |title=Lion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos |volume=2: G–P |year=2001 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |location=Chofago |isbn=1-57958-174-9 |pages=733–39}}</ref> Today only eight subspecies are usually accepted,<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny">{{Cite journal|author=Burger, Joachim ''et al.'' |month=March |year=2004 |title=Molecular phylogeny of the extinct cave lion ''Panthera leo spelaea'' |journal=[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] |pmid=15012963 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=841–849 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.020| url= http://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Biologie/Anthropologie/MolA/Download/Burger%202004.pdf (fulltext)| accessdate=20 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" /> although one of these (the [[Cape Lion]], formerly described as ''Panthera leo melanochaita'') probably is invalid.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" />
Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many; [[mitochondria]]l variation in recent African lions is modest, which suggests that all sub-Saharan lions could be considered a single subspecies, possibly divided in two main [[clade]]s: one to the west of the [[Great Rift Valley]] and the other to the east.

====Recent====
Eight recent ([[Holocene]]) subspecies are recognized today:
* ''P. l. persica'', known as the [[Asiatic Lion]] or South Asian, Persian, or Indian Lion, once was widespread from [[Turkey]], across [[Southwest Asia]], to [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and even to [[Bangladesh]]. However, large prides and daylight activity made them easier to poach than tigers or leopards; now around 300 exist in and near the [[Gir Forest National Park|Gir Forest]] of India.<ref name="Asiaticweb">{{cite web| author=Wildlife Conservation Trust of India | title=Asiatic Lion—History | work=Asiatic Lion Information Centre | publisher=Wildlife Conservation Trust of India | year=2006 | url=http://www.asiaticlion.org/asiatic-lion-history.htm | accessdate=15 September 2007}}</ref> Genetic evidence suggests its ancestors split from the ancestors of subsaharan African lions between 74 and 203 thousand years ago.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny"/>

* ''P. l. melanochaita'', known as the [[Cape Lion]], became extinct in the wild around 1860. Results of [[mitochondrial DNA]] research do not support the status as a distinct subspecies. It seems probable that the Cape lion was only the southernmost population of the extant ''P. l. krugeri''.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" />

====Pleistocene====
Several additional subspecies of lion existed in prehistoric times:
<!-- prose form please -->
* ''P. l. atrox'', known as the [[American Lion]] or American cave lion, was abundant in the Americas from [[Canada]] to [[Peru]] in the Pleistocene Epoch until about 10,000 years ago. This form as well as the cave lion sometimes are considered to represent separate species, but recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are in fact, subspecies of the lion (''Panthera leo'').<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /><ref>Barnett, Ross ''et al.''

* ''P. l. fossilis'', known as the [[Panthera leo fossilis|Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion]], flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been recovered from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].

====Dubious====
* ''P. l. sinhaleyus'', known as the [[Sri Lanka Lion]], appears to have become extinct [[circa|approximately]] 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in deposits at [[Kuruwita]]. Based on these teeth, [[Paul E. P. Deraniyagala|P. Deraniyagala]] erected this subspecies in 1939.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kelum Manamendra-Arachchi, Rohan Pethiyagoda, Rajith Dissanayake, Madhava Meegaskumbura |year=2005 |title=A second extinct big cat from the late Quaternary of Sri Lanka. |journal=The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement |volume=12 |pages=423–434 |id= |url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s12/s12rbz423-434.pdf|publisher=National University of Singapore |accessdate= 31 July 2007}}</ref>
* ''P. l. europaea'', known as the [[European Lion]], was probably identical with ''Panthera leo persica'' or ''Panthera leo spelea''; its status as a subspecies is unconfirmed. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and [[over-exploitation]]. It inhabited the [[Balkans]], the [[Italian Peninsula]], southern [[France]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It was a very popular object of hunting among [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]].

*''P. l. maculatus'', known as the [[Marozi]] or Spotted lion, sometimes is believed to be a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly colored individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard-lion [[Panthera hybrid|hybrid]] commonly known as a [[leopon]].<ref name="shuker">{{Cite book| last=Shuker | first=Karl P.N. | authorlink=Karl Shuker | title=Mystery Cats of the World | publisher=Robert Hale | year=1989 | isbn=0-7090-3706-6}}</ref>

===Hybrids===
{{further|[[Panthera hybrid]], [[Liger]], and [[Tiglon|Tigon]]}}

Lions have been known to [[biological reproduction|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often the [[Siberian Tiger|Siberian]] and [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal]] subspecies) to create hybrids<!-- is hybrid the appropriate term, are they infertile? --> called [[liger]]s and [[tiglon]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guggisberg |first=Charles Albert Walter |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=1975 |publisher=Taplinger Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-8008-8324-1 }}</ref> They also have been crossed with [[leopards]] to produce [[leopon]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Doi H, Reynolds B |title=The Story of Leopons |year=1967 |publisher=Putnam |location=New York |oclc=469041 <!--Too old for ISBN-->}}</ref> and [[jaguar]]s to produce [[Panthera hybrid#Jaglion|jaglions]]. The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese Spotted Lion]] is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called a lijagulep. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in [[China]].

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Lion and eland.jpg|thumb|left|A Skeletal Mount of an African Lion Attacking a [[Common Eland]] on Display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]]]

The lion is the tallest (at the shoulder) of the felines, and also is the second-heaviest feline after the [[tiger]]. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.<ref name="USSR">{{Cite book| author = Heptner,  V.G; Sludskii, A.A. | title = Mammals of the Soviet Union, Volume II, Part 2 | year = 1992| pages = | isbn = 9004088768 | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden u.a.}}</ref> Lion coloration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown [[Rosette (zoology)|rosettes]] (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.

Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious [[sexual dimorphism]]—that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialized roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick cumbersome mane. It seems to impede the male's ability to be camouflaged when stalking the prey and create overheating in chases. The color of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older.

[[Image:HansomeLion 002.jpg|thumb|right|During confrontations with others, the mane makes the lion look larger.]]
Weights for adult lions range between 150–250&nbsp;kg (330–550&nbsp;lb) for males and 120–182&nbsp;kg (264–400&nbsp;lb) for females.<ref name="nowak">{{Cite book|last=Nowak |first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> Nowell and Jackson report average weights of 181&nbsp;kg for males and 126&nbsp;kg for females; one male shot near [[Mount Kenya]] was weighed at 272&nbsp;kg (600&nbsp;lb).<ref name="CAP"/> Lions tend to vary in size depending on their environment and area, resulting in a wide spread in recorded weights. For instance, lions in [[southern Africa]] tend to be about 5 percent heavier than those in [[East Africa]], in general.<ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela.

The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5&nbsp;mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail—the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5½&nbsp;months of age and is readily identifiable at 7&nbsp;months.<ref name="Schaller28">Schaller, p. 28</ref>

===Mane===
The mane of the adult male lion, unique among cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It makes the lion appear larger, providing an excellent intimidation display; this aids the lion during confrontations with other lions and with the species' chief competitor in Africa, the [[spotted hyena]].<ref>

Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the [[Barbary Lion]] and [[Cape Lion]]. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the color and size of a lion's mane, such as the [[room temperature|ambient temperature]].<ref name=West/> The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American [[zoo]]s, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity">{{Cite journal|last=Barnett |first=Ross |coauthors=Nobuyuki Yamaguchi, Ian Barnes and Alan Cooper |month=August |year=2006 |title=Lost populations and preserving genetic diversity in the lion ''Panthera leo'': Implications for its ''ex situ'' conservation |journal=Conservation Genetics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=507–514 |doi=10.1007/s10592-005-9062-0}} <!-- url not accessible at the moment http://abc.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Papers/consgen06_lion.pdf--></ref><ref name="yamaguchi-haddane">{{Cite journal|last=Yamaguchi |first=Nobuyuki |coauthors=B.

===White lions===
[[Image:White Lion.jpg|thumb|right|[[White lion]]s owe their coloring to a recessive gene; they are rare forms of the subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri'']]
The [[white lion]] is not a distinct subspecies, but a special [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition, [[leucism]],<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> that causes paler colouration akin to that of the [[white tiger]]; the condition is similar to [[melanism]], which causes [[black panther]]s. They are not albinos, having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White Transvaal lion ''(Panthera leo krugeri)'' individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], where breeders deliberately select them.

==Behavior==
Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20&nbsp;hours per day.<ref name="Schaller122">Schaller, p. 122</ref> Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50&nbsp;minutes eating.<ref name="Schaller120">Schaller, p. 120–121</ref>

===Group organization===
Lions are predatory [[carnivore]]s who manifest two types of social organization. Some are ''residents,'' living in groups, called ''prides''.<ref name="Schaller33">Schaller, p. 33</ref> The pride usually consists of five or six related females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males (known as a ''coalition'' if more than one) who mate with the adult females (although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed). The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two, but may increase to four and decrease again over time. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity.
[[Image:pride leader.jpg|thumb|left|Two lionesses and a mature male of a pride, northern Serengeti]]

The second organizational behaviour is labeled ''nomads'', who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<ref name="Schaller33"/> Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males have to go through this lifestyle and some never are able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related, and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group.

The area a pride occupies is called a ''pride area'', whereas that by a nomad is a ''range''.<ref name="Schaller33"/> The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory. Why [[social behavior|sociality]]—the most pronounced in any cat species—has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita caloric intake, however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]] (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<ref name=CAP/>

[[File:Lion.ogv|thumb|right|Video of a lion in the wild]]
Lionesses do the majority of the hunting for their pride, being smaller, swifter and more agile than the males, and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a co-ordinated group in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully. However, if nearby the hunt, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded. They are more likely to share with the cubs than with the lionesses, but rarely share food they have killed by themselves. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing of larger kills,<ref name="Schaller133">Schaller, p. 133</ref> although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as  each tries to consume as much food as possible.

Both males and females defend the pride against intruders. Some individual lions consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heinsohn|first= R. |coauthors= C.

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:Female Lion.JPG|thumb|upright|While a lioness such as this one has very sharp teeth, prey is usually killed by strangulation]]
Lions are powerful animals that usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina—for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57 percent of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45 percent of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1 percent of its body weight.<ref name="Schaller39">Schaller, p. 248</ref> Thus, they only run fast in short bursts,<ref name="Schaller2478">Schaller, p. 247–248</ref> and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.<ref name="Schaller237">Schaller, p. 237</ref> They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of around 30&nbsp;metres (98&nbsp;ft) or less. Typically, several lionesses work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is killed by [[strangulation]],<ref>{{cite web|title=About lions—Ecology and behaviour |author=Dr Gus Mills |publisher=African Lion Working Group |url=http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm |accessdate=20 July 2007}}</ref> which can cause [[cerebral ischemia]] or [[asphyxia]] (which results in [[hypoxemia|hypoxemic]], or "general", [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws<ref name="nowak">Ronald M. Nowak: ''Walker's Mammals of the World''.</ref> (which would also result in asphyxia). Smaller prey, though, may simply be killed by a swipe of a lion's paw.<ref name="nowak"/>

[[Image:Serengeti Lion Running saturated.jpg|thumb|left|Lioness in a burst of speed while hunting in the Serengeti]]
The [[predation|prey]] consists mainly of large mammals, with a preference for [[wildebeest]], [[impala]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], and [[warthog]]s in Africa and [[nilgai]], [[boar|wild boar]], and several [[deer]] species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability. Mainly this will include [[ungulate]]s weighing between 50 and 300&nbsp;kg (110–660&nbsp;lb) such as [[kudu]], [[hartebeest]], [[gemsbok]], and [[taurotragus|eland]].<ref name="nowak"/> Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as [[Thomson's Gazelle]] or [[springbok (antelope)|springbok]]. Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male [[giraffe]]s due to the danger of injury.

Extensive statistics collected over various studies show that lions normally feed on mammals in the range 190–550&nbsp;kg (420–1210&nbsp;lb). In Africa, wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey (making nearly half of the lion prey in the [[Serengeti]]) followed by zebra.<ref>''The Art of Being a Lion'' pg 186, Christine and Michel Denis-Huot, Friedman/Fairfax, 2002</ref> Most adult [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, and smaller [[gazelle]]s, [[impala]], and other agile antelopes are generally excluded. However giraffes and buffalos are often taken in certain regions. For instance, in Kruger National Park, giraffes are regularly hunted.<ref name="Pienaar69">{{Cite journal|author=Pienaar U de V |year=1969 |title=Predator–prey relationships amongst the larger mammals of the Kruger National Park |journal=Koedoe |volume=12 |pages=108–176 |id= }}</ref> In Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet,<ref>"Among the Elephants", Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton, 1975</ref> due to the high number density of buffaloes.

[[Image:Lions taking down cape buffalo.jpg|thumb|right|Four lions take down a cape buffalo in the central Serengeti, Tanzania]]
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by [[vulture]]s from kilometers away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Stander, P. E.|title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=445–454|year=1992|doi=10.1007/BF00170175}}</ref>

Young lions first display stalking behavior around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.<ref name="Schaller153">Schaller, p. 153</ref>

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age.<ref name="Schaller29">Schaller, p. 29</ref> Lions do not [[mating|mate]] at any specific time of year, and the females are [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|polyestrous]].<ref name="Schaller174">Schaller, p. 174</ref> As with other cats, the male lion's [[penis]] has spines which point backwards. Upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which may cause ovulation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asdell |first=Sydney A. |title=Patterns of mammalian reproduction |year=1993|origyear= 1964 |publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-1753-5}}</ref> A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is [[Estrous cycle|in heat]];<ref name="Schaller142">Schaller, p. 142</ref> during a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple copulates twenty to forty times a day and are likely to forgo eating. Lions reproduce very well in captivity.

[[File:Panthera leo -Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania -mating-8.jpg|thumb|left|Lions mating in [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], Tanzania]]
The average gestation period is around 110&nbsp;days,<ref name="Schaller174"/> the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself whilst the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept.<ref name="Scott">Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela. (2002), ''Big Cat Diary: Lion'', p. 45</ref> The cubs themselves are born blind—their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1&nbsp;kg (2.6–4.6&nbsp;lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<ref name="Schaller143">Schaller, p. 143</ref> The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.<ref name="Scott"/>

Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.<ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela. p. 45</ref> However, sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronize their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, are usually dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes—consequently, death by starvation is more common amongst the younger cubs.
[[Image:PregnantLioness.jpg|thumb|A pregnant lioness (right)]]
In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede towards the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death whilst warding off the lioness. Furthermore, when one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any existing young cubs,<ref name="Packpus83">{{Cite journal|author=Packer, C., Pusey, A. E. |year=1983 |month=May |title= Adaptations of female lions to infanticide by incoming males|journal= American Naturalist |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–728 |doi= 10.1086/284097}}</ref> perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. All in all, as many as 80 percent of the cubs will die before the age of two.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Macdonald |first=David |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York |page=31|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. However, they soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, playing amongst themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions towards the cubs varies—sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.<ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela; p. 46</ref>

[[Image:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004.JPG|thumb|The tolerance of male lions towards the cubs varies. They are, however, generally more likely to share food with the cubs than with the lionesses.]]
Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4–5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crandall |first=Lee S. |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |oclc=557916 }}</ref> if they have not already been critically injured whilst defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male.<ref name="Packpus83"/>

Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although the majority of females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted.<ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela. p. 68''</ref> Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members.

===Communication===
[[Image:Lion cub with mother.jpg|thumb|right|Head rubbing and licking are common social behaviors within a pride]]
When resting, lion socialization occurs through a number of behaviors, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,<ref name="Schaller85">Schaller, p. 85</ref> which have been compared with grooming in primates.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=Desmond Morris|last=Sparks |first=J |title=Primate Ethology |chapter=Allogrooming in primates:a review |year=1967 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |isbn=0-297-74828-9}} (2007 edition: 0-202-30826-X)</ref> Head rubbing—nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion—appears to be a form of greeting,<ref>{{de icon}}{{Cite book|last=Leyhausen |first=Paul |title=Verhaltensstudien an Katzen|edition= 2nd |year=1960 |publisher=Paul Parey |location=Berlin |isbn=3-489-71836-4 }}</ref> as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.<ref name="Schaller858">Schaller, p. 85–88</ref> Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.<ref name="Schaller8891">Schaller, p. 88–91</ref>

Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.<ref name="Schaller92102">Schaller, p. 92–102</ref> Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, purring, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing and roaring. Lions tend to [[roar (animal)|roar]] in a very characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off into a series of shorter ones. They most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of {{convert|8|km}}, is used to advertise the animal's presence.<ref name="Schaller10313">Schaller, p. 103–113</ref> Lions have the loudest roar of any big cat.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
In areas where lions and [[spotted hyena]]s are [[sympatric]], the two species occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can be as high as 68.8%.<ref name="prey">[http://www.zbs.bialowieza.pl/g2/pdf/1598.pdf ''Prey preferences of the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and degree of dietary overlap with the lion (Panthera leo)''] by M. W. Hayward, Terrestrial Ecology Research Unit, Department of Zoology, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Eastern Cape, South Africa</ref> Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. Spotted hyenas themselves tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, whether there is food or not. Lions will readily appropriate the kills of spotted hyenas: in the Ngorongoro crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact which was proven by Dr. Hans Kruuk, who found that lions repeatedly approached him whenever he played the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding.<ref name="Kruuk21">''Interactions between Hyenas and other Carnivorous Animals'' from Hans Kruuk’s ''The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour'' The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637, 1972</ref> When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished.<ref name="schaller">''Interactions with hyenas, jackals and vultures'' from ''The Serengeti lion: a study of predator–prey relations'' by George B. Schaller, University of Chicago Press, 1976</ref> In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force the lions off a kill. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food involved. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason: one male lion was filmed killing two matriarch hyenas on separate occasions without eating them,<ref name="enemies">{{cite video|people=Dereck and Beverley Joubert |title= Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas |medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|date=1992}}</ref> and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in [[Etosha]]. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories.<ref>''Competitive interactions between spotted hyenas and lions in the Etosha National Park, Namibia'' by Trinkel, Martina; Kastberger, Gerald. ''African Journal of Ecology'', Volume 43, Number 3, September 2005 , pp. 220–224(5), Blackwell Publishing</ref> Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.<ref name="Kruuk21"/>

Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s in areas where they are sympatric. They will steal their kills and will kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah has a 50 percent chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators.<ref>O'Brien, S., D. Wildt, M. Bush (1986). "The Cheetah in Genetic Peril". Scientific American 254: 68–76.</ref> Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, up to 90 percent of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush. Leopards also use such tactics, but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions. However, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills.<ref name="Schaller293">Schaller, p. 293</ref> Similarly, lions dominate [[African Wild Dog|African wild dogs]], not only taking their kills but also preying on both young and adult dogs (although the latter are rarely caught).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/lycapict.htm |title=Animal Info—African Wild Dog |publisher=Animalinfo.org |date=2005-11-26 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref>

The [[Nile crocodile]] is the only sympatric predator (besides humans) that can singly threaten the lion. Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other.

Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline.
Lions are one species included in the [[Species Survival Plan]], a coordinated attempt by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not [[genetic pollution|genetically pure]], having been hybridized with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/>

===Man-eaters===
{{Main|Man-eater}}
While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; well-publicized cases include the [[Tsavo maneaters]], where 28 railway workers building the [[Uganda Railway|Kenya-Uganda Railway]] were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in [[Kenya]] in 1898, and the 1991 [[Mfuwe]] man-eater, which killed six people in the Laungwa River Valley in [[Zambia]].<ref>{{cite web| coauthors=Wayne Hosek | title=Man-eaters of the Field Museum: Lion of Mfuwe | work=Field Museum of Natural History | publisher=Field Museum of Natural History | year=2007| url =http://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibits/exhibit_sites/tsavo/mfuwe.html | accessdate =16 September 2007}}</ref> In both, the hunters who killed the lions wrote books detailing the animals' predatory behavior. The Mfuwe and Tsavo incidents bear similarities: the lions in both incidents were larger than normal, lacked manes, and seemed to suffer from [[dental caries|tooth decay]]. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that, while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |coauthors=Ellis J.

The authors note that the relationship is well-attested amongst other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030031426/http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archivedate=2007-10-30 |accessdate=7 July 2007 |last=Peterhans |first=Julian C.

The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period—a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.<ref name="Packer05">{{Cite journal|last=Packer |first=C. |coauthors=Ikanda, D.; Kissui, B.; Kushnir, H. |year=2005 |month=August |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927–928 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828}}</ref>

Author Robert R. Frump wrote in ''The Man-eaters of Eden'' that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in [[South Africa]] are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frump |first=RR |title=The Man-Eaters of Eden: Life and Death in Kruger National Park |year=2006 |publisher=The Lyons Press |location= |isbn=1-592288-92-8}}</ref>

Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, [[crocodile]]s, elephants, hippos, and [[snake]]s, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few [[conservation movement|conservationists]] who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.<ref name="Packer05"/>

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004.

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but the lesser-known incidents in the late 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania).

===In captivity===
Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that are the core of [[zoo]] exhibits since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible.<ref name="dc81">de Courcy, p. 81</ref> Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,<ref>de Courcy, p. 82</ref> there are over 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world.

Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and [[elephant]]s, in particular, symbolized power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 24–28.</ref>

The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as [[Margaret of Anjou]] the wife of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], either sought or were given animals.

The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than [[Giant Panda|pandas]].<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 122.</ref> Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 114, 117.</ref> The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 113.</ref> Explorers and hunters exploited a popular [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures.

Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos.<ref name="dc69">de Courcy, p. 69</ref> In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of [[mesh|wire mesh]] or [[laminated glass]] instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden|Oklahoma City Zoological Park]].<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam.{{Failed verification|date=March 2010}}<ref name="WAZA"/>

There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness [[Elsa the Lioness|Elsa]], who was raised by [[George Adamson]] and his wife [[Joy Adamson]] and came to develop a strong bond with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films.

Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs.

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act, such as [[Siegfried & Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[cougar]]s. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.<ref name = "baratay187"/> Van Amburgh performed before Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]] in 1838 when he toured [[Great Britain]]. Martin composed a [[pantomime]] titled ''Les Lions de Mysore'' ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed [[equestrianism]] acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.<ref name="baratay187">Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 187.</ref>  The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth.  The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903–1965).<ref>{{Cite book| first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | edition= | publisher=HarperCollins | location= | isbn= 0-06-016923-0 }}</ref>

The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong but noble. A common depiction is their representation as "[[Monarchy|king]] of the jungle" or "king of beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,<ref name="Garai73">{{Cite book|last=Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0671-21773-9}}</ref> as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several [[Aesop's Fables|fables]] of the

The Asiatic lion is a common motif in [[Chinese art]].

Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of [[Buddhist art]] to China in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (after the sixth century AD), lions were usually depicted without wings, their bodies became thicker and shorter, and their manes became curly.<ref>Li Ling (May 2002).
