Archaeological research indicates that people were living on the islands of Japan as early as the Upper Paleolithic period.

Influence from the outside world followed by long periods of isolation has characterized [[History of Japan|Japan's history]].

{{Main|History of Japan}}

===Etymology===
{{Main|Names of Japan}}
The [[English language|English]] word ''Japan'' is an [[exonym]]. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] names for Japan are {{Nihongo|''Nippon''|にっぽん}} {{Audio|ja-nippon(日本).ogg|listen}} and {{Nihongo|''Nihon''|にほん}} {{Audio|ja-nihon(日本).ogg|listen}}; both names are written using the [[kanji]] {{nihongo2|'''日本'''}}. The Japanese name ''Nippon'' is used for most official purposes, including on [[Japanese yen|money]], postage stamps, and for many international sporting events. ''Nihon'' is a more casual term and is the most frequently used in contemporary speech. Japanese people refer to themselves as {{Nihongo|''Nihonjin''|日本人}} and to their language as {{Nihongo|''Nihongo''|日本語}}. Both ''Nippon'' and ''Nihon'' literally mean "sun-origin" and are often translated as the ''Land of the Rising Sun''. This nomenclature comes from [[Japanese missions to Imperial China|Imperial correspondence]] with the [[China|Chinese]] [[Sui Dynasty]] and refers to Japan's eastward position relative to China. Before ''Nihon'' came into official use, Japan was known as {{Nihongo||倭|Wa}} or {{Nihongo||倭国|Wakoku}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=The emergence of Japanese kingship|first=Joan R. |last=Piggott|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-804-72832-1|pages=143–144}}</ref>

The English word for Japan came to the West via early trade routes. The early [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or possibly [[Wu Chinese]] (吳語) word for Japan was recorded by [[Marco Polo]] as ''Cipangu.'' In modern [[Shanghainese]], a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters {{nihongo2|日本}} 'Japan' is ''Zeppen'' {{IPA-wuu|zəʔpən|}}; in Wu, the character 日 has two pronunciations, {{Nihongo|informal|白讀}} {{IPA|[niʔ]}} and {{Nihongo|formal|文讀}} {{IPA|[zəʔ]}}. (In some southern Wu dialects, 日本 is pronounced {{IPA-wuu|niʔpən|}}, similar to its pronunciation in Japanese.) The old [[Malay language|Malay]] word for Japan, ''Jepang'', was borrowed from a Chinese language, and this Malay word was encountered by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders in [[Malacca]] in the 16th century. It is thought the Portuguese traders were the first to bring the word to Europe. It was first recorded in English in a 1565 letter, spelled ''Giapan''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mancall|first=Peter C.|title=Travel narratives from the age of discovery: an anthology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=156–157|chapter=Of the Ilande of Giapan, 1565}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
[[File:Genjosanzo.jpg|thumb|left|An illustrated scroll from the 1100s]]
A [[Japanese Paleolithic|Paleolithic]] culture around [[Upper Paleolithic|30,000&nbsp;BC]] constitutes the first known habitation of Japan. This was followed from around 14,000&nbsp;BC (the start of the [[Jōmon period]]) by a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] culture, possibly ancestors of the [[Ainu people]], characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|last=Travis|first=John|title= Jomon Genes|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~annj/courses/notes/jomon_genes.html|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> Decorated clay vessels from this period, often with plaited patterns, are some of the oldest surviving examples of [[pottery]] in the world. The [[Yayoi period]], starting around 500&nbsp;BC, saw the introduction of new practices like [[rice|wet-rice farming]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Road of rice plant|url=http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-25.html|publisher=[[National Science Museum of Japan]]|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> a new style of pottery,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kofun Period|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kofu/hd_kofu.htm|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> and [[metallurgy]], brought by migrants from China and Korea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yayoi Culture|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/yayo/hd_yayo.htm|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>

The Japanese first appear in written history in the Chinese ''[[Book of Han]]''. According to the ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'', the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called [[Yamataikoku]]. [[Buddhism]] was first introduced to Japan from [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], but the subsequent development of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] was primarily influenced by China.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Brown, Delmer M.|year=1993 |title=The Cambridge History of Japan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=140–149}}</ref> Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and eventually gained acceptance beginning in the [[Asuka period]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Japanese Experience: A Short History of Japan |first=William Gerald|last=Beasley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=42 |isbn=0520225600 }}</ref>

The [[Nara period]] of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state, centered on an imperial court in the city of [[Heijō Palace|Heijō-kyō]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). In addition to the continuing adoption of Chinese administrative practices, the Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent written literature with the completion of the massive chronicles ''[[Kojiki]]'' (712) and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720).<ref>{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=64–79 | isbn=978-1405123594}}</ref> The [[smallpox]] epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hays|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1851096582|page=31}}</ref> In 784, [[Emperor Kammu]] moved the capital from Nara to [[Nagaoka-kyō]] for a ten-year period before relocating it to [[Heian-kyō]] (modern [[Kyoto]]) in 794, where it remained for more than a millennium.<ref>{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=79–87 | isbn=978-1405123594}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]], during which time a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]]. [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki's]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem ''[[Kimigayo]]'' were written during this time.<ref>{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=122–123 | isbn=978-1405123594}}</ref>

===Feudal era===
Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the rival [[Taira clan]], [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was appointed [[Shogun]] and established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, the [[Hōjō clan]] came to rule as regents for the shoguns. [[Zen]] Buddhism was introduced from China in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.<ref>{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405123591|pages=106–112}}</ref> The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, aided by a storm that the Japanese interpreted as a ''[[kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'' or Divine Wind.

During the 16th century, traders and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] from Portugal reached Japan for the first time, initiating active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West (''[[Nanban trade]]''). [[Oda Nobunaga]] conquered numerous other daimyo by using European technology and [[firearm]]s, and had almost unified the nation when he was assassinated in 1582. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] succeeded Nobunaga and united the nation in 1590. Hideyoshi [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|invaded Korea twice]], but following several defeats by Korean and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Chinese forces and Hideyoshi's death, Japanese troops were withdrawn in 1598.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen|last=Turnbull|year=2002 |title=Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War |publisher=Cassel |page=227| isbn=978-0304359486}}</ref>

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] served as regent for Hideyoshi's son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]], using his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. Ieyasu was appointed [[shogun|shōgun]] in 1603 and established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|title=Toyotomi Hideyoshi|year=2010|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=9781846039607|page=61}}</ref> The Tokugawa shogunate enacted a variety of measures such as ''[[Buke shohatto]]'' to control the autonomous daimyo.<ref>{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405123591|pages=142–143}}</ref> In 1639, the shogunate began the isolationist ''[[sakoku]]'' ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Toby|first=Ronald P.|title=Reopening the Question of Sakoku: Diplomacy in the Legitimation of the Tokugawa Bakufu|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|date=1977|volume=3|issue=2|pages=323–363}}</ref> The study of Western sciences, known as ''[[rangaku]]'', continued during this period through contact with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] enclave at [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]].

On March 31, 1854, [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] and the "[[Black Ships]]" of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the [[Bakumatsu]] period brought Japan into economic and political crises. The resignation of the shogunate led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of [[Abolition of the han system|a centralized state]] unified under the name of the Emperor ([[Meiji Restoration]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405123591|pages=289–296}}</ref> Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]], and assembled the [[Diet of Japan|Imperial Diet]]. The Meiji Restoration transformed the [[Empire of Japan]] into an industrialized world power that embarked on a number of military conflicts to expand the nation's sphere of influence. After victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), Japan gained control of [[Taiwan]], Korea, and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Matsusaka|first=Y.

===20th century===
The early 20th century saw a brief period of "[[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]]" overshadowed by increasing [[expansionism]] and [[Japanese militarism|militarization]]. [[World War I]] enabled Japan, which joined the side of the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], to [[Japan during World War I|widen its influence and territorial holdings]]. Japan continued its expansionist policy by occupying [[Manchuria]] in 1931. As a result of [[Lytton Report|international condemnation of this occupation]], Japan resigned from the [[League of Nations]] two years later. In 1935, local assemblies under Japanese control were established in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rigger|first=Shelley|title=Politics in Taiwan|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415172098|page=36}}</ref> In 1936, Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], and in 1940 signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] to join the Axis Powers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Axis Alliance|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/pre-war/361125a.html#3|publisher=iBiblio|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> In 1941, Japan negotiated a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|neutrality pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405123591|page=442}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Japan|Geology of Japan}}
[[File:Japan topo en.jpg|thumb|Topographic map]]

Japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of Asia. The country, including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes [[24th parallel north|24°]] and [[46th parallel north|46°N]], and longitudes [[122nd meridian east|122°]] and [[146th meridian east|146°E]]. The main islands, from north to south, are [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshū]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyūshū]]. The [[Ryukyu Islands]], including [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], are a chain of islands south of Kyushū. Together they are often known as the [[Japanese Archipelago]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McCargo|first=Duncan|title=Contemporary Japan|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0333710022|pages=8–11}}</ref>

About 70 to 80 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use.<ref name="cia"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Japan|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4142.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> This is because of the generally steep elevations, climate and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground and heavy rain. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan is one of the [[list of countries by population density|most densely populated countries]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=World Population Prospects |publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>

The islands of Japan are located in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north. Japan has 108 active volcanoes. Destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times each century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/japan_tec.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070204064754/http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/japan_tec.html |archivedate=4 February 2007 |title=Tectonics and Volcanoes of Japan |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|1923 Tokyo earthquake]] killed over 140,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=C.D.|title=The 1923 Tokyo Earthquake and Fire|url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/kanto/tokyo1923.pdf|publisher=University of California Berkeley|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=2002}}</ref> The most recent major quakes are the [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake]] and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin Earthquake]] of 1995.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Japan}}
[[File:Ocean Expo Park.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Okinawa]] has a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers.]]

The climate of Japan is predominantly [[temperate]], but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]], [[Inland Sea|Seto Inland Sea]], Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a temperate climate with long, cold winters and cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snow banks in the winter. In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshū's west coast, the northwest wind in the wintertime brings heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures, because of the [[foehn wind]] phenomenon. The Central Highland is a  typical inland climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night. Precipitation is light. The mountains of the [[Chūgoku region|Chūgoku]] and [[Shikoku]] regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from the seasonal winds, bringing mild weather throughout the year. The Pacific east coast experiences cold winters with little snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. [[tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are common.<ref>{{cite book|last=Karan|first=Pradyumna Prasad|title=Japan in the 21st century|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813123429|pages=18–21, 41|coauthor=Gilbreath, Dick}}</ref>

Japan has nine forest [[ecoregions in Japan|ecoregions]] which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] in the Ryūkyū and Bonin islands, to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to [[temperate coniferous forest]]s in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/spotflora.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070213035135/http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/spotflora.htm |archivedate=13 February 2007 |title=Flora and Fauna: Diversity and regional uniqueness |publisher=Embassy of Japan in the USA |accessdate=1 April 2007}}</ref>

In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations. As an inevitable consequence, [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan|environmental pollution]] occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern over the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=日本の大気汚染の歴史|url=http://www.erca.go.jp/taiki/history/ko_syousyu.html|publisher=Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]] also encouraged the efficient use of energy due to Japan's lack of natural resources.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sekiyama|first=Takeshi|title=Japan's international cooperation for energy efficiency and conservation in Asian region|url=http://nice.erina.or.jp/en/pdf/C-SEKIYAMA.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216005103/http://nice.erina.or.jp/en/pdf/C-SEKIYAMA.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2008|publisher=Energy Conservation Center|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> Current priority environmental issues include urban [[air pollution]] ([[NOx]], suspended particulate matter, toxics), [[waste management]], water [[eutrophication]], [[nature conservation]], [[climate change]], chemical management and international co-operation for environmental conservation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Performance Review of Japan|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/17/2110905.pdf|publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref>

As a signatory of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligations to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps related to curbing climate change. The [[Cool Biz campaign]] introduced under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was targeted at reducing energy use through the reduction of air conditioning in government offices. Japan is preparing to force industry to make cuts in greenhouse gases, taking the lead in a country struggling to meet its Kyoto Protocol obligations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbcsd.org/plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?type=DocDet&ObjectId=MzAyNzQ |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development |publisher=WBCSD |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>

Japan has the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ponsonby-Fane|first=Richard|title=The Imperial House of Japan|publisher=Ponsonby Memorial Society|date=1959|pages=28–29}}</ref>]]

Japan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] where the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] as "the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people". Power is held chiefly by the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/law/index.htm |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=House of Councillors of the National Diet of Japan |date=3 November 1946 |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> The Emperor acts as the head of state on diplomatic occasions. [[Akihito]] is the current Emperor of Japan; [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan]], stands as next in line to the throne.

Japan's legislative organ is the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], a bicameral [[parliament]]. The Diet consists of a [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a [[House of Councillors]] of 242 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is [[universal suffrage]] for adults over 20 years of age,<ref name="cia"/> with a [[secret ballot]] for all elected offices.<ref name="Constitution"/> In 2009, the social liberal [[Democratic Party of Japan]] took power after 54 years of the liberal conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s rule.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harden|first=Blaine|title=Ruling Party Is Routed In Japan|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/30/AR2009083000854.html|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=31 August 2009}}</ref>

The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government. The Prime Minister is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members, and must enjoy the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office. The Prime Minister is the head of the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] (the literal translation of his Japanese title is "Prime Minister of the Cabinet") and appoints and dismisses the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]], a majority of whom must be Diet members. [[Naoto Kan]] was designated by the Diet to replace [[Yukio Hatoyama]] as the Prime Minister of Japan on June 2, 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100604x1.html|title=Diet votes in Kan as prime minister|date=4 June 2010|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet. Emperor Akihito formally appointed Kan as the country's 94th Prime Minister on June 8.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fackler|first=Martin|title=Focusing on Future, Premier in Japan Unveils Cabinet|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/world/asia/09japan.html|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 June 2010}}</ref>

Historically influenced by [[Chinese law]], the [[law of Japan|Japanese legal system]] developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as ''[[Kujikata Osadamegaki]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Meryll|title=Japanese legal system : text, cases & materials|year=2002|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=9781859416730|pages=55–58|edition=2nd}}</ref> However, since the late 19th century, the [[judicial system of Japan|judicial system]] has been largely based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German civil code]]. With post-World War II modifications, the code remains in effect in present-day Japan.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanamori|first=Shigenari|title=German influences on Japanese Pre-War Constitution and Civil Code|journal=European Journal of Law and Economics|date=1 January 1999|volume=7|issue=1|pages=93–95|doi=10.1023/A:1008688209052}}</ref> Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature with the [[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] approval of the Emperor.

===Health===
In Japan, health care services are provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/lessons.html |first=Victor|last=Rodwin|title=Health Care in Japan |publisher=New York University |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos/Health.html |title=Health Insurance: General Characteristics |publisher=National Institute of Population and Social Security Research |accessdate=28 March 2007}}</ref>

Japanese culture has evolved greatly over the years, from the country's original Jōmon arts to its contemporary culture, which combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include [[Japanese handicrafts|crafts]] ([[ikebana]], [[origami]], [[ukiyo-e]], [[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]], [[Japanese lacquerware|lacquerware]], [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|pottery]]), performances ([[bunraku]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[rakugo]]), traditions ([[List of Japanese games|games]], [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[Budō]], [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], [[Japanese garden|gardens]], [[Katana|swords]]) and [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]].

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Japan}}
Japanese music is eclectic, borrowing instruments, scales and styles from neighboring cultures. Many instruments, such as the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]], were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied [[recitative]] of the [[Noh]] drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like [[shamisen]], from the sixteenth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Malm|first=William P.|title=Traditional Japanese music and musical instruments|year=2000|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=9784770023957|pages=31–45|edition=New}}</ref> Western [[classical music]], introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of the culture.

The earliest works of [[Japanese literature]] include two history books, the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', and the 8th century poetry book ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', all written in Chinese characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~ascj/2000/200015.htm |title= Asian Studies Conference, Japan (2000) |publisher=Meiji Gakuin University |accessdate=1 April 2007}}</ref> In the early days of the Heian period, the system of transcription known as ''kana'' ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) was created as phonograms.

During the Edo period, literature became not so much the field of the samurai aristocracy as that of the [[chōnin]], the ordinary people. [[Yomihon]], for example, became popular and reveals this profound change in the readership and authorship.<ref name="ispmsu"/> The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms, during which Japanese literature integrated Western influences. [[Natsume Sōseki]] and [[Mori Ōgai]] were the first "modern" novelists of Japan, followed by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]], [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]], [[Yasunari Kawabata]], [[Yukio Mishima]] and, more recently, [[Haruki Murakami]]. Japan has two [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize-winning]] authors—[[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1968) and [[Kenzaburo Oe]] (1994).<ref name="ispmsu"/>
