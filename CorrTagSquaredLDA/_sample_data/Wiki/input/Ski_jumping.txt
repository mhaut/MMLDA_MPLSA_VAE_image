'''Ski jumping''' is a sport in which skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump and attempt to land as far as possible down the hill below. In addition to the length of the jump, judges give points for style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long ({{convert|260|to|275|cm|in}}). Ski jumping is predominantly a [[winter sport]], performed on snow, and is part of the [[Winter Olympic Games]], but can also be performed in summer on artificial surfaces &ndash; porcelain or frost rail track on the [[wikt:inrun|inrun]], plastic on the landing hill.

==History==
[[Image:Trampolino pragelato.jpg|thumb|267px|The Ski Jumping Complex in [[Pragelato]] during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] of [[Turin]].]]
True ski jumping originates in [[Morgedal]], [[Norway]]. [[Olaf Rye]], a Norwegian lieutenant, was the first known ski jumper. In 1809, he launched himself 9.5 metres in the air in front of an audience of other soldiers. By 1862, ski jumpers were tackling much larger jumps and traveling longer. Norway's [[Sondre Norheim]] jumped 30 metres over a rock without the benefit of poles. His record stood for three decades. The first proper competition was held in [[Trysil]]. The first widely known ski jumping competition was the [[Husebyrennene]], held in [[Oslo]] in 1879, with Olaf Haugann of Norway setting the first world record for the longest ski jump at 20 metres.<ref>[http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/e_index.htm?/nor/nore_huseby.htm ''Oslo – Huseby'' (Ski Jumping Hill Archive)]</ref> The annual event was moved to [[Holmenkollen ski jump|Holmenkollen]] from 1892, and Holmenkollen has remained the pinnacle of ski jumping venues.

==Competition==
Today, [[Ski jumping World Cup|World Cup ski jumping competitions]] are held on three types of hills:

;Normal hill competitions
:for which the calculation line is found at approximately {{convert|80|-|100|m|ft}}. Distances of up to and over {{convert|110|m|ft}} can be reached.
;Large hill competitions
:for which the calculation line is found at approximately {{convert|120|-|130|m|ft}}. Distances of over {{convert|145|m|ft}} can be obtained on the larger hills. Both individual and team competitions are run on these hills.
;Ski-flying competitions
:for which the calculation line is found at {{convert|185|m|ft}}. The Ski Flying World Record of {{convert|239|m|ft}} is held by [[Bjørn Einar Romøren]], and was set in [[Planica]], Slovenia in March 2005.

Amateur and junior competitions are held on smaller hills.

Individual [[Ski jumping at the Winter Olympics|Olympic competition]] consists of a training jump and two scored jumps. The team event consists of four members of the same nation, who each jump twice.

Ski jumping is one of the two elements of the [[Nordic combined]] sport.

===Summer jumping===
Ski jumping can also be performed in the summer on a porcelain track and plastic grass combined with water. There are also many competitions during the summer. The World Cup (Summer Grand Prix) often includes those hills:

* [[Hinterzarten]] K-95
* [[Courchevel]] K-120
* [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] K-105
* [[Klingenthal]] K-125
* [[Zakopane]] K-120
* [[Hakuba]] K-120
* [[Pragelato]] K-125
* [[Liberec]] K-120
* [[Kranj]] K-100
* [[Wisla]] K-120
[[Ski jumping Fis-Cup]] and [[Ski jumping Continental Cup|Continental Cup]] also have summer competitions and even more than the World Cup.

===Olympic competition===
According to the International Olympic Committee's site<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Sports/All-Sports/Skiing/Ski-Jumping/ | title=Ski Jumping | publisher=International Olympic Committe}}</ref>:
<blockquote>Ski jumping has been part of the Olympic Winter Games since the first Games in [[Chamonix|Chamonix Mont-Blanc]] in 1924. The Large Hill competition was included on the Olympic programme for the 1964 Olympic Games in Innsbruck.</blockquote>  

The existence of a men's competition without a women's competition has become a major bone of contention as the field of elite female competitors has grown.

===Women's ski jumping===
Currently, women ski jump internationally in the Continental cup. On 26 May 2006, the [[International Ski Federation]] decided to allow women to ski jump at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009|2009 Nordic World Ski Championships]] in [[Liberec]], [[Czech Republic]] and then to have a team event for women at the 2011 world championships. FIS also decided to submit a proposal to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to allow women to compete at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/news/pressreleases/pressreleases2006/gacongressdecisions.html | title=FIS MEDIA INFO: Decisions of the 45th International Ski Congress in Vilamoura/Algarve (POR) | date=2006-05-26 | publisher=Fédération Internationale de Ski | accessdate=2009-11-14}}</ref>

On 28 November 2006, the proposal for a women's ski jumping event was rejected by the Executive Board of the IOC. The reason for the rejection cited the low number of athletes as well as few participating countries in the sport. The Executive Board noted that women's ski jumping has yet to be fully established internationally.<ref>http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/28/sports/ME_SPT_OLY_IOC_Meetings.php IOC approves skicross; rejects women's ski jumping</ref> Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee stated that women's ski jumping will not be an Olympic event because "we do not want the medals to be diluted and watered down," referring to the relatively small number of potential competitors in women's ski jumping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080228/ski_jumping_080227/20080228/|title=Rogge: Women jumpers would dilute Olympics medals |date=2008-02-28 | publisher=CTV News | accessdate=2009-11-14}}</ref> 

It has been noted that while the number of women in ski jumping is not insignificant, the field has a much wider spread in terms of talent, in that the top men are all of a similar level of strength competitively, while the women are more varied, even in the top tiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1109/p17s03-ussc.html|title=Why women can't ski jump in the Winter Olympics |author=Christa Case Bryant |date=2009-11-08|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-11-14 }}</ref>

A group of 15 competitive female ski jumpers filed a suit against the [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|Vancouver Organizing Committee]] (VANOC) claiming that conducting a men's ski jumping event without a women's event in the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 would be in direct violation of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/16139/ | title=Female Ski Jumpers Seem Olympic Inclusion | author=Cindy Chan | date=2009-04-29 | publisher=Epoch Times | accessdate= 2009-11-14}}</ref>  The arguments associated with this suit were argued 20 to 24 April 2009 and a judgment came down on June 10, 2009 against the ski jumpers.  The judge ruled that although the women were being discriminated against,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/ski-jumping/news/newsid=12739.html#no+female+flight+2010?cid=rssctv | title=No female flight in 2010: B.C. court rejects ski jump bid | author=Rod Mickelburgh | date=2009-07-10 | publisher=CTV Olympics|accessdate=2009-11-14}}</ref> the issue is a International Olympic Committee responsibility and thus not governed by the charter.  It further ruled that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not apply to VANOC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/07/10/bc-olympic-women-ski-jump-decision.html | title=Female ski jumpers lose Olympic battle | author=CBC News |date=2009-07-10 |publisher=CBC News | accessdate=2009-11-14}}</ref> Three British Columbia judges unanimously denied an appeal on November 13, 2009. The American actress and documentary film producer [[Virginia Madsen]] has chronicled the Canadian team's efforts in a film called ''Fighting Gravity'' (2009).<ref>Tatianan Siegel, [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002265.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 "Virginia Madsen to defy 'Gravity'"], ''Variety'', Apr. 8, 2009</ref>

==Scoring==
The winner is decided on a scoring system based on distance, style, inrun length and wind conditions.

Each hill has a target called the ''calculation point'' (or ''K point'' or "critical point") which is a [[par]] distance to aim for. It is also the place where many jumpers land, in the middle of the landing area. This point is marked by the ''K line'' on the landing strip. For K-90 and K-120 competitions, the K line is at {{convert|90|m|ft}} and {{convert|120|m|ft}} respectively. Skiers are awarded 60 points if they land on the K Line. Skiers not landing on the K Line receive or lose points for every metre (3&nbsp;ft) they miss the mark by, depending on if they surpass it or fall short, respectively. The value of a metre is determined from the size of the hill. The K point is the point on the hill where the slope begins to flatten as measured from the take off.

In addition, five judges are based in a tower to the side of the expected landing point. They can award up to 20 points each for style based on keeping the skis steady during flight, balance, good body position, and landing. The highest and lowest style scores are disregarded, with the remaining three scores added to the distance score. Thus, a perfectly-scored K-120 jump - with at least four of the judges awarding 20 points each - and the jumper landing on the K-point, is awarded a total of 120 points.

In January 2010, a new scoring system was introduced to compensate for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and take-off speed are important variables that determine the value of a jump, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be equal for everyone and thus unfair. The jumper will now receive or lose points if the inrun length is adjusted. An advanced calculation also determines plus/minus points for the actual wind conditions at the time of the jump. These points are added or withdrawn from the original scores from the jump itself.

In the individual event, the scores from each skier's two competition jumps are combined to determine the winner.

== Rules ==

Ski jumpers below the minimum safe body mass index are penalized with a shorter maximum ski length, reducing the aerodynamic lift they can achieve. These rules have been credited with stopping the most severe cases of underweight athletes, but some competitors still lose weight to maximize the distance they can jump.<ref name="SlidingScale">[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/sports/olympics/12skijump.html For Ski Jumpers, a Sliding Scale of Weight, Distance and Health]</ref>

== Technique==
The ski jump is divided into four separate sections; 1) In-run, 2) Take-off (jump), 3) Flight and 4) Landing.
In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximise the outcome of ultimate length and style marks. 

Using the modern [[V-style|V-technique]], pioneered by [[Jan Boklöv]] of Sweden in 1985, world-class skiers are able to exceed the distance of the take-off hill by about 10% compared to the previous technique with parallel skis. [[Aerodynamics]] has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits. This follows a period when loopholes in the rules seemed to favour skinny jumpers in stiff, air foil-like suits.

Previous techniques first included the [[Kongsberger technique]], developed in [[Kongsberg]], Norway by two ski jumpers, [[Jacob Tullin Thams]] and [[Sigmund Ruud]] following World War I. This technique had the upper body bent at the hip, a wide forward lean, and arms extended to the front with the skis parallel to each other. It would lead to jumping length going from 45 meters to over 100 meters. In the 1950s [[Andreas Daescher]] of Switzerland and [[Erich Windisch]] of Germany modified the Kongsberger technique by placing his arms backward toward his hips for a closer lean. The [[Daescher technique]] and [[Windisch technique]] were the standard for ski jumping from the 1950s.

Until the mid 1970s, the Ski jumper would come down the in-run of the hill with both arms pointing forwards. This changed when the former East German Ski jumper [[Jochen Danneberg]] introduced the new in-run technique of directing the arms backwards in a more aerodynamic position.

The landing requires the skiers to touch the ground in the Telemark landing style. This involves the jumper landing with one foot in front of the other, mimicking the style of the Norwegian inventors of [[Telemark skiing]]. Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the deduction of style marks (points).

==Popularity==
Ski jumping is popular among spectators and TV audiences in Scandinavia and Central Europe. Almost all world-class ski jumpers come from those regions or from Japan. Traditionally, the strongest countries are Finland, Norway, Germany, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Slovenia, and Japan. However, there have always been successful ski jumpers from other countries as well (see list below). The [[Four Hills Tournament]], held annually at four sites in [[Bavaria]], Germany and Austria around New Year's, is very popular.

There have been attempts to spread the popularity of the sport by finding ways by which the construction and upkeep of practicing and competition venues can be made easier. These include plastic fake snow to provide a slippery surface even during the summer time and in locations where snow is a rare occurrence.

==Ski flying==
'''Ski flying''' is an extreme version of ski jumping. The events take place in big hills with a K-spot of at least {{convert|185|m|ft}}. The "father" of ski flying is [[Janez Gorišek]], an engineer, sportsman and enthusiastic sport-promoter who designed the Planica ski-jump. There are five ski flying hills in the world today: [[Vikersundbakken]] in [[Vikersund]], Norway; [[Oberstdorf]], Germany; [[Kulm]] Austria; [[Letalnica]], [[Planica]], Slovenia; and [[Harrachov]], Czech Republic. A sixth hill, [[Copper Peak]] in the western [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], is currently disused, although there are plans to rebuild it to FIS standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://copperpeak.org|title=copperpeak.org<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> There are plans for more ski flying hills, even for an indoor ski flying hill in [[Ylitornio]], [[Finland]]. The biggest hill is in Planica, where all the [[World's longest ski jumps|longest ski jumps]] have taken place. It's possible to fly more than {{convert|200|m|ft}} in all the ski flying hills, and the current World Record is {{convert|239|m|ft|sigfig=3}}, set by Norwegian [[Bjørn Einar Romøren]] at Planica in 2005. This record was surpassed by [[Janne Ahonen]] of Finland at the same competition, but his {{convert|240|m|ft|sigfig=3}} jump was not recognised as Ahonen fell when he landed.

The ''[[Fédération Internationale de Ski]]'' (FIS) [[Ski flying World Championships]] started in 1972 and have been held on a mainly biennial basis, although there have been several occasions where events were held annually. The 2010 FIS World Championships in skiflying were organised in Planica, and in 2012 the FIS World Championships will take place in Vikersund, Norway.

==Notable ski jumpers==
The most notable ski jumpers may be considered those who have managed to show a perfect jump, which means that all five judges attributed the maximum style score of 20 points for their jumps.

So far only 5 jumpers are recorded to have achieved this:

==Water ski jumping==
{{See also|Water skiing}}

The ski jump is performed on two long skis similar to those a beginner uses, with a specialized tailfin that is somewhat shorter and much wider (so it will support the weight of the skier when he is on the jump ramp). Skiers towed behind a boat at fixed speed, maneuver to achieve the maximum speed when hitting a ramp floating in the water, launching themselves into the air with the goal of traveling as far as possible before touching the water. Professional ski jumpers can travel up to {{convert|70|m|ft}}. The skier must successfully land and retain control of the ski rope to be awarded the distance.

An extreme version of this sport named Ski Flying was promoted by Scot Ellis and [[Jim Cara]], in which boat speeds and ramp heights are boosted because physics have proved that the standard {{convert|75|ft|m}} line and traditional {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} boat speed is outrun by the skier and the pro skier was ahead of the boat, being held back by the line.
