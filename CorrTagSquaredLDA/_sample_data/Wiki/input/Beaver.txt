The '''beaver''' ([[genus]] '''''Castor''''') is a primarily [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], large,  [[semi-aquatic]] [[rodent]].  ''Castor'' includes two [[extant taxon|extant]] species, [[North American Beaver]] ''(Castor canadensis)'' (native to [[North America]]) and [[Eurasian Beaver]] ''(Castor fiber)'' ([[Eurasia]]).  Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the [[capybara]]). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline is due to extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because their harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.<ref name="MotW5">Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp.  364–367. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.</ref>

== General ==
Beavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as "lodges") in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float build materials that are difficult to haul over land. They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.
[[File:Beaverbones.jpg|thumb|300px|A beaver skeleton]]
[[Image:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|300px|A beaver [[skeleton]] on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].]]
They are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area.  Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers that can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes.

Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of [[quaking aspen]], [[cottonwood]], [[willow]], [[alder]], [[birch]], [[maple]] and [[cherry]] trees. They also eat sedges, pondweed, and water lilies.<ref>http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/wmh/13_4_7.pdf</ref>

Beavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.

Fossil remains of beavers are found in the peat and other superficial deposits of Britain and the continent of Europe; while in the [[Pleistocene]] formations of Britain and Siberia, occur remains of a giant extinct beaver, ''[[Trogontherium|Trogontherium cuvieri]]'', representing a genus by itself.

Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch.  A beaver's teeth grow continuously so that they are not worn down by chewing on wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beaversolutions.com/about_beaver_biology.asp |title=Beaver Biology |publisher=Beaver Solutions |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>  Their four incisors are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer [[dentin]] on the back.  The chisel-like ends of incisors are maintained by their self-sharpening wear pattern.

Beavers continue to grow throughout life. Adult specimens weighing over {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} are not uncommon. Females are as large or larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon among [[mammal]]s. Beavers live up to 24 years of age in the wild.

=== Etymology ===
The word is descended from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] name of the animal, cf. Sanskrit ''babhru's,'' brown, the great [[Ichneumon (In medieval zoology)|ichneumon]], [[Latin|Lat.]] ''fiber,'' [[German language|Ger.]] ''Biber,'' [[Russian language|Russ.]] ''bobr;'' the root ''bhru'' has given "[[brown]]", and, through [[Romance languages|Romanic]], "[[bronze]]" and "[[burnish]]".<ref name="EB11">''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th Ed.</ref>

== Species ==
They are the only [[extant taxon|extant]] members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Castoridae]], which contains a single [[genus]], '''''Castor'''''. [[genetics|Genetic]] [[research]] has shown the European and North American beaver populations to be distinct species and that [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization is unlikely. Beavers are closely related to [[squirrel]]s (Sciuridae), agreeing in certain structural peculiarities of the lower jaw and skull. In the Sciuridae the two main bones (tibia and fibula) of the lower half of the leg are quite separate, the tail is round and hairy, and the habitats are arboreal and terrestrial. In the beavers or Castoridae these bones are in close contact at their lower ends, the tail is depressed, expanded and scaly, and their habitats are aquatic.<ref name="EB11" />

[[File:beaver tracks.jpg|thumb|400px|North American beaver tracks]]
Although superficially similar to each other, there are several important differences between the two species. Eurasian beavers tend to be bigger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. Eurasian beavers have longer nasal bones than their North American cousins, with the widest point being at the end of the snout for the fomer, and in the middle for the latter. The nasal opening for the Eurasian species is triangular, unlike that of the North American race which is square. The ''[[foramen magnum]]'' is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, and triangular in the North American. The [[anal gland]]s of the Eurasian beaver are larger and thin-walled with a large internal volume compared to that of the North American breed. Finally, the guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tips. Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats. In North American beavers,50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.<ref name="andy">{{cite book |author=Kitchener, Andrew |url= |title=Beavers |year=2001 |isbn=1-873580-55-X |page=144 |publisher=Whittet |location=Stowmarket }}</ref>

The two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 [[chromosomes]], while Eurasian beavers have 48. Also, more than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.<ref name="andy" />

=== Eurasian Beaver ===
{{Main|Eurasian Beaver}}

[[File:Beaver pho34.jpg|thumb|A European Beaver]]
The Eurasian Beaver (''Castor fiber'') was nearly hunted to [[extinction]] in Europe, both for fur and for ''[[castoreum]]'', a secretion of its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the [[Elbe]], the [[Rhone River|Rhone]] and in parts of [[Scandinavia]]. A thriving community lives in northeast [[Poland]], and the Eurasian Beaver also returned to the [[Morava River]] banks in [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. They have been [[reintroduction|reintroduced]] in Scotland ([[Knapdale]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/26/endangeredspecies.conservation |title=Beavers returning to UK after 400 years | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Severin | last=Carrell | date=2008-05-26 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Netherlands]], [[Serbia]] ([[Zasavica]] bog), [[Denmark]] (West [[Jutland]]) and [[Bulgaria]] and are spreading to new locations. The beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century: [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported in 1188 (''Itinerarium'' ii.iii) that it was to be found only in the [[Teifi]] in Wales and in one river in Scotland, though his observations are clearly second hand. In October 2005, six Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in [[Gloucestershire]]; in July 2007 a colony of four Eurasian beavers was established at [[Martin Mere]] in [[Lancashire]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/6291260.stm |title=Beavers are back after 500 years |date=2007-07-11 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and a trial re-introduction occurred in Scotland in May 2009. Feasibility studies for a reintroduction to Wales are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beavers to the wild in England has recently been published.<ref>[http://www.msn.co.uk/htx/returnofthebeaver/ Return of the Beavers at MSN.co.uk]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7158210.stm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080206025535/http://www.msn.co.uk/htx/returnofthebeaver/| archivedate=2008-02-06 |publisher=BBC |title=Beavers could be released in 2009 |date=2007-12-24}}</ref>

=== North American Beaver ===
{{Main|North American Beaver}}
[[File:Castor canadensis.jpg|thumb|A North American Beaver]]
The North American Beaver ''(Castor canadensis)'', also called the Canadian Beaver (which is also the name of a subspecies), American Beaver, or simply Beaver in North America, is native to Canada, much of the United States and parts of northern Mexico. The chief feature distinguishing ''C. canadensis'' from '' C. fiber'' is the form of the nasal bones of the skull.<ref name="EB11" />  This species was introduced to the Argentine and Chilean Tierra del Fuego, as well as Finland, France, Poland and Russia.

The North American beaver's preferred food is the water-lily (''[[Nuphar luteum]]''), which bears a resemblance to a cabbage-stalk, and grows at the bottom of lakes and rivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beaversww.org/beaver.html |title=The Beaver (Castor canadensis) |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-05-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430104013/http://www.beaversww.org/beaver.html |archivedate = 2008-04-30}}</ref> Beavers also gnaw the bark of [[birch]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]] trees; but during the summer a more varied herbage, with the addition of berries, is consumed.
These animals are often trapped for their fur. During the early 19th century, trapping eliminated this animal from large portions of its original range. However, through trap and transfer and habitat conservation it made a nearly complete recovery by the 1940s. Beaver reintroduction in British Columbia was facilitated by Eric Collier as recounted in his book ''Three Against the Wilderness.''  Beaver furs were used to make clothing and top-hats. Much of the early exploration of North America was driven by the quest for this animal's fur.<ref>[http://www.mountainsofstone.com/oregon_country.htm Manifest Destiny: The Oregon Country and Westward Expansion]</ref><ref>{{cite book

Beavers are commonly hosts to [[Giardia lamblia]], the cause of [[giardiasis]]; thus even pristinely-appearing waters of a beaver habitat and its effluent have to be considered contaminated and need to be treated for human consumption.<ref>{{cite book |author=Drisdelle R |title=Parasites.

== Habitat ==
[[File:BeaverSwimming.JPG|thumb|right|Beaver swimming]]
The habitat of the beaver is the [[riparian zone]], inclusive of stream bed. The actions of beavers for hundreds of thousands of years in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] have kept these watery systems healthy and in good repair, although a human observing all the downed trees might think that the beavers were doing just the opposite.

The beaver works as a [[keystone species]] in an [[ecosystem]] by creating [[wetlands]] that are used by many other species. Next to humans, no other extant animal appears to do more to shape its landscape.<ref>Beaver. In ''Animals''. Retrieved June 15, 2009, from http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/beaver.html (beavers second only to humans in their ability to manipulate and change their environment)</ref>

Beavers fell trees for several reasons. They fell large mature trees, usually in strategic locations, to form the basis of a dam, but European beavers tend to use small diameter (<10&nbsp;cm) trees for this purpose. Beavers fell small trees, especially young second-growth trees, for food. Broadleaved trees re-grow as a [[coppice]], providing easy-to-reach stems and leaves for food in subsequent years. Ponds created by beavers can also kill some tree species by drowning but this creates standing dead wood, which is very important for a wide range of animals and plants.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Dams ===
{{Main|Beaver dam}}
[[File:Beaver signs.JPG|thumb|left|These trees, up to {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, were felled by beavers in one night.]]
Beaver dams are created as a protection against predators, such as coyotes, wolves and bears, and to provide easy access to food during winter. Beavers always work at night and are prolific builders, carrying mud and stones with their fore-paws and timber between their teeth. Because of this, destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers is difficult, especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge. Beavers can rebuild such primary dams overnight, though they may not defend secondary dams as vigorously. (Beavers may create a series of dams along a river.)

==== Lodges ==== <!-- This is a section-redirect for [[Beaver lodge]] -->
[[File:Beaverlodge.JPG|thumb|Beaver lodge, approx. {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter. [[Ontario, Canada]]]]

The ponds created by well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' homes, their ''lodges'', which are created from severed branches and mud. The beavers cover their lodges late every autumn with fresh mud, which freezes when the frost sets in. The mud becomes almost as hard as stone, and neither [[Gray Wolf|wolves]] nor [[wolverine]]s can penetrate it.

The lodge has underwater entrances to make entry nearly impossible for any other animal (however, [[muskrats]] have been seen living inside beaver lodges with the beavers who made them).<ref>''The Life of Mammals'' Episode 4, "Chisellers".</ref>  A very small amount of the lodge is actually used as a living area. Contrary to popular belief, beavers actually dig out their dens with underwater entrances after they finish building the dams and lodge structures. There are typically two dens within the lodge, one for drying off after exiting the water, and another, drier one where the family actually lives.
[[File:Beaver lodge.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of lodge]]
Beaver houses are formed of the same materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure, and seldom contain more than four adult and six or eight young beavers. Some of the larger houses have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of the main building left by the builders to support the roof, for the apartments usually have no communication with each other except by water.

When the ice breaks up in spring beavers always leave their embankments and rove about until just before fall, when they return to their old habitations and lay in their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to repair the houses until the frost sets in, and never finish the outer coating until the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new habitation they fell the wood early in summer, but seldom begin building until nearly the end of August.

=== Invasiveness ===
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|Beaver dam in [[Tierra del Fuego]]]]
Beavers often modify their natural environment by building dams, and are therefore considered as pests or [[invasive species]] in some places. For example, in the 1940s, beavers were brought to the island and province of [[Tierra Del Fuego]] in southern [[Argentina]] for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and a few pairs of beavers were released into the wild. They quickly spread throughout the island, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. As the habitat is not adapted to withstand the impact of beavers (e.g., unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, trees native to Tierra del Fuego do not [[coppice]]), beavers have had a detrimental impact. They are now considered a serious invasive species on the island, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their eradication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/NATURE/9907/09/argentina.beaver/ |title=Argentina eager to rid island of beavers|publisher=CNN|date=1999-07-09 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

Both beaver [[testicles]] and [[castoreum]], a bitter-tasting secretion with a slightly fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine.  [[Yupik]] ([[Eskimo]]) medicine used dried beaver testicles like willow bark to relieve pain. Beaver testicles were exported from [[Levant]] (a region centered on [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]]) from the tenth to nineteenth century.<ref>PMID 12576209</ref>  [[Claudius Aelianus]] comically described beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's testicles are inside its body.  European beavers (''[[Castor fiber]]'') were eventually hunted nearly to extinction in part for the production of castoreum, which was used as an [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and [[antipyretic]].  Castoreum was described in the 1911 [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] for use in [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[hysterical]] conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising [[blood pressure]] and increasing [[cardiac output]].  The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of [[salicin]] from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to [[salicylic acid]] and has an action very similar to aspirin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/2005/03/28/S31/1/ |title=The quest for pain relief: how much have we improved on the past? |author=Stephen Pincock |date=2005-03-28 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>  Castoreum continues to be used in [[perfume]] production.

In wider culture, the beaver is famed for its industriousness. The English verb "to beaver" means to work hard and constantly. 
=== As a national emblem ===
The importance of the Beaver in the development of Canada through the fur trade led to its designation as the [[List of national animals|national animal]]. It is depicted on the [[Nickel (Canadian coin)|Canadian five-cent piece]] and was on the first pictorial postage stamp issued in the [[British North America|Canadian colonies]] in 1849 (the so-called "[[Postage stamps and postal history of Canada|Three-Penny Beaver]]"). As a [[national symbol]], the beaver was chosen to be the mascot of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Montreal]] with the name "Amik" ("beaver" in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]). The beaver is also the symbol of many units and organizations within the [[Canadian Forces]], such as on the cap badges of the [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> Régiment]] and the [[Canadian Military Engineers]]. [[Toronto Police Services]], [[London Police Service]], [[Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] crest bears the beaver on their crest or coat of arms.

In the 17th century, based on a question raised by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ruled that the beaver was a [[fish]] (beaver flesh was a  part of the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law.  Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of [[meat]] on Fridays during [[Lent]] did not apply to beaver meat.<ref>[http://www.chowdc.org/Papers/Saunders%202001.html ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmyakin.org/2005/02/lent_roundup.html |title=Lenten Reader Roundup |publisher=Jimmy Akin.Org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{fr icon}}Lacoursière, Jacques. ''Une histoire du Québec'' ISBN 2-89448-050-4 Explains that Bishop François de Laval in the 17th century posed the question to the theologians of the [[Sorbonne]], who ruled in favour of this decision.</ref>  The legal basis for the decision probably rests with the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]], which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3147.htm ''The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas''] II. 147:8 provides legal foundation upon which theologians argued in favour of beaver being like fish.</ref>  This is similar to the Church's classification of the [[capybara]], another semi-aquatic rodent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/in-days-before-easter-venezuelans-tuck-into/11063/ |title=In Days Before Easter, Venezuelans Tuck Into Rodent-Related Delicacy |publisher=The New York Sun|date=2005-03-24 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

=== In computer science ===
In [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], a ''[[busy beaver]]'' (from the colloquial expression for "industrious person") is a [[Turing machine]] that attains the maximum "operational busyness" (such as measured by the number of steps performed, or the number of nonblank symbols finally on the tape) among all the Turing machines in a certain class.

== Trapping ==
Beavers have been trapped for millennia, and this continues to this day.<ref name="myfoxchicago.com">{{cite news |title=Park District Kills Beaver in Lincoln Park |author= |date=April, 2009 |newspaper=MyFoxChicago.com  |url=http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/beaver_north_pond_apr09 |accessdate=Dec. 4, 2009 }}</ref> Beaver pelts were used for [[barter (economics)|barter]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the 17th century to gain European goods. They were then shipped back to Great Britain and [[France]] where they were made into clothing items. Widespread hunting and trapping of beavers led to their [[endangered species|endangerment]]. Eventually, the [[fur trade]] declined due to decreasing demand in Europe and the takeover of trapping grounds to support the growing agriculture sector. A small resurgence in beaver trapping has occurred in some areas where there is an over-population of beaver; trapping is done when the fur is of value, and the remainder of the animal may be used as feed. In the 1976/1977 season, 500,000 beaver pelts were harvested in North America.<ref>Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp. 638. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.</ref> <!--The only fur in North America which surpassing the beaver's in commercial value was that of the silver morph [[red fox]], which was said to be forty times more valuable.<ref name="NEC">{{cite book |author=Morton, Thomas |title=New English Canaan: Or, New Canaan (Research Library of Colonial Americana) |year=1972 |pages=188 |isbn=0405033095 |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York}}</ref> What period was this??  Does this include domesticated animals ?? -->
