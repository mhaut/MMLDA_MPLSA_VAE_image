'''North Korea''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-North Korea.ogg|icon|ˈ|n|ɔr|θ|_|k|ə|ˌ|r|i|ə}}), officially the '''Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' ('''DPRK'''; [[Hangul|Chosongul]]: 조선민주주의인민공화국), is a country in [[East Asia]], occupying the northern half of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Pyongyang]]. The [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] serves as the [[buffer zone]] between North Korea and [[South Korea]]. The [[Yalu River|Amnok River]] and the [[Tumen River]] form the border between North Korea and the [[People's Republic of China]]. A section of the Tumen River in the extreme northeast is the border with [[Russia]].

The peninsula was governed by the [[Korean Empire]] until it was annexed by [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japan]] following the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905. It was [[Division of Korea|divided]] into Soviet and American occupied zones in 1945, following the end of [[World War II]]. North Korea refused to participate in a [[United Nations]]–supervised election held in the south in 1948, which led to the creation of separate Korean governments for the two occupation zones. Both North and South Korea claimed [[sovereignty]] over the Korean Peninsula as a whole, which led to the [[Korean War]] of 1950. The [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement of 1953]] ended the fighting; however, the two countries are officially still at war with each other, as a peace treaty was never signed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,528320,00.html|title=U.S.: N.

| quote=Kim Jong-il's regime needs economic concessions to avoid collapse, and just as crucially needs an end to the strategic siege imposed by the US since the end of the Korean war (1950–53). Pyongyang's nuclear brinkmanship, though potentially dangerous, is driven by fear rather than by militaristic ambition. The rotten Stalinist dictatorship faces the prospect of an implosion. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which deprived North Korea of vital economic support, the regime has consistently attempted to secure from the US a non-aggression pact, recognition of its sovereignty, and economic assistance. The US's equally consistent refusal to enter into direct negotiations with North Korea, effectively ruling out a peace treaty to formally close the 1950–53 Korean war, has encouraged the regime to resort to nuclear blackmail.

== History ==
{{Main|History of North Korea}}
{{See also|History of Korea}}
In the aftermath of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]] which ended with Japan's defeat in [[World War II]] in 1945, Korea was divided at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] in accordance with a [[United Nations]] arrangement, to be administered by the [[Soviet Union]] in the north and the [[United States]] in the south. The history of North Korea formally begins with the establishment of the Democratic [[People's Republic]] in 1948.

=== Division of Korea ===
{{Main|Division of Korea}}
In August 1945, the [[Soviet Army]] established a Soviet Civil Authority to rule the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula until a domestic regime, friendly to the USSR, could be established. This became governed by the [[Provisional People's Committee for North Korea]] through 1948. After the Soviet forces' departure in 1948, the main agenda in the following years was unification of Korea until the consolidation of [[Syngman Rhee]] regime in the South with American military support and the suppression of the October 1948 insurrection ended hopes that the country could be reunified by way of [[Communist]] revolution in the South.
In 1949, a military intervention into [[South Korea]] was considered by Kim Il-sung, but failed to receive support from the Soviet Union, which had played a key role in the establishment of the country.<ref name=Cumings1981>Bruce Cummings, ''The Origins of the Korean War, Vol. 1: Liberation and the Emergence of Separate Regimes, 1945–1947'', Princeton University Press</ref>

The withdrawal of most [[United States]] forces from the South in June dramatically weakened the [[Syngman Rhee|Southern regime]] and encouraged Kim Il-sung to re-think an invasion plan against the South.<ref name="Cumings1981" /> The idea itself was first rejected by [[Joseph Stalin]] but with the development of Soviet nuclear weapons, [[Mao Zedong]]'s victory in China and the Chinese indication that it would send troops and other support to North Korea, Stalin approved an invasion which led to the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Martin | first = Bradley K. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty | publisher = Thomas Dunne Books + | year = 2004 | location = New York, NY | pages = 66–67 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-312-32322-0}}</ref>

The Korean War was a war between North Korea and South Korea with major hostilities beginning on June 25, 1950, ending with [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|an armistice]] signed on July 27, 1953. The conflict arose from the division of Korea by the UN and the attempts of the two Korean powers to reunify [[Korea]] under their respective governments. The division led to full scale civil war with a cost of more than 2 million civilians and soldiers from both sides. The period immediately before the war was marked by escalating border conflicts at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] and attempts to negotiate elections for the entirety of Korea.<ref name="TruceTent">{{Cite book| last =Hermes, Jr. | first =Walter | title =Truce Tent and Fighting Front | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |year=1992| origyear = 1966| id = CMH Pub 20-3-1 | pages =2, 6, 9 | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/truce/fm.htm}}</ref>

These negotiations ended when the [[military of North Korea]] invaded the South on June 25, 1950. Under the aegis of the [[United Nations]], nations allied with the [[United States]] intervened on behalf of South Korea. After rapid advances in a South Korean counterattack, North-allied [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war and ultimately leading to an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea.

While some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, there were many other factors at play.<ref name="AMH">{{Cite book| chapter = The Korean War, 1950–1953 | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/ | chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/chapter8.htm | title = American Military History, Volume 2 | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2007-08-20 | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| editor = Richard W. Stewart | id = CMH Pub 30-22}}</ref> The Korean War was also the first armed confrontation of the [[Cold War]] and set the standard for many later conflicts. It created the idea of a [[proxy war]], where the two [[superpower]]s would fight in another country, forcing the people in that nation to suffer the bulk of the destruction and death involved in a war between such large nations. The superpowers avoided [[Limited war|descending into an all-out war]] with one another, as well as the mutual use of [[nuclear weapons]]. It also expanded the Cold War, which to that point had mostly been concerned with Europe. A heavily guarded [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|demilitarized zone]] on the 38th parallel continues to divide the peninsula today with anti-Communist and anti-North Korea sentiment still remaining in South Korea.

Since the Armistice in 1953, the relations between the North Korean government and South Korea, the European Union, Canada, the United States, and Japan have remained tense and hostile incidents occur frequently.<ref>Casey, Steven (2008).

=== Late 20th century ===
{{Main|Korean Demilitarized Zone}}
The relative peace between the south and the north was punctuated by border skirmishes and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders, most notably in 1968, 1974 and the [[Rangoon bombing]] in 1983; tunnels were frequently found under the DMZ and war nearly broke out over the [[Axe Murder Incident]] at [[Panmunjeom]] in 1976.<ref>Kirkbride, Wayne (1984).

In the late 1990s, with the South having transitioned to [[liberal democracy]], the success of the [[Nordpolitik]] policy, and power in the North having been taken up by Kim Il-sung's son [[Kim Jong-il]], the two nations began to engage publicly for the first time, with the South declaring its [[Sunshine Policy]].<ref>Kwak, Tae-Hwan; Joo, Seung-Ho (2003).

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of North Korea}}
[[File:PaektuDPRK.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lake [[Heaven Lake|Ch'ŏnji]] at [[Mount Paektu]], North Korea's highest point]]
North Korea occupies the northern portion of the [[Korean Peninsula]], lying between latitudes [[37th parallel north|37°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43°N]], and longitudes [[124th meridian east|124°]] and [[131st meridian east|131°E]]. It covers an area of {{convert|120540|km2|sqmi|0}}. North Korea shares land borders with People's Republic of China and Russia to the north, and borders South Korea along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. To its west are the [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Korea Bay]], and to its east lies Japan across the [[Sea of Japan]] (East Sea of Korea). The highest point in North Korea is [[Baekdu Mountain|Paektu-san Mountain]] at {{convert|2744|m|ft|0}}. The longest river is the Amnok River which flows for {{convert|790|km|mi|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Jta/Kr/KrGEO0.htm |title=Korea Geography |accessdate=2007-08-01 |author=Caraway, Bill |year=2007 |work=The Korean History Project }}</ref>

[[File:North Korea Topography.png|thumb|250px|right|Topography of North Korea.]]

The capital and largest city is [[Pyongyang]]; other major cities include [[Kaesong]] in the south, [[Sinuiju]] in the northwest, [[Wonsan]] and [[Hamhung]] in the east and [[Chongjin]] in the northeast.

=== Topography ===
{{See|Korean Peninsula}}
Early [[Europe]]an visitors to Korea remarked that the country resembled "a sea in a heavy gale" because of the many successive [[mountain range]]s that crisscross the peninsula.<ref name="Topography">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0030)|title=Topography and Drainage|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-08-17|date=1993-06-01}}</ref> Some 80% of North Korea is composed of [[mountain]]s and [[Highland (geography)|uplands]], separated by deep and narrow [[valley]]s, with all of the peninsula's mountains with elevations of {{convert|2000|m|ft|spell=us}} or more located in North Korea. The coastal [[plain]]s are wide in the west and discontinuous in the east. A great majority of the population lives in the plains and [[lowland]]s.

The highest point in North Korea is [[Baekdu Mountain]] which is a [[volcano|volcanic mountain]] near the Chinese border with [[basalt]] [[lava]] [[plateau]] with elevations between {{convert|1400|and|2000|m|ft|spell=us}} above sea level.<ref name="Topography" /> The [[Hamgyong Range]], located in the extreme northeastern part of the peninsula, has many high peaks including [[Gwanmosan]] at approximately {{convert|1756|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Other major ranges include the [[Rangrim Mountains]], which are located in the north-central part of North Korea and run in a north-south direction, making communication between the eastern and western parts of the country rather difficult; and the [[Kangnam Mountains|Kangnam]] Range, which runs along the North Korea–China border. [[Geumgangsan]], often written Mt Kumgang, or Diamond Mountain, (approximately {{convert|1638|m|ft|disp=or}}) in the [[Taebaek Mountains|Taebaek Range]], which extends into South Korea, is famous for its scenic beauty.<ref name="Topography" />

For the most part, the plains are small. The most extensive are the [[Pyongyang]] and [[Chaeryong]] plains, each covering about {{convert|500|km2|sqmi|spell=us}}. Because the mountains on the east coast drop abruptly to the sea, the plains are even smaller there than on the west coast. Unlike neighboring Japan or northern China, North Korea experiences few severe [[earthquake]]s.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of North Korea}}
North Korea has a [[continental climate]] with four distinct seasons.<ref name="climate">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0031) |title=North Korea Country Studies. Climate |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> Long winters bring bitter cold and clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from [[Siberia]]. Average snowfall is 37 days during the winter. The weather is likely to be particularly harsh in the northern, mountainous regions.

Summer tends to be short, hot, humid, and rainy because of the southern and southeastern [[monsoon]] winds that bring moist air from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Typhoons affect the peninsula on an average of at least once every summer.<ref name="climate" /> Spring and autumn are transitional seasons marked by mild temperatures and variable winds and bring the most pleasant weather. Natural hazards include late spring droughts which often are followed by severe flooding. There are occasional [[typhoon]]s during the early fall.

North Korea's climate is relatively [[temperate]]. Most of the country is classified as type ''Dwa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]] scheme, with warm summers and cold, dry winters. In summer there is a short rainy season called ''changma''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/21.htm |title=North Korea - Climate |accessdate=2007-08-01 |author=[[Federal Research Division]] of the US [[Library of Congress]] |year=2007 |work=Country Studies }}</ref> On August 7, 2007, the most devastating [[2007 North Korea flooding|floods]] in 40 years caused the North Korean government to ask for international help. [[NGO]]s, such as the [[Red Cross]], asked people to raise funds because they feared a humanitarian catastrophe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/Docs/News/pr07/4607.asp |title="Emergency appeal for DPRK flood survivors", website of the Red Cross |publisher=Ifrc.org |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>

North Korea shares its traditional culture with [[South Korea]], but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Historically, while the culture of Korea has been influenced by that of neighbouring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique and distinct cultural identity from its larger neighbour.<ref name="Fairbank et al.">{{Cite book|author=John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer & Albert M. Craig|title=East Asia: Tradition & Transformation|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston|year=1978|isbn=039525812X}}</ref>

Literature and arts in North Korea are state-controlled, mostly through the Propaganda and Agitation Department or the Culture and Arts Department of the Central Committee of the KWP.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0051) North Korea - Contemporary Cultural Expression], Country Studies.</ref>

Korean culture came under attack during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] from 1910 to 1945. Japan enforced a [[cultural assimilation]] policy. During the Japanese rule, Koreans were encouraged to learn and speak Japanese, adopt the Japanese family name system and [[Shinto]] religion, and forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools, businesses, or public places.<ref>{{Cite book| url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/kptoc.html | chapter=The Rise of Korean Nationalism and Communism | first=Bruce G. | last=Cumings | title=A Country Study: North Korea | publisher=Library of Congress | id=Call number DS932 .N662 1994}}</ref> In addition, the Japanese altered or destroyed various Korean monuments including [[Gyeongbokgung|Gyeongbok Palace]] and documents which portrayed the Japanese in a negative light were revised.

In July 2004, the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs]] became the first site in the country to be included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.

A popular event in North Korea is the [[Mass Games]]. The most recent and largest Mass Games was called "[[Arirang Festival|Arirang]]". It was performed six nights a week for two months, and involved over 100,000 performers. Attendees to this event in recent years report that the anti-West sentiments have been toned down compared to previous performances. The Mass Games involve performances of dance, gymnastics, and [[choreography|choreographic]] routines which celebrate the history of North Korea and the Workers' Party Revolution. The Mass Games are held in Pyongyang at various venues (varying according to the scale of the Games in a particular year) including the [[Rungrado May Day Stadium]], which is the largest stadium in the world with a capacity of 150,000 people.

North Korea has long maintained close relations with the People's Republic of China and Russia. The [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in eastern Europe in 1989, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, resulted in a devastating drop in aid to North Korea from Russia, although China continues to provide substantial assistance. North Korea continues to have strong ties with its [[socialism|socialist]] southeast Asian allies in [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]], as well as with [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/165th_issue/2001072510.htm |title=Kim Yong Nam Visits 3 ASEAN Nations To Strengthen Traditional Ties |accessdate=2007-08-01 |year=2001 |work=The People's Korea }}</ref>
North Korea has started installing a [[Chinese–Korean border fence|concrete and barbed wire fence]] on its northern border, in response to China's wish to curb refugees fleeing from North Korea.

As a result of the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korean nuclear weapons program]], the [[Six-party talks]] were established to find a peaceful solution to the growing tension between the two Korean governments, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the United States.

North Korea has an industrialised, near-[[autarky|autarkic]], highly centralized [[command economy]]. Of the five remaining Communist states in the world, North Korea is one of only two (along with [[Cuba]]) with an almost entirely government-planned, state-owned economy.

{{Main|Tourism in North Korea}}
[[File:Lake-samilpo-at-geumgangsan.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kŭmgangsan Tourist Region]] was popular among South Korean tourists until its suspension in 2008]]

Tourism in North Korea is organized by the state owned Korea International Travel Company. Every group of travelers as well as individual tourists/visitors is permanently accompanied by one or two "guides" who normally speak the mother language of the tourist. While tourism has increased over the last few years, tourists from Western countries remain few.

The majority of the tourists who visit come from China, Russia, and Japan. Russian citizens from the Asian part of Russia prefer North Korea as a tourist destination due to the relatively low prices, lack of pollution and the warmer climate. For citizens of South Korea, it is practically impossible to obtain a [[visa (document)|visa]] for North Korea; however, they can still obtain "entry permits" to special tourist areas designated for South Koreans, such as Kaesong. US citizens were also subject to visa restrictions, only able to visit during the yearly [[Arirang Festival]]. These restrictions were lifted in January 2010, yet currently fewer than 2,500 U.S. citizens have visited North Korea since 1953.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Chris |url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/none/north-korea-lifts-travel-restrictions-americans-529062 |title=Visit anytime!

In the area of the [[Kŭmgangsan]]-mountains, the company [[Hyundai]] established and operates a special Tourist area. Traveling to this area is also possible for South Koreans and US citizens, but only in organized groups from South Korea. A special administrative region known as the [[Kŭmgangsan Tourist Region]] exists for this purpose. However, trips to the region were suspended after a South Korean woman who wandered into a controlled military zone was shot dead by border guards in late 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=S Korea hopes DPRK to begin dialogue over S Korean tourist shot dead|publisher=chinaview.cn|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/10/content_11686216.htm/|accessdate=2009-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> When tours had still not resumed by May 2010, North Korea unilaterally announced that it would seize South Korean real estate assets in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/04/09/2010040900476.html |title=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition): Daily News from Korea - N.Korea Seizes S.Korean Property in Mt.

In the 1990s North Korea faced significant economic disruptions, including a series of natural disasters, economic mismanagement and serious resource shortages after the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. These resulted in a shortfall of staple [[Cereal|grain]] output of more than 1 million tons from what the country needs to meet internationally accepted minimum dietary requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/49.htm |title=North Korea - Agriculture |accessdate=2007-08-01 |author=[[Federal Research Division]] of the US [[Library of Congress]] |year=2007 |work=Country Studies }}</ref> The [[North Korean famine]] known as "Arduous March" resulted in the deaths of between 300,000 and 800,000 North Koreans per year during the three year famine, peaking in 1997.<ref name="famine">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9808/19/nkorea.famine/ |title=Famine may have killed 2 million in North Korea |accessdate=2007-08-01 |author=Lee, May |date=1998-08-19 |work=[[CNN]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070209071653/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9808/19/nkorea.famine/| archivedate = February 9, 2007}}</ref> The deaths were most likely caused by famine-related illnesses such as [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[diarrhea]] rather than [[starvation]].<ref name="famine" />

In 2006, [[Amnesty International]] reported that a national nutrition survey conducted by the North Korean government, the [[World Food Programme]], and [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] found that 7% of children were severely [[malnutrition|malnourished]]; 37% were chronically malnourished; 23.4% were underweight; and one in three mothers was malnourished and [[anemia|anaemic]] as the result of the lingering effect of the famine. The inflation caused by some of the 2002 economic reforms, including the Songun or [[Songun|"Military-first" policy]], was cited for creating the increased price of basic foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/prk-summary-eng |title=Asia-Pacific : North Korea |accessdate=2007-08-01 |year=2007 |work=[[Amnesty International]] }}</ref>

The history of Japanese assistance to North Korea has been marked with challenges; from a large pro-[[Pyongyang]] community of Koreans in Japan to public outrage over the 1998 North Korean missile launch and revelations regarding the abduction of Japanese citizens.<ref name="haggard">Haggard Stephan; Marcus Noland (2007). ''Ch6 The political economy of aid: Famine in North Korea''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 137.<!--Insert footnote text here--></ref> In June 1995 an agreement was reached that the two countries would act jointly.<ref name="haggard" /> South Korea would provide 150,000 MT of grain in unmarked bags, and Japan would provide 150,000 MT gratis and another 150,000 MT on concessional terms.<ref name="haggard" /> In October 1995 and January 1996, North Korea again approached Japan for assistance. On these two occasions, both of which came at crucial moments in the evolution of the famine, opposition from both South Korea and domestic political sources quashed the deals.<ref name="haggard" />

Beginning in 1997, the U.S. began shipping food aid to North Korea through the United Nations [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) to combat the famine. Shipments peaked in 1999 at nearly 700,000 tons making the U.S. the largest foreign aid donor to the country at the time. Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]], aid was drastically reduced year after year from 350,000 tons in 2001 to 40,000 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/hunger/relief/2005/0520nkorea.htm |title=US Has Put Food Aid for North Korea on Hold |accessdate=2007-08-01 |author=Solomon, Jay |date=2005-05-20 |work=Wall Street Journal }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The Bush Administration took criticism for using "food as a weapon" during talks over the North's nuclear weapons program, but insisted the [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) criteria were the same for all countries and the situation in North Korea had "improved significantly since its collapse in the mid-1990s."

== Media and communications ==
{{Main|Media of North Korea|Telecommunications in North Korea}}

=== Media ===
The media of North Korea are under one of the most strict government controls in the world. The North Korean constitution provides for [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]]; however, the government prohibits the exercise of these rights in practice. In its 2010 report, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked the freedom of the press in North Korea as 177th out of 178, above only that of [[Eritrea]].<ref name=rwb>[http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&id_rubrique=1034 Annual Press Freedom Index].

=== Telephones and Internet ===
North Korea has an adequate telephone system, with 1.18 million fixed lines available in 2008.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2150rank.html?countryName=Korea, North&countryCode=kn&regionCode=eas&rank=70#kn Country Comparison :: Telephones - main lines in use], CIA - The World Factbook</ref>

North Korea's first [[Internet café]] opened in 2002 as a joint venture with South Korean internet company Hoonnet. Ordinary North Koreans do not have access to the global Internet network, but are provided with a nationwide, public use Intranet service called ''[[Kwangmyong (network)|Kwangmyong]]'', which features domestic news, an [[e-mail]] service and censored information from foreign websites (mostly scientific).<ref>{{Cite news|title=North Korea's IT revolution

Two of the few ways to enter North Korea are over the [[Sino-Korea Friendship Bridge]] or via [[Panmunjeom]], the former crossing the [[Yalu River|Amnok River]] and the latter crossing the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]].

Private cars in North Korea are a rare sight, but {{As of|2008|lc=on}} some 70% of households used [[bicycle]]s, which also play an increasingly important role in small-scale private trade.<ref>[http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&num=4230 70% of Households Use Bikes], The Daily NK, 2008-10-30</ref> Very few cars and light trucks are made in a joint-venture between [[Pyonghwa|Pyeonghwa Motors]] of South Korea, and the North Korean [[Ryonbong|Ryonbong General Corp]] at a facility in [[Nampo]] North Korea.<ref>{{Cite news|last=  |first= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167008653.html |title=PYEONGHWA MOTORS, CHINA'S BRILLIANCE IN TALKS TO PRODUCE TRUCKS. |publisher=AsiaPulse News |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref> Another local producer of vehicles is [[Sungri Motor Plant]], which manufactures civilian vehicles and heavy trucks.

There is a mix of locally built and imported trolleybuses and trams in urban centers in North Korea. Earlier fleets were obtained in Europe and China, but the trade embargo has forced North Korea to build their own vehicles.

=== Rail transport ===
[[File:Dai Hong Dan.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A North Korean cargo ship off the coast of Somalia]]
Choson Cul Minzuzui Inmingonghoagug is the only rail operator in North Korea. It has a network of {{convert|5200|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track with {{convert|4500|km|mi|abbr=on}} in [[standard gauge]].<ref name="A Glimpse of North Korea's Railways">{{cite web|url=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/steam/trains/nkorea04.htm|title=A Glimpse of North Korea's Railways|last=Dickinson|first=Rob|work=The International Steam Pages|accessdate=2009-07-04| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080502142007/http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/steam/trains/nkorea04.htm| archivedate = May 2, 2008}}</ref> There is a small narrow gauge railway in operation in Haeju peninsula.<ref name="A Glimpse of North Korea's Railways" /> The railway fleet consists of a mix of electric and steam locomotives. Cars are mostly made in North Korea using Soviet designs. There are some locomotives from Imperial Japan, the United States, and Europe remaining in use. Second-hand Chinese locomotives (early DF4Bs, BJ Hydraulics, etc.) have also been spotted in active service.

=== Marine transport ===
Water transport on the major rivers and along the coasts plays a growing role in freight and passenger traffic. Except for the Yalu and Taedong rivers, most of the inland waterways, totaling {{convert|2253|km|mi|spell=us}}, are navigable only by small boats. Coastal traffic is heaviest on the eastern seaboard, whose deeper waters can accommodate larger vessels. The major ports are [[Nampho]] on the west coast and [[Rajin]], [[Chongjin]], [[Wonsan]], and [[Hamhung]] on the east coast. The country's harbor loading capacity in the 1990s was estimated at almost 35 million tons a year.

In the early 1990s, North Korea possessed an oceangoing merchant fleet, largely domestically produced, of sixty-eight ships (of at least 1,000 gross-registered tons), totaling 465,801 gross-registered tons ({{DWT|709,442|metric|first=yes}}), which includes fifty-eight cargo ships and two tankers. There is a continuing investment in upgrading and expanding port facilities, developing transportation—particularly on the Taedong River—and increasing the share of international cargo by domestic vessels.

=== Air transport ===
North Korea's international air connections are limited. There are regularly scheduled flights from the [[Sunan International Airport]] – {{convert|24|km|mi|spell=us}} north of Pyongyang – to [[Moscow]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Vladivostok]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beijing]], [[Dalian]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenyang]] along with seasonal services to [[Singapore]] and charter flights from Sunan numerous Asian and European destinations including Tokyo and Nagoya. Regular charters to existing scheduled services are operated as per demand. An agreement to initiate a service between Pyongyang and Tokyo was signed in 1990. Internal flights are available between [[Pyongyang]], [[Hamhung]], [[Haeju]], [[Kaesong]], [[Kanggye]], [[Kilju]], [[Nampo]], [[Sinuiju]], [[Samjiyon]], [[Wonsan]], and [[Chongjin]].

All civil aircraft are operated by [[Air Koryo]]: 38 aircraft in 2010, which  were purchased from the Soviet Union and Russia. From 1976 to 1978, four [[Tu-154]] jets were added to the 7 of propeller-driven An-24s and 2 Ilyushin Il-18's afterwards adding four long range Ilyushin Il-62M, three Ilyushin Il-76MD large cargo aircraft. In 2008 a long range Tupolev Tu-204-300's purchased along with a larger version the Tupolev Tu-204-100B in 2010.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of North Korea}}
[[File:Pyramide Corée du Nord.PNG|thumb|right|225px|[[Population pyramid]] of North Korea]]
North Korea's population of roughly 24 million is one of the most ethnically and linguistically homogeneous in the world, with very small numbers of Chinese, [[Japanese people in North Korea|Japanese]], Vietnamese, South Korean, and European expatriate minorities.

According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], North Korea's life expectancy was 63.8 years in 2009, a figure roughly equivalent to that of [[Pakistan]] and [[Burma]] and slightly lower than Russia.<ref name="Central Intelligence Agency">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Country Comparison :: Life expectancy at birth|year=2009|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> [[Infant mortality]] stood at a high level of 51.3, which is 2.5 times higher than that of [[People's Republic of China|China]], 5 times that of [[Russia]], 12 times that of [[South Korea]].<ref name="cia-2091">{{cite web| title=Infant mortality rate | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html | work=The World Factbook -- Country Comparisons | publisher=CIA |year=2009 | accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref>

=== Language ===
{{Main|Korean language}}
North Korea shares the [[Korean language]] with South Korea. There are dialect differences within both Koreas, but the border between North and South does not represent a major linguistic boundary. While prevalent in the South, the adoption of modern terms from foreign languages has been limited in North Korea. [[Hanja]] ([[Chinese character]]s) are no longer used in North Korea, although still occasionally used in South Korea. Both Koreas share the phonetic writing system called [[Chosongul]] in the north and [[Hangul]] south of the DMZ. The official [[Romanization]] differs in the two countries, with North Korea using a slightly modified [[McCune-Reischauer]] system, and the South using the [[Revised Romanization of Korean]].

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in North Korea}}
Both Koreas share a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] heritage and a recent history of [[Christianity in Korea|Christian]] and [[Cheondoism]] ("religion of the Heavenly Way") movements. The North Korean constitution states that freedom of religion is permitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/061st_issue/98091708.htm|title=DPRK's Socialist Constitution (Full Text)|accessdate=2009-07-04|publisher=The People's Korea|year=1998}}; see Chapter 5, Article 68</ref> According to the Western standards of religion, the majority of the North Korean population could be characterized as irreligious. However, the cultural influence of such traditional religions as Buddhism and Confucianism still have an effect on North Korean spiritual life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/North-Korea.html|title=Culture of North Korea - Alternative name, History and ethnic relations|work=Countries and Their Cultures|publisher=Advameg Inc.|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html#People CIA The World Factbook -- North Korea]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2792.htm|title=Background Note: North Korea|coauthors=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs|date=2009-2|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

[[File:Myogilsang-naegeumgang.jpg|thumb|An ancient relief image of [[the Buddha]], mount Kumgang]]

Nevertheless, Buddhists in North Korea reportedly fare better than other religious groups, particularly Christians, who are said to face persecution by the authorities. Buddhists are given limited funding by the government to promote the religion, because Buddhism played an integral role in traditional Korean culture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/02/world/fg-temple2|title=Buddhist Temple Being Restored in N.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], free religious activities no longer exist in North Korea, as the government sponsors religious groups only to create an illusion of religious freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/07/08/nkorea9040.htm |title=Human Rights in North Korea |accessdate=2007-08-02 |month=July | year=2004 |work=[[Human Rights Watch]] }}</ref>

Primary schools are known as people's schools and children attend this school from the age of six to nine. They are later enrolled in either a regular secondary school or a special secondary school, depending on their specialities. They enter secondary school at the age of ten and leave when they are sixteen.

[[Higher education]] is not compulsory in North Korea. It is composed of two systems: academic higher education and higher education for continuing education. The academic higher education system includes three kinds of institutions: [[university|universities]], [[professional school (disambiguation)|professional school]]s, and [[technical school]]s. [[Graduate school]]s for master's and doctoral level studies are attached to universities, and are for students who want to continue their education.<!--blacklisted link: <ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/1116/North-Korea-HIGHER-EDUCATION.html|title=North Korea - Higher Education|accessdate=2008-11-18|year=|work=State University.com}}</ref>--> Two notable universities in the DPRK are the [[Kim Il-sung University]] and [[Pyongyang University of Science and Technology]], both in [[Pyongyang]]. The former, founded in October 1946, is an elite institution whose enrollment of 16,000 full- and part-time students in the early 1990s occupies, in the words of one observer, the "pinnacle of the North Korean educational and social system."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0059) |title=North Korea - Higher education. |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>

=== Health care ===
[[File:North Korea-Pyongyang Maternity Hospital-04.jpg|thumb|right|A dental cabinet at one of North Korea's major hospitals]]
{{Main|Health Care in North Korea}}

North Korea has a national medical service and health insurance system.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/North_Korea.pdf Library of Congress country study], see p. 8 - Health</ref> North Korea spends 3% of its gross domestic product on health care. Since the 1950s, the DPRK has put great emphasis on healthcare, and between 1955 and 1986, the number of [[hospital]]s grew from 285 to 2,401, and the number of [[clinic]]s – from 1,020 to 5,644.<ref>[http://country-studies.com/north-korea/public-health.html North Korea Public Health], Country Studies</ref> There are hospitals attached to factories and mines. Since 1979 more emphasis has been put on traditional [[Korean medicine]], based on treatment with herbs and [[acupuncture]].

North Korea's healthcare system has been in a steep decline since the 1990s due to natural disasters, economic problems, and food and energy shortages. Many hospitals and clinics in North Korea now lack essential medicines, equipment, running water and electricity.<ref>{{Cite news|title=N Korea healthcare 'near collapse'|work=BBC News|date=2008-11-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1666806.stm}}</ref>

Almost 100% of the population has access to water and sanitation, but it is not completely potable. [[Infectious disease]]s, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B, are considered to be [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rm/2003/21269.htm|title=Life Inside North Korea|accessdate=2008-11-18|work=U.S. Department of State|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080711165256/http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rm/2003/21269.htm|archivedate=July 11, 2008}}</ref> [[Life expectancy]] in North Korea is 63.8 years, occupying the 170th [[List of countries by life expectancy|place in the world]], according to 2009 estimates.<ref name="Central Intelligence Agency" />

Among other health problems, many North Korean citizens suffer from the after effects of [[malnutrition]], caused by famines related to the failure of its food distribution program and "military first" policy. A 1998 United Nations (UN) World Food Program report revealed that 60% of children suffered from malnutrition, and 16% were acutely malnourished. As a result, those who suffered during the disaster have ongoing health problems.

The system changed slightly at the end of 1990s, when population growth became very low. In many cases, where capital punishment was ''de facto''{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, it was replaced by less severe punishments. Bribery became prevalent throughout the country.<ref>Hagard, Stephen and Noland, Marcus [http://www.iie.com/publications/wp/wp10-2.pdf Peterson Institute for International Economics Working Paper 10-2 Economic Crime and Punishment in North Korea] P. 16, March 2010 Retrieved 2010-05-28</ref> For example, years ago{{Specify|date=March 2009}} just listening to South Korean radio could result in capital punishment{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

=== Personality cult ===
The North Korean government exercises control over many aspects of the nation's culture, and this control is used to perpetuate a [[cult of personality]] surrounding Kim Il-sung, and, to a lesser extent, Kim Jong-il. While visiting North Korea in 1979, journalist [[Bradley Martin]] noted that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed [[propaganda|glorified]] "Great Leader" Kim Il-sung, whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, "Dear Leader" Kim Jong-il.<ref name="LovingCare">Bradley K. Martin. ''Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty''. ISBN 0-312-32322-0</ref> There is even widespread belief that Kim Il-sung "created the world", and Kim Jong-il can "control the weather".<ref name="LovingCare" />

[[File:Kim Il-sung.jpg|thumb|175px|left|A propaganda poster with Kim Il-sung's official portrait]]

The song "[[No Motherland Without You]]" (당신이없으면 조국도없다), sung by the North Korean Army Choir, was created especially for Kim Jong-il and is one of the most popular tunes in the country. Kim Il-sung is still officially revered as the nation's "Eternal President". Several landmarks in North Korea are named for Kim Il-sung, including [[Kim Il-sung University]], [[Kim Il-sung Stadium]], and [[Kim Il-sung Square]]. Defectors have been quoted as saying that North Korean schools deify both father and son.<ref>Chol-hwan Kang and Pierre Rigoulot (2005). ''The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag'', Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01104-7</ref> Kim Il-sung rejected the notion that he had created a cult around himself, and accused those who suggested this of "[[Political faction|factionalism]]".<ref name="LovingCare" />

Critics maintain this Kim Jong-il personality cult was inherited from his father, Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-il is often the center of attention throughout ordinary life in the DPRK. His birthday is one of the most important public holidays in the country. On his 60th birthday (based on his official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1823713.stm|title=North Korea marks leader's birthday|publisher=BBC|date=16 February 2002|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref> Kim Jong-il's personality cult, although significant, is not as extensive as his father's.

=== Korean reunification ===
{{Main|Korean reunification}}
North Korea's policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference, through a federal structure retaining each side's leadership and systems. Both North and South Korea signed the [[June 15th North–South Joint Declaration]] in which both sides made promises to seek out a peaceful reunification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcckp.net/en/one/nation.php?1+joint|title="Naenara"-Korea is One-Leader and Nation-June 15 North-South Joint Declaration|date=2000-06-15|work=Naenara|publisher=Korea Computer Center in DPR Korea|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> The Democratic Federal Republic of Korea is a [[proposed state]] first mentioned by then North Korean president Kim Il-sung on October 10, 1980, proposing a federation between North and [[South Korea]] in which the respective political systems would initially remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songunpoliticsstudygroup.org/Oct102008/W-801010.HTM|title=REPORT TO THE SIXTH CONGRESS OF THE WORKERS’ PARTY OF KOREA ON THE WORK OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE|last=Kim|first=Il Sung|date=1980-10-10|publisher=Songun Politics Study Group (USA)|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

Perhaps the most well known sporting event in North Korea is the annual [[Arirang Festival]].  The main attraction of Arirang is the [[mass gymnastics]] display.  In football, fifteen clubs compete in the [[DPR Korea League]] level-one and vie for both the Technical Innovation Contests and the Republic Championship.  The national football team, [[Korea DPR national football team|Chollima]], compete in the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] and are ranked 105 by [[FIFA]] as of 26 May 2010.  The team competed in the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]].  In hockey, North Korea has a [[North Korea men's national ice hockey team|men’s team]] that is ranked 43rd out of 49<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Men's World Ranking|url=http://www.iihf.com/de/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking/mens-world-ranking/2010-ranking.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=24 October 2010}}</ref> and competes in Division II.

North Korea has been competing in the Olympics since [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and debuted at the summer games in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] by taking home five medals, including one gold.  The IOC Code is [[North Korea at the Olympics|PRK]].  At the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]] Games in 2004, the North and South marched together in the opening and closing ceremonies under the [[Unification Flag]], but competed separately. North Korea has medaled in every Olympics they have participated in.

The [[martial arts|martial art]] [[taekwondo]] originated in Korea. In the 1950s and 60s, modern rules were standardised and taekwondo became an official [[Olympic Games|Olympic sport]] in 2000. Other Korean martial arts include [[taekkyeon]], [[hapkido]], [[tang soo do]], [[kuk sool won]], [[kumdo]] and [[subak]].
