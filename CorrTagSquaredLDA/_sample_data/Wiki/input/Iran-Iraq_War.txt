The '''Iran–Iraq War''', also known as the '''Imposed War''' (جنگ تحمیلی, ''Jang-e-tahmīlī'') and '''Holy Defense''' (دفاع مقدس, ''Defā'-e-moqqaddas'') in Iran, '''Saddām's''' '''[[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|Qādisiyyah]]''' (قادسيّة صدّام, ''Qādisiyyat Ṣaddām'') in Iraq, and the '''(First) Persian Gulf War''', was an armed conflict between the armed forces of [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] lasting from September 1980 to August 1988, making it the longest (by some measures) conventional [[war]] of the twentieth century.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/Longest-War-Iran-Iraq-Military-Conflict/product-reviews/0415904072</ref><ref>http://www.iranian.com/main/blog/fair/longest-war-never-again</ref><ref>http://www.safehaven.com/article/7228/war-of-blackmail</ref> It was initially referred to in English as the "Persian Gulf War" prior to the "Gulf War" of 1990 with the [[invasion of Kuwait]] by Iraq.

The war began when Iraq invaded Iran, launching a simultaneous invasion by air and land into Iranian territory on 22 September 1980 following a long history of [[Territorial dispute|border disputes]], and fears of [[Shia]] insurgency among Iraq's long-suppressed Shia majority influenced by the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iraq was also aiming to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of revolutionary chaos in Iran and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and within several months were repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June, 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive.<ref name="Molavi2005p152">{{Cite document

The war finally ended with a United Nations brokered ceasefire in the form of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 598]], which was accepted by both sides. The last [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were exchanged in 2003.<ref name="Molavi2005p152" /><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEFDC113EF937A25750C0A9659C8B63 "Threats and Responses: Briefly Noted; Iran-Iraq Prisoner Deal"], by Nazila Fathi, [[New York Times]], 14 March 2003</ref>

The war came at a great cost in lives and economic damage—half a million Iraqi and Iranian soldiers as well as civilians are believed to have died in the war with many more injured—but it brought neither reparations nor change in borders. The conflict is often compared to  [[World War I]],<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''A History of Modern Iran'', Cambridge, 2008, p.171</ref> in that the tactics used closely mirrored those of that conflict, including large scale [[trench warfare]], manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, use of [[barbed wire]] across trenches, [[human wave attacks]] across [[no-man's land]], and extensive use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]] against Iranian [[troops]] and [[civilians]] as well as Iraqi [[Kurd]]s. At the time, the UN Security Council issued statements that "chemical weapons had been used in the war." However, in these UN statements Iraq was not mentioned by name, so it has been said that "the international community remained silent as Iraq used weapons of mass destruction against Iranian as well as Iraqi Kurds" and it is believed<ref name=iranica-IIW/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/169/36403.html|title=America Didn't Seem to Mind Poison Gas|first=Joost|last=Hiltermann|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=January 17, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unobserver.com/index.php?pagina=layout5.php&id=815&blz=1|title=Arming Iraq and the Path to War|first=John|last=King|publisher=U.N.

==Background==
===History of war's name===
The war was commonly referred to as the '''Gulf War''' or '''Persian Gulf War''' until the [[Gulf War|Iraq-Kuwait conflict]] ([[Operation Desert Storm]] Jan-Feb 1991), and for a while thereafter as the '''First Persian Gulf War'''. The Iraq-Kuwait conflict, while originally known as the Second Persian Gulf War, later became known simply as '''"The Gulf War."''' The United States-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq in 2003]] and the following occupation of the country from 2003-2010 has since been called the Second Persian Gulf War.

Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]] initially dubbed the conflict "The Whirlwind War".<ref>[[Robert Fisk|Fisk, Robert]]. ''[[The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East]]''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005, p. 219. ISBN 1-84115-007-X.</ref>

==Origins==
===Post-colonial era===
On 18 December 1959, the new leader of Iraq [[Abdul Karim Qassim]], declared: "We do not wish to refer to the history of Arab tribes residing in Al-Ahwaz and Mohammareh [Khorramshahr]. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s handed over Mohammareh, which was part of Iraqi territory, to Iran." The Iraqi regime's dissatisfaction with Iran's possession of the [[petroleum|oil]]-rich [[Khuzestan]] province was not limited to rhetorical statements; Iraq began supporting [[secession]]ist movements in Khuzestan, and even raised the issue of its territorial claims at the next meeting of the [[Arab League]], without success. Iraq showed reluctance in fulfilling existing agreements with Iran—especially after the death of [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the rise of the [[Ba'ath Party]], when Iraq decided to take on the role of "leader of the [[Arab world]]".

In 1969, the deputy prime minister of Iraq stated: "Iraq's dispute with Iran is in connection with Arabistan ([[Khuzestan]]) which is part of Iraq's soil and was annexed to Iran during foreign rule." Soon Iraqi [[radio station]]s began exclusively{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} broadcasting into "Arabistan", encouraging Arabs living in Iran and even [[Baloch people|Balūchīs]] to revolt against the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]'s government. [[Basra]] TV stations even began showing Iran's Khuzestan province as part of Iraq's new province called [[Nasiriyyah]], renaming all Iranian cities with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] names.

In 1971, Iraq broke diplomatic relations with Iran after claiming sovereignty rights over the islands of [[Abu Musa]], [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], following the withdrawal of the British.<ref name="Fendereski2005">{{cite web | title = 2005: Tonb (Greater and Lesser) | first = Guive |last= Fendereski

}}</ref> Iraq then [[Confiscation|expropriated]] the properties of 70,000 Iraqis of Iranian origin and expelled them from its territory, after complaining to the Arab League and the UN without success. Many, if not most of those expelled were in fact Iraqi Shia who had little to no family ties with Iran, and the vast majority of whom spoke Arabic, rather than Persian . The expulsions formed part of a longstanding Iraqi Baathist tradition of marginalizing and delegitimizing the Shia minority by alleging subversive ties with Iran.<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2783989.stm News.BBC.co.uk], "Iraq's rich mosaic of people", 2003</ref>

One of the factors contributing to hostility between the two powers was a dispute over full control of the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway (known as ''Arvand Rud'' in Iran) at the head of the Persian Gulf, an important channel for the oil exports of both countries.

In addition to Iraq's fomenting of separatism in Iran's [[Khuzestan]] and [[Iranian Balochistan]] provinces, both countries encouraged separatist activities by [[Kurd]]ish nationalists in the other country. During the first few years of the 1980–1988 Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi government tried to accommodate the Kurds in order to focus on the war against Iran. In 1984, the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] agreed to cooperate with Baghdad, but the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|Kurdish Democratic Party]] remained opposed.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22079.pdf CRS Report for Congress: The Kurds in Post-Saddam Iraq(Page 2)]</ref>

In the 1975 [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Accord]] Iraq made territorial concessions — including the waterway — in exchange for normalized relations.

The relationship between Iranian and Iraqi governments briefly improved in 1978, when Iranian agents in Iraq discovered a pro-Soviet [[coup d'état]] against the Iraqi government. When informed of this plot, [[Saddam Hussein]], who was Vice President at the time, ordered the execution of dozens of his army officers, and to return the favor, expelled [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], an exiled leader of clerical opposition to the Shah, from Iraq.

===After the Islamic Revolution===
{{See also|Islamic Revolution|Iranian Embassy Siege|Modern usage of al-Qādisiyyah}}
[[File:Saddam-Iraqi-25-dinar.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Iraq]]i 25-[[Iraqi dinar|dinar]] note, with the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]] depicted in the background]]
Iran's [[Pan-Islamism]] and revolutionary Shia [[Islamism]] and Iraq's Arab nationalism were central to the conflict. Saddam Hussein was keenly interested in elevating Iraq to a strong regional power. A successful invasion of Iran would enlarge Iraq's oil reserves and make Iraq the dominant power in the Persian Gulf region.

On several occasions Saddam [[Modern usage of al-Qādisiyyah#Qādisiyyat-Ṣaddām: The Iran-Iraq War|alluded to]] the [[Islamic conquest of Iran]] in propagating his position against Iran. For example, on 2 April 1980, half a year before the outbreak of the war, in a visit by Saddam to al-Mustansiriyyah University in Baghdad, drawing parallels with the 7th century defeat of Persia in the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]], he announced:

<BLOCKQUOTE>In your name, brothers, and on behalf of the Iraqis and Arabs everywhere we tell those [[Persian Empire|Persian]] cowards and dwarfs who try to avenge Al-Qadisiyah that the spirit of Al-Qadisiyah as well as the blood and honor of the people of Al-Qadisiyah who carried the message on their spearheads are greater than their attempts."<ref>Speech made by Saddam Hussein. Baghdad, ''Voice of the Masses'' in Arabic, 1200 GMT 2 April 1980. FBIS-MEA-80-066. 3 April 1980, E2-3. E3</ref></BLOCKQUOTE>

In turn the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] believed Muslims, particularly the [[Shi'a Islam|Shias]] in Iraq, [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Kuwait]], whom he saw as oppressed, could and should follow the Iranian example, rise up against their governments to join a united Islamic republic.<ref>{{cite book

At the same time severe officer purges (including several executions ordered by [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], the post-revolution ''[[sharia]]'' ruler), and spare parts shortages for Iran's American-made equipment, had crippled Iran's once mighty [[military of Iran|military]]. The bulk of the Iranian military was made up of poorly armed, though committed, [[militia]]s. Iran had minimal defenses in the Shatt al-Arab river.

==War==
===Iraqi pretext for war and Iraqi war aims===
Iraq's pretext was an alleged assassination attempt on [[Foreign Minister]] [[Tariq Aziz]] in southern Iraq, which Saddam Hussein blamed on "Iranian agents", in one of his speeches.

[[File:Shatt al arab.png|thumb|right|The [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway on the Iran–Iraq border]]
"Relations deteriorated rapidly until in March 1980, Iran unilaterally downgraded its diplomatic ties to the [[charge d'affaires]] level, withdrew its ambassador, and demanded that Iraq do the same. The tension increased in April following the attempted assassination of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] and, three days later, the bombing of a funeral procession being held to bury students who had died in an earlier attack. Iraq blamed Iran, and in September, attacked.<ref name="Cruze1988" />

[[File:Iranian Resistance.jpg|thumb|right|210px|An armed Iranian militia woman in front of a mosque during the Iraqi invasion of [[Khorramshahr]], September–October 1980]]
On 17 September, in a statement addressed to the Iraqi parliament, Saddam Hussein stated that "The frequent and blatant Iranian violations of Iraqi sovereignty...have rendered the [[1975 Algiers Agreement]] null and void... This river...must have its Iraqi-Arab identity restored as it was throughout history in name and in reality with all the disposal rights emanating from full sovereignty over the river.",<ref name="Karsh">{{cite book

The objectives of Iraq's invasion of Iran were:
#Control of the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway by Iraqis
#Acquisition of the three islands of [[Abu Musa]] and the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]], on behalf of the [[UAE]].
#Annexation of [[Khuzestan]] to Iraq
#Prevent the spread of the [[Islamic Revolution]] in the region

Iraq had mobilized 21 divisions for the invasion, while Iran countered with only 13 regular army divisions and one brigade. Of these divisions, only seven were deployed to the border.

The [[blitzkrieg|surprise offensive]] advanced quickly against the still disorganized [[military of Iran|Iranian forces]], advancing on a wide front into Iranian territory along the [[Mehran, Ilam Province|Mehran]]–[[Khorramabad]] axis in central Iran and towards [[Ahvaz]] in the oil-rich southern province of [[Khuzestan]].

===1981: The Iraqi invasion stalls===
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Iraqi stamp.jpg|180px|left|thumb| Iraqi stamp depicting the original Battle of [[al-Qādisiyyah]] and the Iran–Iraq War which Saddam referred to as "Saddam's al-Qādisiyyah"]] -->
The Iraqi invasion soon encountered unexpected resistance, however, and around March 1981 it stalled. A preemptive strike executed by the [[Iraqi Air Force]] on the first day of the war successfully destroyed parts of Iran's airbase infrastructure, but failed to destroy a significant number of aircraft. The [[Iraqi Air Force|IQAF]] was only able to strike in depth with a few [[MiG-23BN]], [[Tu-22]] and [[Su-20]] aircraft, ineffective in a country as large as Iran. When three MiG-23BN's flew over Tehran, they attacked its airport but damaged only a few aircraft.<ref name="Cordesman1990">{{cite book

===1982: Iraqi retreat, Iranian offensive====
[[File:Khorramshahr POWs crop.jpg|thumb|Demoralized Iraqi soldiers taken [[PoW]] at Khorramshahr]]
For about a year after the Iraqi offensive stalled in March 1981 there was little change in the front, but in mid-March 1982 Iran took the offensive and the Iraqi military was forced to retreat. By June 1982, an Iranian counter-offensive had recovered the areas lost to Iraq earlier in the war. An especially significant battle of this counter-offensive in the Khuzestan province was the [[Liberation of Khorramshahr]] from the Iraqis on 24 May 1982. A total of 7,000 Iraqis had been killed or wounded in Khorramshahr<ref>[[John Keegan]]:''The Iraq War''</ref> and 19,000 taken prisoner, while the Iranians had suffered 10,000 casualties.

Saddam decided to withdraw his armed forces completely from Iran, and that they should be deployed along the international border between Iraq and Iran.<ref name="FKR" />  [[Efraim Karsh]] states that Saddam made this choice because the Iraqi leader believed that his army was now too demoralised and damaged to hold onto any territory in Iran, and that Iran could be successfully resisted through a line of defence on Iraqi land near the border.<ref name="FKR" />

Under the slogans "War, War until Victory" and "The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala",<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', pp. 171, 175.</ref> Iran advanced. A tactic used in this advance noted throughout the world was the encouragement of heroism among young Iranian [[basij]] volunteers who sought martyrdom in human wave attacks on Iraqi positions. The volunteers were inspired before battle by tales of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], the [[Battle of Karbala]], and the supreme glory of [[Istishhad|martyrdom]], and sometimes by an actor (usually a more mature soldier), playing the part of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Hossein]] himself riding a white horse, galloping along the lines, providing the inexperienced soldiers a vision of "the hero who would lead them into their fateful battle before they met their God."<ref>Majd, Hooman, ''The Ayatollah Begs to Differ: The Paradox of Modern Iran'', by Hooman Majd, Doubleday, 2008, page 146</ref>

On 13 July, the Iranian units crossed the border in force, aiming towards the city of [[Basra]], the second most important city in Iraq. However, the enemy they encountered had entrenched itself in formidable defenses.   Unlike the hastily improvised defenses that the Iraqis had manned in Iran during the 1980–1981 occupation of the conquered territories, the border defenses were, by necessity, well developed even before the war, and the Iraqis were able to utilize a highly-developed network of bunkers and artillery fire-bases. Saddam had also more than doubled the size of the Iraqi army from 1981's 500,000 soldiers (26 divisions and 3 independent brigades) to 1985's 1,050,000 (55 divisions and nine brigades).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Saddam's efforts bore fruit. Iran had been using combined-arms operations to great effect when it was attacking the Iraqi troops in its country, and had launched the iconic human-wave attacks with great support from artillery, aircraft, and tanks. However, lack of ammunition meant that the Iranians were now launching human-wave assaults with no support from other branches of the military. The superior defenses of the Iraqis meant that tens of thousands of Iranian soldiers were lost in most operations after 1982, and the Iraqi defenses would continue to hold in most sectors.

In the Basra offensive, or [[Operation Ramadan]], five human-wave attacks were met with withering fire from the Iraqis. The boy-soldiers of Iran were particularly hard-hit, especially since they volunteered to run into minefields, in order to clear the way for the Iranian soldiers behind them. The Iranians were also hard-hit by the employment of chemical weapons and mustard gas by the Iraqis.

===1983: Strategic stalemate===

After the failure of their 1982 summer offensives, Iran believed that a major effort along the entire breadth of the front would yield the victory that they desired. Iranian numerical superiority might have achieved a break-through if they had attacked across all parts of the front at the same time, but they still lacked the organization for that type of assault. Iran was getting supplies from countries such as [[North Korea]], [[Libya]], and China. The Iraqis had more suppliers such as the [[USSR]], the [[NATO]] nations, [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]].

During the course of 1983, the Iranians launched five major assaults along the front. None met with substantial success. Khomeini's position on a truce remained unchanged.

In February 1984, Saddam ordered aerial and missile attacks against the eleven cities that he had designated. The bombardment ceased on 22 February 1984. Iran soon retaliated against urban centers, and these exchanges become known as the first "war of the cities". There would be five such exchanges throughout the course of the war.

The attacks on the Iranian cities did not destroy the Iranian government's resolve to fight. On 15 February, the Iranians launched a major attack against the central section of the front where the Second Iraqi Army Corps was deployed. 250,000 Iranians faced 250,000 Iraqis.

From 15 to 22 February, in [[Operation Dawn 5]], and 22 to 24 February, in [[Operation Dawn 6]], the Iranians attempted to capture the vital town of Kut al-Amara and to cut the key highway linking Baghdad and Basra. Capture of this road would have made it extremely difficult for the Iraqis to supply and co-ordinate the defenses, but the Iranian forces only came within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of the highway.

However, [[Operation Khaibar]] met with much greater success. Involving a number of thrusts towards the key Iraqi city of [[Basra]], the operation started on the 24 February and lasted until 19 March. The Iraqi defenses, under continuous strain since 15 February, seemed close to breaking conclusively. The Iraqis successfully stabilized the front but not before the Iranians captured part of the [[Majnun Islands]]. Despite a heavy Iraqi counterattack coupled with the use of [[mustard gas]] and [[sarin]] [[nerve gas]], the Iranians held their gains and would continue to hold them almost until the end of the war.<ref name="GlobalSecIIWar"/>

=== 1984: 'Tanker War' in Persian Gulf===

The Tanker War started when Iraq attacked Iranian tankers and the oil terminal at [[Kharg]] island in 1984. Iran struck back by attacking tankers carrying Iraqi oil from Kuwait and then any tanker of the Persian Gulf states supporting Iraq. Both nations attacked oil tankers and merchant ships, including those of neutral nations, in an effort to deprive the opponent of trade. Iraq declared that all ships going to or from Iranian ports in the northern zone of the Gulf were subject to attack.

Iraq used its air power to enforce its threats, primarily helicopters, F-1 Mirage and MiG-23 fighters armed with [[Exocet]] anti-ship missiles. After repeated Iraqi attacks on Iran's main exporting facility on [[Bushehr Province#Kharg Island (Khark Island)|Khark Island]], Iran attacked a Kuwaiti tanker near [[Bahrain]] on May 13, 1984, and a Saudi tanker in Saudi waters on May 16. Attacks on ships of noncombatant nations in the Persian Gulf sharply increased thereafter, and this phase of the Iraq-Iran war was dubbed the "Tanker War."

A US Navy ship, the USS ''Stark'' was struck on May 17, 1987, by two [[Exocet]] antiship missiles fired from an [[Iraq]]i [[F-1 Mirage]]<ref>http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20STARK%20BASIC.pdf</ref><ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=erVzmflT2MIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false Desert Storm at sea: what the Navy really did by Marvin Pokrant], P 43.</ref> plane.

====Attacks on shipping====
[[Lloyd's of London]], a British [[insurance]] [[market]], estimated that the Tanker War damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian mariners. The largest portion of the attacks were directed by Iran against Kuwaiti vessels, and on 1 November 1986, Kuwait formally petitioned foreign powers to protect its shipping. The [[Soviet Union]] agreed to charter tankers starting in 1987, and the United States offered to provide protection for tankers [[flag of convenience|flying the U.S. flag]] on 7 March 1987 ([[Operation Earnest Will]] and [[Operation Prime Chance]]).<ref name="Kelley2007" />
During the course of the war Iran attacked two Soviet Navy ships which were protecting Kuwaiti tankers.<ref>http://reference.allrefer.com/country-guide-study/iran/iran172.html</ref> One of the ships which was damaged as a result of an attack during the war was the [[Seawise Giant]] carrying Iranian crude which was struck by French [[Exocet]] missiles fired by Iraqi air force resulting in the damage of the largest ship ever built in history.<ref>http://www.relevantsearchscotland.co.uk/ships/jahre.html</ref>

===1985 - 86: Offensives and retreats===
With his armed forces now benefiting from financial support from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Persian Gulf states, and substantial arms purchases from the [[Soviet Union]], China and France (among others), [[Saddam]] went on the offensive on 28 January 1985, for the first time since early 1980. This offensive, however, did not produce any significant gains, and the Iranians responded in kind with their own offensive directed against Basra, codenamed [[Operation Badr (1985)|Operation Badr]], on 11 March 1985. The Imam Khomeini urged Iranians on saying, "It is our belief that Saddam wishes to return Islam to blasphemy and polytheism. ... if America becomes victorious ... and grants victory to Saddam, Islam will receive such a blow that it will not be able to raise its head for a long time ... The issue is one of Islam versus blasphemy, and not of Iran versus Iraq."<ref>`Further on Khomenyni 4 April Speech on War,` broadcast 4 April 1985, quoted in ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'' by Daniel Brumberg
University of Chicago Press, 2001, pages 132-34</ref>

By this time, the failure of the unsupported human wave attacks during 1984 meant that Iran was trying to develop a better working relationship between the army and the Pasdaran. The Iranian government also worked on molding the Pasdaran units into a much more conventional fighting force. The attack did succeed in capturing a part of the Baghdad-Basra highway that had proven elusive during [[Operation Dawn 5]] and [[Operation Dawn 6]]. Saddam responded to this strategic emergency by launching chemical attacks against the Iranian positions along the highway and by initiating the second 'war of the cities' with a massive air and missile campaign against twenty Iranian towns, including [[Tehran]].

===U.S. support for Iraq===
[[File:Cargo Ship under attack in Tanker war.JPG|thumb|Cargo Ship under attack]]
The Tanker War started when Iraq attacked Iranian tankers and the oil terminal at [[Kharg]] island in 1984. Iran struck back by attacking tankers carrying Iraqi oil from Kuwait and then any tanker of the Persian Gulf states supporting Iraq. The air and small boat attacks did very little damage to Persian Gulf state economies and Iran just moved its shipping port to [[Larak Island]] in the [[strait of Hormuz]].<ref name="Dugdale2002">{{cite web

In 1982 with Iranian success on the battlefield, the U.S. made its backing of Iraq more pronounced, supplying it with intelligence, economic aid, normalizing relations with the government (broken during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]), and also supplying "dual-use" equipment and vehicles. Dual use items are civilian items such as heavy trucks, armored ambulances and communications gear as well as industrial technology that can have a military application.<ref name="King2003-03">{{Cite document

====Iraqi attack on US warship====
{{Main|USS Stark Incident}}
[[File:USS Stark.jpg|thumb|right|''Stark'' listing following two hits by Exocet missiles]]
On 17 May 1987, an Iraqi [[Mirage F1]] attack aircraft launched two [[Exocet]] missiles at the [[USS Stark (FFG-31)|USS ''Stark'' (FFG 31)]], a [[Oliver Hazard Perry class|''Perry'' class]] [[frigate]]. The first struck the port side of the ship and failed to explode, though it left burning propellant in its wake; the second struck moments later in approximately the same place and penetrated through to crew quarters, where it exploded. The detonation killed 37 crewmembers and left 21 injured. The question of whether or not Iraqi leadership authorized the attack is still unanswered. Initial claims by the Iraqi government (that ''Stark'' was inside the Iran–Iraq War zone) were shown to be false, so the motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered.  Though American officials claimed he had been executed, an ex-Iraqi Air Force commander since stated that the pilot who attacked ''Stark'' was not punished, and was still alive at the time.<ref>Fisk. ''The Great War for Civilisation'', p. 221.</ref> The attack remains the only successful anti-ship missile strike on an American warship.<ref name="ROE">{{Cite journal

====US military actions toward Iran====
However, U.S. attention was focused on isolating Iran as well as maintaining [[freedom of navigation]], criticizing Iran's mining of international waters, and sponsored [[Wikisource:United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]], which passed unanimously on 20 July, under which it skirmished with Iranian forces during [[Operation Earnest Will]]. During the [[Operation Nimble Archer]] in October 1987, the U.S. attacked Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker [[MV Sea Isle City|''Sea Isle City'']].<ref name="Kelley2007">{{Cite document

On 14 April 1988, the frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']] was badly damaged by an Iranian mine,10 wounded but none dead. U.S. forces responded with [[Operation Praying Mantis]] on 18 April, the [[United States Navy]]'s largest engagement of surface warships since [[World War II]]. Two Iranian oil platforms, two Iranian ships and six Iranian gunboats were destroyed. An American helicopter also crashed.<ref name="Kelley2007" /> (see also [[Oil Platforms (Iran v.

====US shoots down civilian airliner====
{{Main|Iran Air Flight 655}}
[[File:USS Vincennes launching SM-2MR in 1987.jpg|thumb|right|A missile departs the forward launcher of ''Vincennes'' during a 1987 exercise. The crew of the ship used the forward launcher to down [[Iran Air 655]].]]

In the course of these escorts by the U.S. Navy, the cruiser [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS ''Vincennes'']] shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]] with the loss of all 290 passengers and crew on 3 July 1988. The [[Federal Government of the United States|American government]] claimed that the airliner had been mistaken for an Iranian [[F-14 Tomcat]], and that the Vincennes was operating in international waters at the time and feared that it was under attack, which later appeared to be untrue.<ref name="ROE" /><ref>See Fisk. ''The Great War for Civilisation'', pp. 260-273.</ref> The Iranians, however, maintain that the ''Vincennes'' was in fact in Iranian territorial waters, and that the Iranian passenger jet was turning away and increasing altitude after take-off. U.S. Admiral [[William J. Crowe]] also admitted on ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' that the ''Vincennes'' was inside Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles. At the time, the captain of the Vincennes claimed that the Iranian plane did not identify itself and sent no response to warning signals from the ''Vincennes''. Apart from Iran, other independent sources, for example the airport of Dubai, have confirmed that the plane did indeed identify itself to the American naval ship and also confirmed that "the civilian aircraft was ascending and therefore could not have posed a threat," agreeing with Iranian officials.<ref name=iranica-IIW>S. M. Gieling, [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v13f6/v13f6001c.html#vii ''Iran-Iraq War''], in ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'', 2006.</ref>

According to an investigation conducted by ABC News' ''Nightline'', decoys were set during the war by the US Navy inside the [[Persian Gulf]] to lure out the Iranian gunboats and destroy them, and at the time USS ''Vincennes'' shot down the Iranian airliner, it was performing such an operation.

In 1996 the U.S. expressed regret only for the loss of innocent life, and did not make a specific apology to the Iranian government.<ref name="ROE" /><ref name="AggrPolitics">{{cite book

The shooting down of a civilian Iranian passenger plane ''Iran Air Flight 655'' by the American cruiser ''USS Vincennes'', was cited by an Iranian scholar {{Who|date=April 2008}} as apparently giving [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] reason to withdraw from the conflict:<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&fuseaction=topics.item&news_id=90411.

{{quote|An Iranian scholar present at the conference said a turning point in Iran's thinking came with the shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in July 1988 by the American cruiser USS Vincennes. That incident apparently led Ayatollah Khomeini to conclude that Iran could not risk the possibility of U.S. open combat operations against Iran and he decided it was time to end the conflict.}}

==="War of the Cities"=== 
Toward the end of the war, the land conflict regressed into [[stalemate]] largely because neither side had enough self-propelled artillery or air power to support ground advances.

The relatively professional Iraqi armed forces could not make headway against the far more numerous Iranian [[infantry]]. The Iranians were outmatched in towed and self-propelled [[artillery]], which left their tanks and troops vulnerable. What followed was the Iranians substituting infantry for artillery.

Iraq's air force soon began [[strategic bombing]] against Iranian cities, chiefly [[Tehran]], in 1985. To minimize losses from the superior Iranian Air Force, Iraq rapidly switched to [[Scud]] and [[Al Hussein (missile)|Al-Hussein]] improved Scud launches. In retaliation, Iran fired [[Scud]] missiles acquired from Libya and Syria against [[Baghdad]]. In all, Iraq launched 520 Scuds and Al-Husseins against Iran and received only 177 in exchange. In October 1986, Iraqi aircraft began to attack civilian passenger trains and aircrafts on Iranian soil, including an [[Iran Air]] Boeing 737 unloading passengers at [[Shiraz International Airport]]. <ref name="r1" />

In retaliation for the Iranian [[Operation Karbala-5]], an early 1987 attempt to capture Basra, Iraq attacked 65 cities in 226 sorties over 42 days, bombing civilian neighborhoods. Eight Iranian cities came under attack from Iraqi missiles. The bombings killed 65 children in an elementary school in [[Borujerd]] alone. The Iranians also responded with Scud missile attacks on Baghdad and struck a primary school there. These events became known as "the war of the cities".<ref name="AggrPolitics" />

===Towards a ceasefire===
[[File:Mersad.jpg|thumb|250px|[[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] supported by Saddam started their ten-day operation after the Iranian government accepted UN Resolution 598. Casualties ranged from 2,000 to 10,000.]]
1987 saw a renewed wave of Iranian offensives against targets in both the north and south of Iraq. Iranian troops were stopped by Iraqi prepared defenses in the south in a month-and-a-half long battle for Basra ([[Operation Karbala-5]]), but met with more success later in the year in the north as Operations [[Operation Nasr 4|Nasr 4]] and [[Operation Karbala-10|Karbala-10]] threatened to capture the oil-rich Iraqi city of [[Kirkuk]] and other northern oilfields. However, the Iranian forces were unable to consolidate their gains and continue their advance, and so 1987 saw little land change hands. On 20 July, the Security Council of the United Nations passed the US-sponsored Resolution 598, which called for an end to fighting and a return to pre-war boundaries.<ref name="globalsecurity.org">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm</ref>

By April 1988, however, the Iraqi forces had regrouped sufficiently to begin a new series of devastating attacks on the Iranians, and in quick succession recaptured the strategic al-Faw peninsula (lost in 1986 in [[Operation Dawn-8]]) and territory around Basra and also struck deep into the Iranian north, capturing much matériel.<ref name="GlobalSecIIWar" />  In July 1988 Iraqi airplanes dropped chemical cyanide bombs on the Iranian Kurdish village of Zardan (as they had done four months earlier at their own Kurdish village of Halabja). Hundreds were killed at once, and the survivors are still suffering from a variety of physical and mental disorders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Following these major setbacks, Iran accepted the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 and on 20 August 1988 peace was restored.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] started their [[Operation Mersad|ten-day operation]] after the Iranian government accepted UN Resolution 598. While Iraqi forces attacked [[Khuzestan]], the Mujahedin attacked western Iran and battled the Pasdaran for Kermanshah. Close air support from the Iraqis contributed to whatever gains the Mojahedin made. However, under heavy international pressure for ending the war, Saddam Hussein withdrew his fighter aircraft and the sky opened for the Iranian airborne forces to be deployed behind Mojahedin lines. The operation ended in a defeat for the Mojahedin. Casualty figures range from 2,000 to as high as 10,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Comparison of Iraqi and Iranian military strength==
{{Main|Order of battle during the Iran–Iraq War}}

At the commencement of hostilities, Iraq held a clear advantage in armour, while both nations were roughly at parity with artillery. The gap only widened as the war went on. Iran started with a stronger air force, but over time, the balance of power flipped towards favoring Iraq. By the end of the war, Iraq enjoyed an immense numerical superiority over Iran's forces in every category. ''[[The Economist]]'' estimates for 1980 and 1987 were:<ref>"The Arming, and Disarming, of Iran's Revolution," ''[[The Economist]]'', International Edition, 19 September 1987, 56-57.</ref>

==Foreign support to Iraq and Iran==
{{Main|International aid to combatants in the Iran–Iraq War}}
[[File:Shakinghands high.OGG|thumb|thumbtime=05|[[Donald Rumsfeld]] as US special envoy to the Middle East, meets Saddam in December 1983 ([[:File:Shakinghands high.OGG|video]]). Rumsfeld would later become [[United States Secretary of Defense|US Defense Secretary]] during the [[2003 Iraq War]] which saw Saddam ousted from power, and ultimately [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|executed]].]]
During the war, Iraq was regarded by the [[Western world|West]] (and specifically the United States) as a counterbalance to [[Iranian Revolution|post-revolutionary]] [[Iran]]. The support of Iraq took the form of technological aid, [[intelligence]], the sale of dual-use and military equipment and satellite intelligence to Iraq. While there was direct combat between Iran and the United States, it is not universally agreed that the fighting between the U.S. and Iran was specifically to benefit Iraq, or for separate, although occurring at the same time, issues between the U.S. and Iran. American ambiguity towards which side to support was summed up by [[Henry Kissinger]] when the American statesman remarked that "it's a pity they [Iran and Iraq] both can't lose."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6662950/Like-the-Iran-Iraq-war.html |title=Like the Iran-Iraq war. &#124; Goliath Business News |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>
More than 30 countries provided support to Iraq, Iran, or both. Iraq, in particular, had a complex clandestine procurement network to obtain munitions and critical materials, which, in some transactions, involved 10-12 countries. Also, a number of Arab mercenaries and volunteers from Egypt<ref>http://books.google.ee/books?id=BABAZqVgfq0C&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> and Jordan (called the Yarmouk Brigade<ref>http://books.google.ee/books?id=jh3Q5F7BaB8C&pg=PA368#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>) participated in the war alongside Iraqis.

Among major powers, the United States' policy was to "tilt" toward Iraq by reopening diplomatic channels, lifting restrictions on the export of dual-use technology, overseeing the transfer of third party military hardware, and providing operational intelligence on the battlefield.

As will be seen in some of the country-specific sub-articles of this page, Iraq made extensive use of front companies, middlemen, secret ownership of all or part of companies all over the world, forged [[end user certificate]]s and other methods to hide what it was acquiring. At this time, the country-level sub-articles emphasize the country in which the procurement started, but also illustrate how procurement infrastructure was established in different countries. Some transactions may have involved people, shipping, and manufacturing in as many as 10 countries.<ref name="UNSCOM-D">{{Cite document

In their documentary ''[[Saddam Hussein-The Trial You Will Never See]]'', made for European audience, [[Barry Lando]] and [[Michel Despratx]] claim that United States secretary of state [[Alexander Meigs Haig Jr.]] wrote in a secret memo to President [[Ronald Reagan]], about United States previous president [[Jimmy Carter]]'s green light to [[Saddam Hussein]]{{Verify credibility|date=July 2010}} for launching a war against Iran using [[Saudi Arabia]] delivering the go ahead message to Iraqis.<ref>[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article17053.htm InformationClearinghouse.info]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeY05iS5iv0&feature=related YouTube.com]</ref> [[British support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war]] especially illustrated the ways by which Iraq would circumvent export controls. Iraq bought at least one British company with operations in the U.K. and the U.S.

Iraq had a complex relationship with France and the [[Soviet Union]], its major suppliers of actual weapons, to some extent having the two nations compete for its business.

[[Singapore support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war]] discusses land mines assembled there, as well as chemical warfare precursors shipped from Singapore, possibly by an Iraqi front company.

Another country that had an important role in arming Iraq was Italy, whose greatest impact was financial, through the U.S. branch of the state-owned largest bank in Italy. The Italian article is one example of how Iraq circumvented a national embargo, by, as one example, moving land and sea mine production to Singapore.

Additional country details will be added as the articles become available, in some cases in stub format for individual yet significant support, such as providing the largest amount of precursor chemicals from which chemical weapons were produced.

Although the [[United Nations Security Council]] called for a cease-fire after a week of fighting and renewed the call on later occasions, the initial call was made while Iraq occupied Iranian territory. Moreover, the UN refused to come to Iran's aid to repel the Iraqi invasion. The Iranians thus interpreted the UN as subtly biased in favor of Iraq.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580640_2/Iran-Iraq_War.html "Iran–Iraq War," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008] [http://encarta.msn.com encarta.msn.com] © 1997–2008 Microsoft Corporation.

===Iran===
While the United States directly fought Iran, citing [[freedom of navigation]] as a major ''[[casus belli]]'', as part of a complex and partially illegal program (see [[Iran-Contra Affair]]), it also indirectly supplied weapons to Iran.

[[North Korea]] was a [[North Korean support for Iran during the Iran–Iraq war|major arms supplier to Iran]], often acting as a third party in arms deals between Iran and the Communist bloc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. DPRK support included domestically manufactured arms and Eastern-Bloc weapons for which the major powers wanted [[deniability]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. [[Libya]] and [[Peoples Republic of China|China]] were arms suppliers and supporters of Iran as well.

===Both countries===
Besides the US and the Soviet Union, [[Yugoslavia]] also sold weapons to both countries for the entire duration of the conflict. Likewise, [[Portugal]] helped both countries: it was not unusual seeing Iranian and Iraqi flagged [[ships]] moored side-by-side at the [[port of Sines]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

From 1980 to 1987 [[Spain]] sold €458 million in weapons to Iran and €172 million in weapons to Iraq. Spain sold to Iraq 4x4 vehicles, [[BO-105]] Helicopters, explosives and ammunition. A research party discovered that an unexploded chemical Iraqi warhead in Iran was manufactured in Spain.<ref>[[El Mundo (Spain)]] book. ''El Camino de la Libertad. La democracia año a año. 1986'' ISBN 978-84-92540-09-9. Page 27-32.</ref>

Although neither side did acquire any weapons from [[Turkey]], both sides enjoyed Turkish civilian help during conflict. Having managed
to remain neutral and refused to support trade embargo imposed by [[United States of America|US]], [[Ankara]] turned out to be the one upon whom both warring sides developed high degree of economic dependancy, since Turkey was one of their few outlets to the west and source of local goods. Turkey's export jumped from $220 million in 1981 to $2 billion in 1985, making up 25% of Turkey's overall exports. Additionally, Turkish construction projects in [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] totaled $2.5 billion between 1974 and 1990. These benefits helped Turkey to offset the ongoing Turkish economic crisis, though they decreased with the end of the war and vanished thanks to [[Invasion of Kuwait|Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq]] and [[Iraq sanctions|Turkish response]] to it.<ref>[[Graham Fuller|Fuller, Graham E.]] 2008 "''The new Turkish Republic, Turkey as a pivotal state in the Muslim world''"  ISBN 978-1-60127-019-1 Page 40,98</ref>

==Financial support==
Iraq's main financial backers were the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]] states, most notably [[Saudi Arabia]] ($30.9 billion), [[Kuwait]] ($8.2 billion) and the [[United Arab Emirates]] ($8 billion).<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2004/isg-final-report/ch2_anxd_img06.jpg Iraq debt: non-Paris Club creditors]</ref>

The [[Iraqgate]] scandal revealed that an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] branch of Italy's largest bank, [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]], relying partially on U.S. taxpayer-guaranteed loans, funneled $5 billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. In August 1989, when [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents finally raided the Atlanta branch of BNL, the branch manager, Christopher Drogoul, was charged with making unauthorized, clandestine, and illegal loans to Iraq — some of which, according to his indictment, were used to purchase arms and weapons technology.

The ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Ted Koppel]], covered the Iraq-gate story, and the investigation by the U.S. Congress.<ref name="FAS">{{Cite document

Beginning in September 1989, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' laid out the first charges that BNL, relying heavily on U.S. government-guaranteed loans, was funding Iraqi chemical and nuclear weapons work. For the next two and a half years, the ''Financial Times'' provided the only continuous newspaper reportage (over 300 articles) on the subject. Among the companies shipping militarily useful technology to Iraq under the eye of the U.S. government, according to the ''Financial Times'', were [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Tektronix]], and [[Arms-to-Iraq|Matrix Churchill]], through its [[Ohio]] branch.<!--dead link<ref>Report by [[Columbia Journalism Review]]: http://www.cjr.org/archives.asp?url=/93/2/iraqgate.asp</ref>--> {{Clarify|date=January 2008}}

==Use of chemical weapons by Iraq==
{{See also|Halabja poison gas attack}}
[[File:Chemical weapons Halabja Iraq March 1988.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Chemical weapons]], used by [[Iraq]], killed and injured numerous Iranians and Kurds]]
With more than 100,000 Iranian victims of Iraq's chemical weapons during the eight-year war, [[Iran]] is one of the countries most severely afflicted by [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref name="r1">Center for Documents of The Imposed War, Tehran. (مرکز مطالعات و تحقیقات جنگ)</ref><ref>Iran's weapons of mass destruction: the real and potential threat‎ by Anthony H. Cordesman - p. 27</ref> In a declassified report, the CIA estimated in 1991 that Iran had suffered more than 50,000 casualties from Iraq's use of several chemical weapons,<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.438</ref> but today the actual number of victims is estimated to more than 100,000, since the long term effects still causes casualties to this day.<ref>History's Greatest War‎ by Terry Bryant, 2007</ref><ref>The Iran-Iraq War: The Politics of Aggression by Farhang Rajaee, University Press of Florida</ref>

The official estimate does not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans of Iran. According to a 2002 article in the ''[[Star-Ledger]]'':
<blockquote>
"Nerve gas killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 90,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions."<ref>{{Cite journal

</blockquote>
Iraq also used chemical weapons on Iranian civilians, killing many in villages and hospitals. Many civilians suffered severe burns and health problems, and still suffer from them.<ref name="r1" />

On 21 March 1986, the United Nations Security Council made a declaration stating that "members are profoundly concerned by the unanimous conclusion of the specialists that chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by Iraqi forces against Iranian troops and the members of the Council strongly condemn this continued use of chemical weapons in clear violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which prohibits the use in war of chemical weapons."  The United States was the only member who voted against the issuance of this statement.<ref>[51] S/17911 and Add. 1, 21 March 1986. Note that this is a "decision" and not a resolution.</ref> A mission to the region in 1988 found evidence of the use of chemical weapons, and was condemned in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 612|Security Council Resolution 612]].

According to retired Colonel Walter Lang, senior defense intelligence officer for the United States [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] at the time, "the use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter of deep strategic concern" to Reagan and his aides, because they "were desperate to make sure that Iraq did not lose."  He claimed that the Defense Intelligence Agency "would have never accepted the use of chemical weapons against civilians, but the use against military objectives was seen as inevitable in the Iraqi struggle for survival",<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/world/officers-say-us-aided-iraq-in-war-despite-use-of-gas.html Officers Say U.S. Aided Iraq in War Despite Use of Gas], [[New York Times]], 18 August 2002.</ref> The Reagan administration did not stop aiding Iraq after receiving reports of the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians.<ref name="Galbraith">{{Cite journal

[[File:Halabja1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aftermath of Halabja poison gas attack by the [[Iraqi Air Force]]]]
The U.S. also accused Iran of using chemical weapons.<ref>Fisk. ''The Great War for Civilisation'', p. 214.</ref> These allegations however, have been disputed. [[Joost Hiltermann]], who was the principal researcher for [[Human Rights Watch]] between 1992–1994, conducted a two year study, including a field investigation in Iraq, capturing Iraqi government documents in the process. According to Hiltermann, the literature on the Iran–Iraq War reflects a number of allegations of chemical weapons use by Iran, but these are "marred by a lack of specificity as to time and place, and the failure to provide any sort of evidence".<ref name="Potter153">{{Cite book

==Distinctions and Peculiarity==

Iran [[Iranian Air Force in Iran-Iraq war|attacked]] and partially damaged the [[Osirak]] [[nuclear reactor]] on September 30, 1980 with two [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]], shortly after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War. This was the first attack on a [[nuclear reactor]] and only the third on a nuclear facility in history of the world. It was also the first instance of a [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive]] attack on a nuclear reactor to forestall the development of a [[nuclear weapon]], though it did not achieve its objective as [[France]] repaired the reactor after the Iranian attack.<ref>http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52412</ref> It took a second pre-emptive strike by the [[Israeli Air Force]] to disable the reactor, in the process killing a French engineer and causing [[France]] to pull out of [[Osirak]]. The decommissioning of [[Osirak]] has been cited as causing a substantial delay to Iraqi acquisition of [[nuclear weapon]]s, which [[Saddam]] announced an intention to develop in response to the Iranian revolution.<ref>[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/mcnair41/41irq.htm AF.mil]</ref><ref name="au.af.mil">[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/mcnair41/41not.htm#39 AF.mil]</ref><ref>[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/mcnair41/41irq.htm McNair Paper 41, Radical Responses to Radical Regimes: Evaluating Preemptive Counter-Proliferation, May 1995<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/facility/osiraq.htm FAS.org]</ref><ref name="google.com">[http://google.com/search?q=cache:ZlBdwCEy9yAJ:www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/Osirak.pdf+osirak+repair+after+iranian+attack&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=firefox-a Google.com]</ref><ref name="google.com"/><ref>[http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache%3AOYG-qrRsMxkJ%3Abelfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu%2Ffiles%2Fis3104_pp007-033_raas_long.pdf+osirak+iran&hl=en&gl=ca Docs.Google.com]</ref><ref>[http://airtoair.blogfa.com/post-18.aspx Blogfa.com]</ref>

The Iran-Iraq War was also the first and only conflict in the history of warfare in which both forces used [[Ballistic Missiles]] against each other.<ref name="au.af.mil"/>

This war also saw the only confirmed air-to-air helicopter battles in history of warfare with the Iraqi [[Mi-25]]s flying against Iranian [[AH-1 SuperCobra]] on numerous occasions. The first instance of these helicopter "[[dogfight]]s" happened when on the starting day of the war (22 September 1980), two Iranian SuperCobras crept up on two Mi-25s and hit them with [[TOW]] wire-guided antitank missiles. One Mi-25 went down immediately, the other was badly damaged and crashed before reaching base. The Iranians pulled off a repeat performance on 24 April 1981, destroying two Mi-25s without incurring losses to themselves. According to some unclassified documents, Iranian pilots achieved a 10 to 1 kill ratio over the Iraqi helicopter pilots during these engagements and even engaged Iraqi fixed wing aircraft.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_214.shtml ACIG.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/avhind_2.html Vectorsite.net]</ref>

As is the case with some wars that help improve and refine surgical treatments<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1238278-overview</ref>, this war had an impact on medical sciences. A new surgical intervention for [[Coma|comatosed]] patients with penetrating [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] which was [[Science and technology in Iran#Medical sciences|created by Iranian physicians]] treating Iranian wounded soldiers during the war later on helped make new [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical treatment]] guidelines for use of civilians who have suffered blunt or penetrating skull injuries, thereby greatly improving survival rates. The previously used surgical technique and its resultant guidelines developed by [[US army]] during [[World War II]] and [[Vietnam War]] has been replaced by this new treatment module and it has been reported that US congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]] benefited from the new guidelines after [[2011 Tucson shooting|she was shot in head]].<ref>http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-medical-advances-20110124,0,3062896.story</ref><ref>http://www.quedit.com/detail/advances-in-treatment-help-more-people-survive-severe-injuries-to-the-brain-5128922.html</ref><ref>http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/la-he-medical-advances-20110124,0,1844181.story</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Mosque damage.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Damage to a mosque in [[Khoramshahr]].]]
[[File:Yazd3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Iranian Martyr Cemetery in [[Yazd]].]]

The Iran–Iraq War was extremely costly in lives and material, one of the deadliest wars since [[World War II]]. Both countries were devastated by the effect of the war. It cost Iran an estimated 1 million casualties, killed or wounded, and Iranians continue to suffer and die as a consequence of Iraq's use of chemical weapons. Iraqi casualties are estimated at 250,000-500,000 killed or wounded. Thousands of civilians died on both sides in air raids and ballistic missile attacks.<ref name="AggrPolitics"/>

The financial loss was also enormous, at the time exceeding US$600 billion for each country ($1.2 trillion in total). But shortly after the war it turned out that the economic cost of war is more profound and long-lasting than the estimates right after the war suggested.<ref name="encyclopedia1">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580640_2/Iran-Iraq_War.html |title=Iran-Iraq War - MSN Encarta |publisher=Encarta.msn.com |date=1988-08-20 |accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> Economic development was stalled and oil exports disrupted. These economic woes were of a more serious nature for [[Iraq]] that had to incur huge debts during the war as compared to the very small debt of Iran, as Iranians had used bloodier but economically cheaper tactics during the war, in effect substituting soldiers lives for lack of financial funding during their defense. This put Saddam in a difficult position, particularly with his war-time allies, as by then Iraq was under more than $130 billion of international debt, excluding the interest in an after war economy with a slowed [[GDP growth]]. A large portion of this debt was loaned by [[Paris Club]] amounting to $21 billion, 85% of which had originated from seven countries of [[Japan]], [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[United States]], [[Italy]] and [[United Kingdom]]. But the largest portion of $130 billion debt was to Iraq's former Arab backers of the war including the $67 billion loaned by [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[UAE]] and [[Jordan]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

After the war, Kuwait started to over-produce oil in order to keep Iraq's economy down. Iraq also accused Kuwait of slant drilling and stealing oil which lead to the invasion of [[Kuwait]], which in turn  worsened Iraq's financial situation as the [[United Nations Compensation Commission]] awarded reparations amounting more than $200 billion to victims of the invasion including Kuwait, [[United States]], individuals and companies among others, to be paid by Iraq in oil commodity. To enforce payment of these reparations Iraq was put under a [[Iraq sanctions|complete international embargo]]. This put further strain on the Iraqi economy, pushing its [[external debt]] and international liabilities to private and public sectors including interest to more than $500 billion by the end of [[Saddam]]'s rule. Combined with negative economic growth of Iraq after the prolonged international sanctions, this produced a [[Debt-to-GDP ratio]] of more than 1,000%, making Iraq the most indebted poor country in the world. This unsustainable economic situation compelled the new Iraqi government formed after the fall of Saddam to request the writing off of a considerable portion of loans incurred during the Iran&ndash;Iraq war.<ref name="docs.google.com">[http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:5u7kx8xIbOQJ:fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33376.pdf+iraq+debt+including+interest&hl=en&gl=ca Docs.Google.com]</ref><ref name="iie.com">[http://www.iie.com/publications/opeds/oped.cfm?ResearchID=249 IIE.com]</ref><ref name="mees.com">[http://www.mees.com/postedarticles/finance/iraq/a46n10b01.htm Mees.com]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7492115.stm News.BBC.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5736M320090804?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0 Reuters.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.jubileeiraq.org/reperations.htm JubileeIraq.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.probeinternational.org/odious-debts/western-countries-cancel-iraqi-debt-gulf-countries-dont ProbeInternational.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Area=ia&ID=IA43808&Page=archives Memri.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.investorsiraq.com/showthread.php?p=679658 InvestorsIraq.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.jubileeiraq.org/translations/farsi.htm JubileeIraq.org]</ref>

The war and its outcome, also had a marked effect on the scientific and technological advancement of the countries involved. In case of Iraq, after the war, its scientific and technological productivity collapsed and has not yet recovered.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Kuwait's scientific output on the other hand was slowed initially due to the funding it extended to Saddam and later on became stagnant.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Iran on the other hand experienced a scientific revival due to the war and has the [[Science and technology in Iran#International Rankings|fastest scientific growth rate]] in the world today.<ref>http://www.science-metrix.com/30years-Paper.pdf</ref>

Much of the oil industry in both countries was damaged in [[airstrike|air raids]]. Iran's production capacity has yet to fully recover from the damages of the war. 10 million shells had landed in Iraq's oil fields at Basra, seriously damaging Iraq's oil production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Prisoners taken by both sides were not released until more than 10 years after the end of the conflict.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Cities on both sides had also been considerably damaged.
Not all saw the war in negative terms. The Islamic Revolution of Iran was strengthened and radicalized.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pages 140</ref> The Iranian government-owned ''Etelaat'' newspaper wrote:
<blockquote>"There is not a single school or town that is excluded from the happiness of "holy defence" of the nation, from drinking the exquisite elixir of martyrdom, or from the sweet death of the martyr, who dies in order to live forever in paradise."<ref>Column in ''Etelaat'', 4 April 1983, quoted in Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'' (Norton), (2006)</ref> </blockquote>

The Iraqi government commemorated the war with various monuments, including the [[Hands of Victory]] and the [[Al-Shaheed Monument]], both in Baghdad.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The war left the [[border]]s unchanged.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Two years later, as war with the western powers loomed, Saddam recognized Iranian rights over the eastern half of the Shatt al-Arab, a reversion to the ''status quo ante bellum'' that he had repudiated a decade earlier.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Declassified US intelligence available has explored both the domestic and foreign implications of Iran's apparent (in 1982) victory over Iraq in their then two-year old war.<ref>SNIE 34/36.2-82 link: [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB167 Intelligence Reports on Saddam Hussein's Reign]</ref>

On 9 December 1991, the UN Secretary-General reported the following to the UN Security Council:
<blockquote>
"That Iraq's explanations do not appear sufficient or acceptable to the international community is a fact. Accordingly, the outstanding event under the violations referred to is the attack of 22 September 1980, against Iran, which cannot be justified under the charter of the United Nations, any recognized rules and principles of international law or any principles of international morality and entails the responsibility for conflict."

"Even if before the outbreak of the conflict there had been some encroachment by Iran on Iraqi territory, such encroachment did not justify Iraq's aggression against Iran—which was followed by Iraq's continuous occupation of Iranian territory during the conflict—in violation of the prohibition of the use of force, which is regarded as one of the rules of jus cogens."

"On one occasion I had to note with deep regret the experts' conclusion that "chemical weapons had been used against Iranian civilians in an area adjacent to an urban center lacking any protection against that kind of attack" (s/20134, annex). The Council expressed its dismay on the matter and its condemnation in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 620|Resolution 620]] (1988), adopted on 26 August 1988."<ref>See items 6, 7, and 8 of the UN Secretary General's report to the [[UN Security Council]] on 9 December 1991: [http://www.iranian.com/Kasraie/2005/April/Ahwaz/Images/page1.pdf Iranian.com]</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2005, the new government of Iraq apologized to Iran for starting the war.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/23/iran-iraq-war-anniversary</ref>
