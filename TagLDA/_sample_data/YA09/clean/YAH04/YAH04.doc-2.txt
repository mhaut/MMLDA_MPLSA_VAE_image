Personally, I try to do business thru paypal and no problems the last 9 years or so.

But if you have to give a company your credit card number, make a note of it and check your account for the next couple of days for any unauthorized purchases. I like to use Master Card for example as I can always reverse charges and if someone were to steal the number, I do not have to pay nothing, but ony thru my credit union. All banks are different on this. 

Do not be stupid and fall for the online scams. They may ask for money to may YOUR big winnings. Or they may ask for your bank account number and home address so they can deposit the money. What it says in the fine print, is that they will deposit YOUR money in THEIR bank account. Besides, tell them to mail you your check. You can wait.

And there is never an excuse for giving out your social security number too. Giving that out along with your home address to anyone is a recipe for disaster.

Did you know you can google credit report and get a FREE once a year credit report to check on your credit rating. So be like me and find out with a big surprise someone was using your name. Three years later, still trying to clear it up. I am too cheap to get a lawyer. Besides, I do not need it but those credit card companies really do not want to work with you I find out so check your credit rating. Who knows. You might need to buy a house or something and then find out too late.
