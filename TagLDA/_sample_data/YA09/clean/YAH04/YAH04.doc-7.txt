First, I don't let my computer remember my logins for me and I never let any website remember my credit card information for me. Too many eCommerce websites have been hacked and customer credit card information has been stolen for my comfort.

Second, I never follow any links that is provided to me, when I receive an email from one of my online financial institutions claming there is some kind of a problem with my account. I don't care what the story is that they are giving me. I don't care what the story they are giving me, I always open my web browser and go to the main website, which I know is their's and login and check out the problem on my own if I'm concerned. Note: if you know how to read email headers, you can usually look at them and determine whether the email really came apparent source or not, but it's not for novices and sometimes it's just easier to use the method I described.

I can't tell you how many emails I have forwarded onto eBay and PayPal Security Spoof, because I get them on a weekly basis. I don't even check my accounts out, because I know they are spoofs, so I just forward them right to them at spoof@ebay.com or spoof@paypal.com .

Third, you need to make sure you use good strong passwords on your accounts. Using something like "bird" is not good. Using "Bird39" is a little better, but it's really not strong enough, because it's too easy to crack. I use very cryptic passwords and I don't use the same one on any other website. A good example of a strong password is "8j3FnE1g".

Last but not least, watch out for any lotteries or other stories people might be giving you through email, where there is an oppertunity for you to get a lot of easy money. As safe as it might sound, you won't end up with anything. As a matter of a fact, it will be the reverse...they will end up with your money and you will be in the poor house and owing the bank!
