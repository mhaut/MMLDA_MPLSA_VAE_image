i'll try to help you out here...

let's start with the bad: 

sweetners such as equal contain aspartame, which is believed to increase the risk of brain cancer. 

sweet-n-low and similar sweeteners contain an ingredient called saccharin, which has been linked to bladder cancer.

in both of these cases, there isn't overwhelming accurate evidence, but it's been enough to cause some concern. 

splenda is another popular one, but because the body doesn't recognize, it won't digest it, and can actually make you GAIN weight.

fructose is another extract of sugar. because it's natural, it's better for you than equal or sweet n low, but because the liver can't process it as quickly as pure sugar, it converts into triglycerides, increasing your risk of heart disease.

obviously, small amounts of any of these isn't going to seriously hurt you, but a using any for a long period of time can build up and increase your risks.

fortunately, there ARE some better solutions...

my #1 reccomendation would be stevia. it's a natural herb and is actually sold as a dietary supplement.
#2 would be Xylitol. it's a natural sweetener that's actually produced in our bodies... the downside is that it's not calorie-free, although it does have a much lower calorie content. 

hope that shed a little light on your questions...
