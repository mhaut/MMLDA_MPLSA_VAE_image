Health care has its share of special interests. Doctors feel underpaid and claim they need money to pay off their med school debt. Insurance companies feel they need to increase premiums to match the price increases in health care. Employers feel health care insurance expense is rising too fast. Lawyers feel they ensure patients get fair and adequate health care. Drug companies want to maximize profits so they can reinvest into new drugs, buy startup companies and reward stockholders. Oh yea... Patients want the best health care they can get in the richest country in the world.

Let me just tackle the first problem: Doctors. My brother is a doctor and he has a huge medical school loan. Contrary is what many people think, most doctors are as not richly compensated as other professions out there, like investment bankers and private defense lawyers. They spend 4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of medical school, and 3+ years as a underpaid resident while accumulating $500k in debt plus interest. Of course they want to get paid so they can pay off debt and enjoy the fruits of their education.

Shouldn't the government find a way to provide better financing for these medical school students? It could be an education grant or a zero to very low interest student loan to pay off these loans. Maybe the government can offer to payoff an additional $100k off the loan if the student works in a third-world country or a blighted neighborhood in the U.S. for one year. That would help America's image around the world.

Also why is there so few medical schools in the U.S.? There are many qualified college graduates who can't get into medical school. If there is a greater supply of doctors, wouldn't that help health care in general?
