In a decomcracy any thing will be successful only if people are involved. Indian society accepts corruption as legitimate. No one will refuse to give his/her daughter on marriage to a guy who is corrupt (May be they will refuse if he does not take money, if he is in a position where in he can). No one shuns a person if he is corrupt, but if some one drinks a bottle of beer he will be, especially in some states like Tamilnadu. Making money by corrupt practices is accepted as part of a job and the person’s smartness. No religious leader or swamiji refuses money donated by a corrupt person – saying it is “polluted”. After serving in a Government Department for quite some time I can say not being corrupt is the most difficult part of official work- your subordinates fear you – your colleagues doubt you – your relatives make fun of you - your family nags you - ( Some one in my family quoted Thiruvalluvar – out of context though - to justify to be corrupt). A friend of mine who had tremendous opportunity to make crores of illegal money never touched even a paise but after retirement, when substantial money was needed for the treatment of his wife- which could not be met from the meager pension - every one including his children daunted him saying “ he did not use the opportunity and troubles us now”. Such persons are dubbed as “ one who does not know how to live”. One officer was caught for keeping substantial unaccounted money in his house. Next day in the office, no one ridiculed him for that but said “ why should he keep that much cash in the house” Eradicating corruption in a such situation is not easy. It needs substantial change in the mindset of the society- which cannot happen over night especially in Indian society which is tradition bound. May be the younger generation of India can do a lot for this.
