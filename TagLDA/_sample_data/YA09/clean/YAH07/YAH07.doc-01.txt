Corruption is a part of human mind.It exists all over the world.Degree and relevance varies from person to person,place to place.
In India poor have no money to pay but are forced to give their blood and bodies and are deprived of basic rights.

The poor in our country also become corrupt on the election day and ARE PAID to vote for the Netas.All political parties are responsible for allowing their Netas to do this in fear for losing.

We can curb extent of corruption by starting with each one of us not paying to expedite our own case.
The Political support to corruption is a large enemy to be faced;many times with unpleasant results for the common man.
