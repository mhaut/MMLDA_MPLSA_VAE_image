Simple to list, impossible to do.
1. Throw out all politicians
2. Scrap Democracy - god knows we dont deserve it.
3. High levels of qualifications required to join politics
4. Scrutinize incomes of all people involved in politics. Rather pay people to check corruption than to collect taxes.
5. Revamp the Justice system - Quick justice for all.
6. Police should not be under the thumb of any politician. Rather have a CEO for a term of 3 years. If crime rates increase, the CEO gets sacked.
7. Immediate death penalty to anyone guilty of increasing racial violence
8. No racial discrimation for education (esp Higher education) - Meritocracy only.
9. Spend the billions of dollars otherwise going into the pockets of the politicians to provide housing OUTSIDE already cramped cities.
10. Spend on infrastructure - roads, public transport, trains, tubes, skytrains making it possible for the poor to travel easily and get not live in chawls in the city
