First of all like this advertisement all people should be aware of this question of corruption, because every body is corrupted and aslo some new people also getting involve in corruption.
this corruption can be curbed by votting a right person in election who had done lots of good things which are helpful for the people not in this way by making roads, improving railways & buses, but also coming infront of people and think about their sadness feelings, that what they realy want and need, according to that he has to fulfill their needs & wants.

Just sitting in chair in parliament and taking oath that i will do this and i will do that, it not makes a sense, he has to come further and share the time in between peoples then only he will make nice governement and good people, and will come to know the public need's , so the person who is sitting in election should be Strong & and has to take immediate decision in right time and in right manner, and decision should be on the spot. then only the corruption can curbed


by giving this answer i think about my india that it has to be top most country in the world.
