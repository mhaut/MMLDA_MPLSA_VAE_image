Lets move our army persons from the border and bring them to delhi and mumbai and shoot all the exisiting politicians to make our country free of corruption and famine. Gandhiji's ahimsa is no more solution for india. You cannot expect any results until they are there. How many cases are pending against the politicians in supreme court? you please think about it, they will keep on prolonging it until their natural death or until the current government runs. We had enough of this. If u want India to gow as super power we need to get rid of these politicians. We are still trying to boost our economy whereas all smaller nations are far ahead of us.Its time we do somethink about it now.All our money are bottled as black money with these dirty politicians as they enjoy crores of swindled money from every source. When we go for any work they expect bribe and what they say "cost of living is very high".
Earlier we struggled and got our freedom from the british reign, now we are still struggling with our politicians to live freely. Why can't we put our thinking caps and push them out.
Honestly speaking who are these so called "terrorists", they are the ones who had felt that they need to do something for their country or province, thats wht we have so many ulfa or jihad movements. We can request them to target the politicians and free our country from crores of debt from the world bank. Its time we stop dreaming and do the reality of young India by pushing the politicians from india.
