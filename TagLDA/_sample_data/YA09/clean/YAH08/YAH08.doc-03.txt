India already has the Second highest number of guns after USA with the civilian population. The figures are like 4 for every 100 people compared to 90 for every 100 in USA. This number also is of registered weapons only! Who knows how many illegal guns "Kattas" are there states like UP and Bihar!
The problem is with irresponsible people leaving weapons lying around and stressed out people.
The civilian population should be armed because the govt. sometimes tries to take people for a ride! India's civilians should buy more arms and ask for right to bear arms so India never becomes a slave to any country ever again! Instead proper education should be given about safety!
Did you know Japan dropped the idea of invading USA mainland in world war 2 because the civilian population was armed to the teeth! Guns don't kill people, people kill people!
I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it!
India is surrounded by vultures waiting to capture it!
By the way this case was a cold premeditated murder. The two guys planned it days ahead took the weapon to school, took the victim to a secluded area and took turns shooting him! If they were adults i'd say hang them!
