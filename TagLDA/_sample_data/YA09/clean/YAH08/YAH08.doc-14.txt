With the advent of western culture including the gun culture to the shores of India in the last decade, Indian culture has no wonder slowly lost its sheen. Today people mock and doubt at the authencity of our own culture. Unable to seek quick satisfying answers people have started to abandon the same. Amongst others, ladies do not want to wear sarees, do not beleive in putting up a "bindi" or placing flowers on tresses any more, celebrate Indian festivals, wants to look and act like a man in the name of emancipation, etc. Men too have become too corrupt in their mind with easy access to pornography, sex & sensex, getting aggressive than ever, egoist etc. How can this generation ever cater moral values to the next generation. The only way to stop this invasion is to revert back to the roots with earnesty. This is going to be very difficult with people having tasted the lust of materialism (cars, television, quick modes of communication, cine movies, excessive media report, too much of travel, dresses, shopping malls, globalization etc.)
