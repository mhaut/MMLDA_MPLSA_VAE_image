To Traveler (and all others who think like him/her): For a nation like India, with a population of 1.3 billion or so people to sustain a quality of life parallel to the likes of the United States is almost as laughable as requesting the United States to stand down from it's title as "world super power." It's virtually impossible to do. How is India supposed to raise the quality of life if the United States already consumes a great majority of the resources? For India to raise the quality of life would be to compete strongly against the United States for resources; resources that the United States strongly opposes sharing to a "third world country."

As for the steps India needs to take to become a superpower, I believe India is doing a good job in bettering it's economy and military presence within the region. India is not as dependent on FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) as China is, allowing India for greater economic growth. India's tight relations with Russia allows for India's military presence in the region to better (technological improvement). India also already produces 50% more food than it needs in its own borders than it needs. The only problem that could hinder India's growth would be inflation. Americans and Europeans investing in the Indian stock market has been pushing much more American currency into India than the economy of India would like, pushing the dollar value closer to the rupee. Though this would seem like a good thing to people like "traveler" since they "help those who are poorer," India loses an economic advantage over China in that it would raise the cost of production for all companies//factories located in India. Price of each unit would increase as well with this increase in production.
