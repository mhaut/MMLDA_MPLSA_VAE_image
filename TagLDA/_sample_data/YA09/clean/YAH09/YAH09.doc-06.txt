REDUCE POPULATION.
2. To do that... educate EVERYONE, old, young, man woman, child... everyone... not only about benefits of a small family but also about the larger benefits of both a small family and formal education.

Citizens of India have to take the initiative in this regard. The problem now is not that there are no schools or there are no facilities... a bigger problem is that people do not understand the benefits of formal education because formal education is directly related to ready made, well-paid employment which is usually not the case. So, when a graduate ends up being unemployed the message goes out .... "don't waste time and money on formal education. go out and learn something that will get you a descent earning." This thinking has taken on the form of a never-ending circle. This thinking has to be changed. We have to stop thinking that just because we are graduates we should not take up jobs that give 4 or 5-figure salary only.

For example, an educated farmer will be far more successful than one who does not have any formal education. An educated housekeeper would be far more in demand than one who is not educated.
