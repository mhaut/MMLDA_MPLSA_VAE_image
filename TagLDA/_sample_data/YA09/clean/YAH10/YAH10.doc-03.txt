Many ask about SS Swastika, why it was adopted, and what it symbolizes for National Socialism. The following is a brief commentary on the subject which we hope will clear up any confusion and explain the significance of the Swastika: Most people assume that it was Adolf Hitler who selected the Swastika for the National Socialist emblem. Adolf Hitler indeed designed the National Socialist flag and much of the insignia, but the Swastika was already earmarked for the party standard before he became a member of the German Worker's Party (DAP).
The Swastika was the official symbol of the Thule Society. The Swastika was prominently displayed on the organization's letterheads and literature, and Swastika banners adorned its meetings. The NSDAP merely inherited the Swastika from its mentor, which, apparently, it ultimately absorbed as Thule Society members all became NSDAP members.

The only official reference to the meaning of the National Socialist Swastika which we have encountered is in Chapter 7 of the 2nd volume of Mein Kampf: "As National Socialists we see our program in our flag. In the red, we see the social idea of the movement, in the white, the nationalistic idea, in the Swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of Aryan man, and at the same time, also the victory of the idea of creative work, which in itself is, and will always be, anti-Semitic." This, of course, is probably only one aspect of a deeper meaning which was given to the Swastika, but we have never encountered reference to any such deeper meaning given by the Thule Society or the NSDAP. However, an investigation of some of the historical and esoteric uses of The Swastika certainly gives us some insight into its significance.
Most of us are aware that the Swastika is a sacred symbol in many lands and in many traditions. However, since the Thule Society was a Folkish Move.
