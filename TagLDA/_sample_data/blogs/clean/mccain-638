So, Sen. John McCain has aired an ad in which a narrator implores viewers of his Democratic opponent Sen. Barack Obama, "He's the biggest celebrity in the world. But is he ready to lead?" On the screen, images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton flash on the screen. In response, Paris Hilton has released a statement through her rep in order to make it clear that she did not endorse McCain's ad. "Miss Hilton was neither asked, nor did she give permission, for the use of her likeness in the ad, and has no further comment," is the official word. Oh, she's probably just pissed that McCain implied that Obama's a bigger celebrity than she is. Sen. John McCain might as well just go ahead and give up his presidential campaign because without the precious skank vote rallying behind him, his is a lost cause. Oh wait, it seems I spoke too soon...
