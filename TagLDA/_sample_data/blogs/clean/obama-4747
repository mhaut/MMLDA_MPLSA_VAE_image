Just to add a bit to Zhigang's comment; in the original post a value of porosity is assumed to be given. Porosity does not necessarily imply permeability. I assume that permeability is meant. Also assuming that the sphere is large enough that homogenity can be assumed and that the flow has a low Re number, one can use Darcy's law u_i = K_{ij}/mu dp/dx_j where u is the velocity, K is the permeability tensor, mu is the viscosity of the fluid, p is the pressure, x is the spatial direction. A rough and ready 1-D version is Q/A = K/mu delta p/L where Q is the flow rate through an area A and delta p is the pressure drop over a length L. For high Re number flows use the Forchheimer equation Q/A + alpha (Q/A)^m = K/mu delta p/L or the Ergun equation. The pressure drop can be approximated assuming that the sphere is impermeable (look for the fluid dynamics of a raindrop for an example). On the other hand, if the holes are large then the problem can be treated as a laminar flow through pipe with the input velocity distribution determined by the location of the hole relative to the circumference of the sphere. -- Biswajit
