I am trying to install drupal under windows server 2003/apache2.2/PostgreSQL 8.3/PHP 5 followed the instruction pages in drupal.org, never had any problems with drupal installation before under IIS 6/MySQL. After I filled all the database information, it takes a long time to response and eventually returns me a blank page. I checked the server error, but I couldn't figure it out what is wrong with it, the error message is: [Fri Aug 01 09:49:48 2008] [notice] Parent: Created child process 3936 [Fri Aug 01 09:49:48 2008] [notice] Child 3936: Child process is running [Fri Aug 01 09:49:48 2008] [notice] Child 3936: Acquired the start mutex.

It seems stopped at install.php page, access log is: 10.2.24.52 - - [01/Aug/2008:11:12:52 +1200] "POST /drupal/install.php?profile=default&locale=en HTTP/1.0" 200 - I have read some post here about memory limit with apache/php settings, and configured some of the setting based on the recommandtions. No luck at all!
