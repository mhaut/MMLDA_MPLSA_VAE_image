The Demorats -- you have to admire their cohesion. They have managed, due to their power, to put off a coastal drill vote -- absent Bush's rescission of a prior Executive Order in 1990 by his father, prohibiting such -- and now will be taking their recess, again putting off said vote. Two reasons, and you place their priority: Because to Speaker Pelosi, this literally is the line in the sand; In order to shield Obama, as a Senator and, moreover, The Anointed PrezzyCandy, from being seen to cast an obvious NO vote on drilling. Think about it. Why can't the GOP be as cohesive? Moreover, why could they have not been so when the power was theirs to wield? BZ
