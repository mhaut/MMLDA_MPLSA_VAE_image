I was super bored last night, so I started flipping through the endless channels on the TV.  What I found knocked me back to the 80s.  It was Little Darlings, starring Tatum ONeal and Kristy McNichol.  I was only eight when it came out at the drive in theatre.  I had the hots for Kristy McNichol back in those days.  The blue walls of my room were covered in pictures of her.  She was a hot babe, and she had and probably still has more spunk than most men could or can handle.  I was instantly transformed to the Friday night drive in, when Id sit atop a pillow and be in total awe of the spirited young woman on the enormous outdoor screen.  Those were the good ol days. So, whos picture did you have plastered all over your bedroom?  Or, do I want to ask?   P.S.:  Watch the first minute or so of the video.  Its hilarious.  I feel really bad for the guy though!  Ive never been kicked like the guy in the film, but Ive been kneed more times than I can count!   Women around here think its funny!?
