One Dae - BK All Day (produced by Marco Polo) A bunch of new music made its way to my inbox this past week, but I didn't get the chance to cover as much of it as I would have liked. So I'm going to briefly touch on a few of the songs that I thought were the best of the week, starting with the above video from Brooklyn emcee One Dae, who you might remember from his appearance on a track with Sean Price last summer (which we featured here). I'm not 100% sold on his abilities on the mic - he hasn't really hit me with any lines that have caused me to stop and take notice of him thus far, though he's certainly not a bad emcee - but he's certainly been blessed with some great production, particularly on this track, produced by Marco Polo. Nico B - G Manifesto Not to be confused with the Beast from Philly, Chicago's Nico B has been sending me several dope songs recently. His latest, G Manifesto, is loosely inspired by the life and times of mobster Henry Hill, who was famously portrayed by Ray Liotta in the movie Goodfellas. ASN featuring AZ - Road To Success I'm not really feeling this song, from Boston's A.S.N., but I thought it was interesting to hear AZ go in doubletime on the beat. Of all the appearances AZ has made on wax over the past year, though, The Hardest remains his strongest performance. And finally, if you missed them when they popped up earlier this week, Hip Hop Giant has a collection of the "original" versions of Biggie's Ready To Die tracks (most of which have appeared on various mixtapes from Mister Cee, but this is the first time I've seen them all in one collection) and Unkut has the long-lost Native Tongues remix of Scenario. Now if I could just get my hands on that Kid Hood mixtape from 1990, my Native Tongues collection would finally be complete. Click here to read the rest of the article and download the track(s)...
