The new X-Files is what you expect, but not. Remember the good old days of early X-Files episodes which werent obsessed with the whole alien conspiracy theories, smoking men and Mulders daughter? The movie is like that and it works. Scully smokes up the screen, and together with Mulder they just make you wish you were an ex-FBI agent with time to kill. I really enjoyed it and although I may have been expecting a little more it was worth the whole $10 I spent on it (love those Hoyts Bluetooth prices!).  So, weve landed on Mars and are making little footprints with Phoenix craft. Theyve found evidence that water was there as well, and are now looking for the proof of life. Its pretty awesome if they find something. What do we call animals/organisms that exist on a planet other than ours? Its like a whole blank canvas and a spanking new planet we can destroy. Oh, and then some weird looking creature washed up on the beach in New York Looks convincing hey? Its most likely some viral marketing for a new Cartoon Network show called Cryptids, but damn, I wish it was real. Those little horns are cool, and is it just me or does it look like he is giving us the finger?
