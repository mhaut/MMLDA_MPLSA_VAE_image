...and you be the judge about who sounds more professional, or as Logan Murphy so succinctly put it, "presidential." The video above is supposed to be a parody, but it's a stark example of why Republicans generally are about as funny as 9-11. Back to the drawing board, people. By the way, how hilarious are the dopes who are interviewed in this thing? One can picture a nerdy, Karl Rove-like figure, offering them a hundred Euros off camera to read the cue cards. "I have a friend who's a Marxist who works for Obama!" Yea, that's so 1950. Calling Democrats pinko commies went out with the Eisenhower administration. This one is hardly better. I guess it's a sure sign of how desperate the McCain campaign has become - they are using Britney Spears (a nut job who couldn't even keep custody of her own kids) and Paris Hilton in their campaign ads. Then again, Hilton is the perfect Republican - someone who has done nothing for the money that she's earned, and who wants to do all she can to hold onto it. Har, har, har - my knee hurts I've slapped it so much watching these. On the flip-side, here's Obama's latest ad... The text in this ad says it all... Announcer: Hes practicing the politics of the past. John McCain. His attacks on Barack Obama: not true false baloney the low road baseless. John McCain. Same old politics. Same failed policies. Barack Obama supports a $1,000 middle class tax cut. An energy plan that takes on oil companies, develops alternative fuels, and breaks the grip of foreign oil. Thats change we can believe in. Obama: Im Barack Obama and I approve this message. Presidential, indeed.
