McCains latest ad, on health care, says he offers bold new solutions, not tired old politics. Should The Two really be using the phrase tired old? Today Bush addressed the annual meeting of the West Virginia Coal Association because No better group of people to talk about energy with than people who actually take risk to find energy. He was referring to people who risked capital, not black lung disease. THE ENERGY: I want to talk about the energy today. WHAT WE GOT TO DO: we got to work to have a comprehensive plan. I dont speak Broken English, but isnt the correct grammar we got to work to got a comprehensive plan? HES THE REMINDERER: And part of that sprint to the finish will be to continue to remind the American people that we need to be realistic and have common sense about todays energy needs and tomorrows energy needs. HES THE REMINDERER: I might remind you that in the beginning of my presidency there were some challenging times. HES THE REMINDERER: Now, its not as good as wed like it to be, but I want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter, not grow. OF COURSE ANYTHING MORE THAN ALL HIS FINGERS AND TOES SOUNDS LIKE A LOT TO HIM: We use about 1.1 billion tons of coal a year. That sounds like a lot to me. IN OTHER WORDS: Today my administration announced $36 million for new carbon capture projects. In other words, its more than just research. WHAT 250 YEARS OF RESERVES SHOULD SAY: Two hundred and fifty years is -- of reserves should say, gosh, were in good shape; we got energy available right here in the United States of America. WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE UTILIZING: We ought to be utilizing wind. IN OTHER WORDS: The problem is, is that theres a provision inserted into law that blocks oil shale leasing on federal lands. In other words, the federal lands that contain the oil shale, you cant lease them. IN OTHER WORDS: You can have a drilling site that protects the flora and the fauna, and explore in ways to get -- to be -- doesnt deplete your reservoir unnecessarily. In other words, we get oil and gas to the pipeline. INTERESTING BUT SAD (BUT NOT ACTUALLY A STATISTIC): One of the real problems we have is that we havent built a refinery in the United States in 30 years. Isnt that an interesting statistic? Its kind of a sad statistic WHAT WERE IN: Were in a interesting period of time. HES THE REMINDERER: I sometimes remind people that we have to buy oil from places where people dont particularly like us. I TRY NOT TO PRY INTO MY CARS SEX LIFE: I dont know if you pay attention to whether your car is flex-fuel or not, but that means you can either regular gasoline or ethanol. ER, RIGHT: And Im not sure how long its going to take, but dont be surprised if technological breakthroughs dont enable you to become gasoline producers. DICK CHENEY IS FUELED BY EATING BOTH (HE CALLS IT FLEX-FUEL): I talk a lot about our energy resources, but the best resource in America is the brain power and the optimism of the American people. WHAT GEORGE LOVES: Were a fabulous country. You know, I have seen America at its very best in seven and a half years. I marvel at the entrepreneurial spirit in our country. I love the fact that people go from nothing to something. Our small business owners are great people. I love the fact that weve got people who understand the dangers we face, understand were facing ideological people that use murder to achieve their objectives, and want to hurt us again here at home. I love the fact that whenever Bush forgets what he was talking about, he starts jibbering on about The War Against Terror (TWAT).
