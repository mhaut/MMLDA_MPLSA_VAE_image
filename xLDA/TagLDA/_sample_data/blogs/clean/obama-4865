Nothing like boots on the ground is there? But that is what we get do when we enlist the help of our friends. So PDAGV was there with my trusty camera. The same one that that brought you exclusive Bill Press, Obama Girl and Jim Hightower now allows you to meet Sherman Moreland. Mr Moreland is a former Horseheads Republican Committee Chairman and executive committee member of the Chemung County Republican party. You met him in a previous post now see him in person. It is a one minute clip. A slightly longer version is below the fold Note - this isn't the complete clip. the sound at the beginning of the clip was not as good as it could have been so here is a summary to give you a flavor of Mr. Moreland. He is an old Republican war horse. He has stumped for every Republican presidential candidate for 50 years (starting with Thomas Dewey) except for George W. Bush. Family dates back to U.S. Grant. He mentioned that in the 1960s town and village of Horseheads rated as one of the fastest growing communities in the U.S. It was populated by returning veterans. Party leaders recruited him to grow the party and he did well. ShareThis
