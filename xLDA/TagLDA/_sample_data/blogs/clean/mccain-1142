The Obama campaign is trying to back away from the ignorant lyrics contained on a new track by Ludacris called "Politics: Obama is Here", in which the rapper calls Hillary Clinton a "bitch" and says John McCain is "better off paralyzed in a wheelchair". Ludacris also takes swipes at President Bush and Jesse Jackson. Said Obama spokesman Bill Burton: "As Barack Obama has said many, many times in the past, rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny, materialism, and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to. This song is not only outrageously offensive to Senator Clinton, Reverend Jackson, Senator McCain, and President Bush, it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear. While Ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics." The song suggests the coming of Barack will "paint the White House black and I'm sure that's got 'em terrified..." Well, we've already gotten an idea of the kind of folks in the radical, Black Left Obama likes to hang out with. Indeed, the idea of a Barack presidency just gets scarier and scarier by the minute. You can listen to the song HERE.
