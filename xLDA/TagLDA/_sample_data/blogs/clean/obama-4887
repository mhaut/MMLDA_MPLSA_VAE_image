Part of me is really skeptical about teams abroad tapping into the U.S. youth soccer market. I mean, unless they naturalize a bunch of players, they can't bring over American prospects who don't meet work permit standards. It's all well and good to want to play in Europe, but generally, you have to do something here first before they want you over there.
