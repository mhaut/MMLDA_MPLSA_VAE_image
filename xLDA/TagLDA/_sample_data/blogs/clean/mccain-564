I cannot even consider this "negative" campaigning because it is just so non-sensical and downright bizarre. How is a man who is married to his very own "heiress" going to compare Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears? McCain had pledged to run a clean campaign, but like Mike Tyson when he's in the mood to munch ear, the Republicans just can't control themselves. First they tried to blame Barack Obama for the current price of energy, which is actually so high because Republicans have been in Big Oil's back pocket and in denial about the need for alternative energy programs on a Manhattan Project scale. Now they are comparing Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, apparently intending to suggest that he is a celebrity with no substance. WTF? Please try again!
