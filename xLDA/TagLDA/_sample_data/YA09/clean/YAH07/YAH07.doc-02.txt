This is a wonderful question. Thank you for asking.

In my opinion:
We can reduce corruption my automating/computerising lot of processes in India.

Idea1:
For example: In Andhra Pradesh. eSeva is a wonderful option for getting Driving License, pay A2 returns, getting commercial licenses. Applying for Passports. etc.,

This decreases the interaction with Govt employees, hence resulting in bringing down the corruption.
We need to computerise as many systems as possible. Lets make every possible thing as Self-Help option to Indian Citizens.

Idea2:
India needs privatization to improve the competition. Competition in service bring excellence. (Though this option is not so good considering Human factor, But why dont govt employees understand that Privatisation will happen just because of their in-competencies. They can avoid that if they work properly).

Idea3:
We need leaders in Govt Organisation who are self-motivated. Who are crazy enough to take india to heights. Just like the character in movie "Nayak". We need some young people working in govt organisations. Some Fresh MBA's.

Idea4:
In order to remove corruption from our country. We need to re-structure our entire education system. This will improve our country - overall.

Let me know if you have any input of yours.
