Corruption in India will reduce when everyone starts RESPECTING the law.

According to law, both the person who gives bribe and takes bribe are acting illegally and breaking the law.

Breaking the law is a simple thing for we Indians, not just with "bribe" we break the law, we break the law in everything we do!

My point is a CULTURAL change to start respecting the LAWS of OUR land. Forget who created the law, how it was created, a law is a law and should be followed.

When the person who respects and follows the law is considered a PATRIOT and whoever doesn't follow the law and disrespects it is considered as a TRAITOR, We will see India shining in the world map.

The person who follows and respects the law in India, is now considered as inefficient, stupid, unrealistic and obviously doesn't make enough money as a person who disrespects and breaks the law! THIS IS UNFAIR!
