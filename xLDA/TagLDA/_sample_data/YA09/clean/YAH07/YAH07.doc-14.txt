There needs to be a complete change in the way government authorities deal with public funds, complete transparency and accountability should be there.
Salary increase to government officials and special previlidges should be given to them. Also anybody found induleged in corruption should especially Police, Politicians, Income Tax Personnel, Various purchase departments, Railways, Posts, Defence Forces should be brought to proscecution in special courts which deliver judgement within 30 days of a personnel found corrupt. Also the property of corrupt people should be taken over by government and sold to generate money for other projects.

It is beleived that a sum of 35,000 crores is annually paid in India as bribe, this money is enough to completely eradicate hunger from India for 1 year.
Only solution is special task force, specia courts, same treatment to politicians and higher officials, rich or poor. Justice should be fast. Also please the government sector salaries need to be revised urgently to stop them from indulging in such activities.
