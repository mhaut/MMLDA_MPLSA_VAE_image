I think in INDIA we need a new and diffrent type of election in which huge population of india can select a person from every single state of INDIA who is :-

1. Corruption free
2. Whose past hitory in every single thing is white.
3. Well educated.
4. Person who has never ever used bulk of goverment
resources and money.
5. Person who is not like other leaders who blame other parties or other people for corruption and for other hazzards in the country.
6. Someone who understands the INDIAN law properly and gives respet to it instead of laughing on it.

and some other qualities. It means there will be 28 people in that group and those people can put the problems of curroption related to their states in front of other 27 members so that they can find the solutions.

And according to me solutions must be:-

1. Fire the curropt man/woman as soon as possible.
2. Must give ENOUGH freedom to the media and reporters
to hide the cameras and every thing to detect the guilty person and take action against them as soon as possible.
3. Put the curropt people in jail and take fine from them.

and many more ideas.

I know its bit difficult and long but........................ dont lose hope is the moral of the story.
