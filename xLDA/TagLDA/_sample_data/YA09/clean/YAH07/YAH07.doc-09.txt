we all know that India is a democracy.
Democracy is not the perfect type of government because somewhere down the line it has some poionts against it.
like:
1. Democracy is all about political competition and power play. There is no scope of morality.
2.Elected leaders do not know the best interest of the people.
3.Deocracy leads to corrupiton for its based on electoral competition.
(there are some more points but the dont deal with the topic.)

Keeping these points i think that India should have Dictatorship in which thre shoul be a mature, sensible and a nice ruler who does not often think of his interest.

But we should not forget that corruption can only end in India when people will start thinkin about there mother nation.
