The measures necessary to prevent the occurrence of such alleged activities in the future"
The restoration of mutual confidence amongst citizens inter-se, and between citizens and the State
The strengthening of the underpinnings of a just and democratic society
The elimination of alternative structure of command within the Police force and Grama Sevaka system is a prerequisite for prevention.

Senior Police officers have described to this Commission how an alternative structure came into being in the Police of officers junior in rank and rapidly promoted through political patronage who were used by politicians for their own ends. Enormous amounts had been paid illegally as "rewards" in contravention of the provisions of the Police Ordinance; and officers against whom the Supreme Court has made order for the payment of compensation for breach of fundamental rights had been further "rewarded" by these amounts being paid by the state, accompanied by a total absence of the recovery of these amounts from the person concerned. In this context we recommend:

The institution of disciplinary action against miscreants, including legal action, in the near future.
The identification of rules as regards the requisite qualifications for police officers and Grama Sevakas by a committe set up for that purpose, accompanied by the promulgation of a rule that future promotions of all officers will be decided on the basis of the possesion of the requisite qualification plus his record of past performance, with new recruitment to be strictly on the basis of the requisite qualifications.
A traning programme in investigations is urgently required for all police officers. The long years of recruitment and training of recruits as assistance to the military in border villages has resulted in a police force sadly deficient in the requisite skills in invistigation. Further, there was the sad spectacle of arbitratiness and an over-dependence on unreliable "informers" in the counter-subversive exercises in the south. It is essential that the reminder goes out to all levels of Police Force that they are valuable and indispensable only if they re-dedicated themselves to the proper police functions of investigations, public relations and the maintenance of law and order.

is necessary to reestablish the community-based forces and procedures to which the citizens can turn when faced with a possible misuser of police powers state power. Such community-based structures have a valuable part to play in the spheres both of monitoring and of prevention of such misuse. A Panel of Lay-Visitors for each police station area could serve this function.


- to speak to detainees

- to check conditions of detention

- to check records of tire police station in respect of a detention

- to liaise in the presentation of complaints to the police station

- to liaise with the SSP/DIG of the area

- to accompany persons to the police stations when requested to do so

- to make complaints themselves in a representative capacity, inclusive of impending problems

- the coordination at local level with the Human Rights Task Force(HRTF) could be an aspect of their work with importance for the restoration of Law and Order nationally.

A common and recurrent feature during the terror period was the lack of responsibility shown by law enforcement authorities to take action on complaints regarding 'disappearance'. This lack of action by the Autorities was seen even after judicial acknowledgement of 'disappearances' (The cases of Richard de Soyza and lawyer Liyanarachchi besides many others serve as illustrations).
Consequently, as a measure to prevent future occurrences of this kind of public unaccountability there is an imperative need for a separate institutional machinery to entertain and process complaints against excesses by police and armed personnel. A first step towards this has already been taken by Your Excellency's Government in the form of the establishment of a permanent Human Rights Commission. However we feel the need to give more teeth to this Commission so that it can serve the function of a more effective Human rights Watch, Accordingly we recommend that the Human rights Commission Act be amended by creating an independent investigating unit to inquire into complaints received by the Commission with adequate powers for that purpose.
In any event the existing agencies with their jurisdictional limitations (for example, 500 disappearances taking place in different parts of the country in a short period of time or the phenomenon of 500 disappearances in one part of the country over a year) and other constraints (complaints to police against police personnel) are not equipped to handle this type of situation expeditiously. What is required is a quick, effective and accountable agency to address the complaint without the need for an abated healing process through investigations conducted by Disappearance Commissions long after the event with attendant political overtones, Indeed, if there is an inbuilt mechanism to deal with human rights violations whatever thier magnitude as and if they arise it will serve as a Human Rights Watch. Such a Human Rights Watch would act as a deterrent, and is most likely to obviate the need to appoint ad hoc Commissions in the future.

Need to Create an Office of Independent Prosecutor.-

As a necessary adjunct to the measures recommended above we feel the need to create an office of an independent prosecutor with security of tenure (with a supporting staff) to institute prosecutions once evidence has been collected by the proposed investigating unit. The existing framework of the Attorney General's Office is not structured to fill this need. The Attorney General's function is to mount prosecutions and represent generally state officers in complaints against them. This appears to place that office in a paradoxical position. The sole concern of the proposed independent prosecutor's office would be to institute proceedings (criminal prosecutions) where the Human Rights Commission (with the assistance of its investigating unit) has found sufficient evidence for that purpose. We also recommend that while the salary of the proposed independent prosecutor be made a charge on the Consolidated Fund, the nomination to that office be made by and ratified by a Majority of the Members of Parliament.

CONCLUSION

The manifestation of the requisite political will by the reaffirmation of the state's commitment to human rights, the reaffirmation of the right to peaceful dissent, free and fair elections being held at regular periods, and the commitment to overall development irrespective of race, caste, religion or region, are an essential and integral part of the national reconciliation to which Your Excellency has already committed the state and the people.
