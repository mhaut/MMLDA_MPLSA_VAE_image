1920 the National Socialist German Workers’ Party renames the party. Hitler was appointed chief of propaganda and he realized that the party needed a powerful symbol to distinguish it and he makes his selection of the Hakenkreuz. (hooked cross)

what inspired Hitler to use the swastika as a symbol for the NSDAP was its use by the Thule-Gesellschaft [organization] since there were many connections between them and the DAP (...) from 1919 until the summer of 1921 Hitler used the special Nationalsozialistische library of Dr. Friedich Krohn, a very active member of the Thule-Gesellschaft, (...) Dr. Krohn was also the dentist from Sternberg who was named by Hitler in Mein Kampf as the designer of a flag very similar to one that Hitler designed in 1920 (...) during the summer of 1920, the first party flag was shown at Lake Tegernsee (...) these home-made (...) early flags were not preserved, the Ortsgruppe München flag was generally regarded as the first flag of the Party.

The one finally adopted (...) was designed by Dr. Friedrich Krohn, a dentist from Sternberg (...). Krohn's design, the swastika on a white disk against a red background, was intended to symbolize the ideology of the movement — in red its social ideal, in white its nationalism, and in the swastika "the struggle for the victory of Aryan man". But Krohn's flag featured a right-handed swastika, traditional symbol of good fortune, spiritual evalution and the triumph of spirit over matter. Hitler insisted on it being replaced by the left-handed swastika, regarded by occultists as the equivalent of a reversed crucifix, an evocation of evil, spiritual devolution and black magic!


A symbol it really is! In red we see the social ideal of the movement, in white the nationalist idea, in the swastika is the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man.
