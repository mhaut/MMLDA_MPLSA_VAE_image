just like any other party trying to adopt the other parties symbol hitler adopted the hindu symbol of swastika and reversed it for the reasons .the clear thing that was hoped why he choose the indian symbol was that he was in jail.at that time germany was in a weak position.he heard about the indian war of independence.and by its inspirstion he rose up and made germany a super power.so to honour indians he adopted the swastika.it is natural for a person to adopt other group's symbols.even the very famous symbol of illuminati was adopted by some groups.
