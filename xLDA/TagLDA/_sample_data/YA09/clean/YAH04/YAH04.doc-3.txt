1. I have a dedicated debit card that I use ONLY for online purchases, that I have designated my "Shopping Card". I only keep a minimal amount on that account just for shopping purposes. It also helps me keep me from impulse shopping.

2. I NEVER click on ANY link on an e-mail from ANYONE. I ALWAYS close out the e-mail and open my browser window and access the company site directly, or, my from my bookmarks or my favorites.

3. I changed the default administrator password on my Linksys wireless router since these passwords are published on the Internet. Anyone with a laptop or who lives near me in my neighborhood can access my broadband connection and access my account while I am logged in.

4. I NEVER give out my personal, account information to anyone unless I initiate the call, mail, e-mail or any other way of communicating it.

5. This isn't online, but photocopiers are now more sophistcated, being built with with HDD's (HarD Drives) and have network connectivity that save the information that is being photocopied. Imagine someone having access to your tax returns, birth certificates, financial statements, etc. So, I invested in my own copier and am very careful where I go to make copies.
