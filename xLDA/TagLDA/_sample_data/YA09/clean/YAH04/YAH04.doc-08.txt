Give out your personal information to a website you are not 300% confident about. If you just want information, and they insist on you giving them your personal info before they will let you access things like quotes or want other personal data - be pro-active and make up a false identity. Give out this information instead of your real identity until you are completely certain that you really want to do business with the company. Yahoo, google and other companies offer free e-mail accounts. Set one up so that you can use it to keep the "spam" from these inquiries out of your main e-mailbox as well.

Do not store your credit card numbers, account numbers, passwords or personal I.D. numbers on any computer that may be connected to the internet. Just don't do it. Keep a secure "hard copy" file at home, and shred anything before you put it into your trash barrel. Shredding it, then pouring bacon grease leavings on it is even better.

Change your passwords at irregular intervals and do not allow any one else to use your account(s).

If you get an e-mail from a company you do business with, threatening to turn off your account or charge you in some way if you do not "click on this link and verify some information", delete the e-mail immediately and telephone the company to discuss this. 99.999% of the time it is a phishing scam.

Carefully read any e-mail you recieve from banks, credit card companies, e-bay, paypal or other companies you may have financial dealings with. Look very carefully for grammar and spelling errors, or improper usage. Many of these scam "artists" can easily reproduce the "look" of a legitimate e-mail, but fall down on things like spelling and grammar. Again, if there is any request for your personal information, pick up the telephone and CALL the company. Do not EVER click through on a link from an e-mail.
