First of all before complaining about the politician or demanding transparency in the working of the government....every pupil of this country should feel the need to change themselves....we speak about corruption,but how many of us have protested....it is the public who assist the act of corruption by giving bribe.If everyone of us had taken the right step towards abolishing corruption,things would have changed long before.Its very difficult even for a mean politician to change things, given the present mindset of the people.So lets all first take an oath to follow the rules without questioning its validity.As long it is there in the law book it ought to be followed.If you think its ought to be modified then file a law suit and advocate for it.Now again don't complaint that judiciary is corrupted.If we have to change things,the path that we shud take will be very tough,but albeit we have to do that sacrifice to taste the glory of being a superpower.so remember its the public who have to cooperate and not the handful population of politician who can change things in a fortnight.so the next step that we shud take towards the goal is simple.just follow the rules.everything else will follow........
