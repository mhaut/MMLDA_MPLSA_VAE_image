ALL INDIAN POLITICIANS SHOULD BECOME HONEST TOWARDS NATION. THEY SHOULD CHANGE OLD CONSTITUTION AND BRING AMENDMENTS TO OLD CONSTITUTION.

ALL THE PERSONS WORKING IN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT THEY ARE PAID.

PLEASE TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF LALU YADAV OUR RAILWAY MINISTER. HE HAS BROUGHT THE RAILWAYS
IN PROFITS. THIS THING HE COULD HAVE DONE IN BIHAR TOO WHEN HE WAS CHIEF MINISTER.

ALSO OUR POLITICIAN SHOULD TAKE LESSON FROM MUMBAI DABBAWALAS. THEY DELIVER DABBAS IN WHOLE MUMBAI WITHOUT ERROR FROM LAST 100 YEARS.

THEY ARE NOT EDUCATED BUT THEY ARE DEDICATED TO THEIR WORK TOTALLY AND WHOLLY. THEY WERE INVITED TO ATTEND THE WEDDING OF PRINCE CHARLS BUT NO INDIAN POLITICIAN WAS INVITED.

SO ONLY TWO STEPS 1ST HONESTY AND 2ND DEDICATION OF OUR ELECTED LEADERS WILL BRING THIS COUNTRY TO BECOME SUPER POWER.
