We are naive to call the Gurgaon incident as a watershed of sorts. Violence has always existed in schools, colleges and stabbings, gangfights stopped raising eyebrows eons ago. Use of a firearm is the only novelty this time which only underscores the abyssmally low value on human life.
it is silly to expect Govt. to solve societal doublespeak. In the indo gangetic plain the number of illicit firearms outnumber all the weapons held by the police! even in this age it is a hallmark of prestige in this belt to fire volleys in baraat processions. Let us not forget that our children of any religious calling are weaned on gory mythology of violence and small boys rich or poor get a toy gun even before they can speak.In contrast even possesion of a toy gun is banned in Singapore.
the answer is in better parenting,metamorphosis of the guru- shishya relationship into a friend and guide interaction and exemplary punishment including debarring admission in any educational institution in the country for a period of three years with two more years of probation for any violence on the campus
this has to be coupled with handsome incentives for academic excellence,in sports and evoving an enforceable student leadership organisation which can polce the students with authority. definitely not linked to student unions but can be selected by school authorities/PTAs from panels nominated by students
