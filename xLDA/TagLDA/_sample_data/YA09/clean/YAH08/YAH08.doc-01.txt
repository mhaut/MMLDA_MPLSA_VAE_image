It is indeed a sorry state of devaluation of ethical values,now no longer being taught any where including schools and homes. The parents are themselves captive of materialistic world, devoid of real sense of human values like compassion, love, care of weak, destitute, old and disabled. Everywhere, it is money and status which counts and schools like Euro International Public School are no exception. In such a scenario there is an express need to inculcate ethical values in parents and children as well. For this purpose, in schools, there should be a period when ethical values by way of stories, movies, cartoons and discussions should be taught. There children should be encouraged to express their minds freely and hear others. This should eventually become a platform where once in a month teachers and parents should also participate and attend attentively to their wards views, their worries, concerns, hopes, fears openly being expressed.
Thus a safety valve will evolve to clean minds of our children from the very beginning and help them to develop the fine qualities of heart and mind.
