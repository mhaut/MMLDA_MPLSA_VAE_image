The '''Croatian War of Independence''' was fought from 1991 to 1995 between forces loyal to the government of [[Croatia]]&mdash;which had declared independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFR Yugoslavia)&mdash;and the Serb-controlled [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and [[Serbs of Croatia|local Serb]] forces, with the JNA ending its combat operations in Croatia by 1992. In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], the war is primarily referred to as the ''Homeland War'' ({{lang-hr|Domovinski rat}}) and also as ''Greater-Serbian aggression'' ({{lang-hr|Velikosrpska agresija}}).<ref name="HRV-name-VSA-Bilandžija"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et112.html|title= The period of Croatia within ex-Yugoslavia (1918-1941, 1945-1991)|author= Zubrinic, Darko|date=1995|publisher= croatianhistory.net|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}</ref> In the Serbian language, the phrase ''War in Croatia'' ({{lang-sr|Rat u Hrvatskoj}}) is the most common name.<ref name="B92-RUH">{{cite web |title= Srbija-Hrvatska, temelj stabilnosti | trans_title= Serbia-Croatia, foundation of stability | language= Serbian | url= http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/kaziprst.php?yyyy=2010&mm=11&nav_id=470273 | publisher=[[B92]] | date= November 4, 2010 | accessdate= December 22, 2010}}</ref>

Initially, the war was waged between Croatian police forces and Serbs living in the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia#1990 - 1991|Republic of Croatia]], a constituent republic of SFR Yugoslavia at the time.

The war in [[Croatia]] resulted from the rise of nationalism in the 1980s which slowly led to the dissolution of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. A crisis emerged in Yugoslavia with the weakening of the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist states in Eastern Europe]] towards the end of the [[Cold War]], as symbolized by the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. In Yugoslavia, the national communist party, officially called the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], had lost its ideological potency.<ref name="Pešić-USIP-LCY-potency">{{cite journal | publisher = [[United States Institute for Peace]] | url = http://www.usip.org/publications/serbian-nationalism-and-origins-yugoslav-crisis | title = Serbian Nationalism and the Origins of the Yugoslav Crisis | author= Vesna Pešić | authorlink=Vesna Pešić | journal= Peaceworks | issue= 8 | page= 12 |month = April | year= 1996 | accessdate= December 10, 2010}}</ref>

As Slovenia and Croatia began to seek greater autonomy within the federation, including [[confederation|confederate]] status and even full independence, the nationalist ideas started to grow within the ranks of the still-ruling League of Communists.

In March 1989, the crisis in Yugoslavia deepened after the adoption of amendments to the Serbian constitution that allowed the Serbian republic's government to re-assert effective power over the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Up until that time, a number of political decisions were legislated from within these provinces, and they had a vote on the [[List of heads of state of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federal presidency]] level (six members from the republics and two members from the autonomous provinces).<ref>{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Yugoslavia (Former): Political Innovation and the 1974 Constitution (chapter 4) | url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html#yu0130 | publisher= The Library of Congress| accessdate= January 27, 2011}}</ref> Serbia, under President Slobodan Milošević, gained control over three out of eight votes in the Yugoslav presidency, and this was used on May 16, 1991, when the Serbian parliament exchanged [[Riza Sapunxhiu]] and [[Nenad Bućin]], representatives of Kosovo and Vojvodina, for [[Jugoslav Kostić]] and [[Sejdo Bajramović]].<ref name="Mesić33">Mesić 2004, p. 33</ref> The fourth vote was provided by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], whose government survived a [[coup d'état]] in October 1988,<ref>{{cite news|author= Henry Kamm |authorlink = Henry Kamm |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1239F93AA35753C1A96E948260&scp=26&sq=Montenegro+protest&st=nyt |title=Yugoslav Police Fight Off A Siege In Provincial City |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 9, 1988 |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> but not a second one in January 1989.<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D9123FF931A25752C0A96F948260&scp=2&sq=Titograd&st=nyt |title=Leaders of a Republic In Yugoslavia Resign |newspaper= The New York Times |date=January 12, 1989 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref> Once Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes, it was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, because unfavorable decisions could be blocked; this rendered the governing body ineffective.

===Electoral and constitutional moves===

The weakening of the communist regime allowed nationalism to spread its political presence, even within the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In 1989, political parties were allowed and a number of them had been founded, including the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica}}) (HDZ), led by [[Franjo Tuđman]], who later became the first [[president of Croatia]].<ref name="Guardian-Tuđman-Obituary">{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html | title = Obituary: Franjo Tudjman | author= Branka Magas | date = December 13, 1999 | accessdate= December 11, 2010}}</ref> Tuđman made international visits during the late 1980s to garner support from the [[Croatian diaspora]] for the Croatian national cause.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/tudmana-je-posjeta-americi-1987-trebao-ubiti-srpski-vojni-likvidator-clanak-64356 | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Večernji list]] | publisher= [[Styria Media Group]] | author= Ivica Radoš | title = Tuđmana je za posjeta Americi 1987. trebao ubiti srpski vojni likvidator | trans_title = During his visit to America in 1987, Tuđman was supposed to have been killed by a Serbian military assassin | date = December 9, 2009 | accessdate = October 8, 2010}}</ref> 

In January 1990, the League of Communists broke up on the lines of the individual republics. At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, on January 20, 1990, the delegations of the republics could not agree on the main issues in the Yugoslav federation. The Croatian and Slovenian delegations demanded a looser federation, while the Serbian delegation, headed by Milošević, opposed this. As a result, the Slovenian and Croatian delegates left the Congress.<ref name="Pauković-14Congress-2009">{{cite journal | author= Davor Pauković | publisher = Centar za politološka istraživanja | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=55640 | language= Croatian | title= Posljednji kongres Saveza komunista Jugoslavije: uzroci, tijek i posljedice raspada | trans_title = Last Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia: Causes, Consequences and Course of Dissolution (English language summary title) | date= June 1, 2008 | journal= Časopis za suvremenu povijest | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | pages= 21–33 | format= PDF | issn= 1847-2397 | accessdate= December 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name="LondonTimes-Račan-Obituary">{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Times]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1722946.ece | title = Ivica Racan | date = April 30, 2007 | accessdate= December 11, 2010}}</ref>

In February 1990, [[Jovan Rašković]] founded the [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]] (SDS) in [[Knin]]. Its program stated that the "regional division of Croatia is outdated" and that it "does not correspond with the interest of Serb people".<ref name="g214">Goldstein 1999, p. 214</ref> The party program endorsed redrawing regional and municipal lines to reflect the ethnic composition of the areas, and asserted the right of territories with a "special ethnic composition" to become autonomous.

It topped the poll in the elections (followed by [[Ivica Račan]]'s reformed communists, [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]]) and was set to form a new [[Croatian Government]].<ref name="NYTimes-Elections2-HRV1990"/>

A tense atmosphere prevailed in 1990, and especially so during the period immediately before the elections. On May 13, 1990, a [[Dinamo Zagreb-Red Star Belgrade riot|football game was held in Zagreb]] between [[Zagreb]]'s [[Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo]] team and Belgrade's [[Red Star Belgrade|Crvena Zvezda]] team. The game erupted into violence between football fans and police.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |title= Day When Maksimir Stadium Went up in Flames |publisher=Dalje.com | date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

On May 30, 1990, the new [[Croatian Parliament]] held its first session. President Tuđman announced his manifesto for a new Constitution (ratified at the end of the year) and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, notably to what extent minority rights (mainly for Serbs) would be guaranteed. Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution on the grounds that the local Serb population would be threatened. Their prime concern was that a new constitution would not henceforth designate Croatia a "national state of the [[Croats|Croatian people]], a state of the Serbian people, and any other people living in it" but a "national state of the Croatian people and any people living in it".<ref name="icty babic2"/> In 1991, Serbs represented 12.2 percent of the total population of Croatia, but they held a disproportionate number of official posts: 17.7 percent of appointed officials in Croatia, including police, were Serbs. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier on, which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime.<ref name="Bjelajac-Žunec-239"/> After HDZ came to power, some of the Serbs employed in public administration, especially the police, lost their jobs and were replaced by Croats.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143561/Croatia/223957/Croatia-in-Yugoslavia-1945-91?anchor=ref476690 | title= Croatia in Yugoslavia, 1945-91 | work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref>

The Serbs within Croatia did not initially seek independence before 1990. On July 25, 1990, a Serbian Assembly was established in [[Srb]], north of Knin, as the political representation of the Serbian people in Croatia. The Serbian Assembly declared "sovereignty and
autonomy of the Serb people in Croatia".<ref name="icty babic2">{{cite web |title=The Prosecutor vs. Milan Martic (paragraph 127-150) | author=ICTY  |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612.pdf |publisher=ICTY |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> On December 21, 1990, the [[SAO Krajina]] was proclaimed by the municipalities of the regions of Northern [[Dalmatia]] and [[Lika]], in south-western Croatia.

Croatian government property throughout the region was increasingly controlled by local Serb municipalities or the newly established "Serbian National Council". This would later become the government of the breakaway [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK).<ref name="icty babic2"/>

In August 1990, an unrecognized mono-ethnic referendum was held in regions with a substantial Serb population which would later become known as the RSK (bordering western [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) on the question of Serb "sovereignty and autonomy" in Croatia.<ref name="NYTimes-Minority-AUG1990">{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/07/world/serb-minority-seek-role-in-a-separate-croatia.html?ref=croatia | author= Chuck Sudetic | authorlink= Chuck Sudetic | title = Serb Minority Seek Role in a Separate Croatia | date = August 7, 1990 | accessdate= December 11, 2010}}</ref> This was an attempt to counter the changes in the constitution.

The Serbs felled pine trees or used bulldozers to block roads to seal off towns like Knin and [[Benkovac]] near the [[Adriatic coast]]. On August 18, 1990, the Serbian newspaper ''[[Večernje novosti]]'' said almost "two million Serbs were ready to go to Croatia to fight".<ref name="NYTimes-Log-19AUG1990"/>

Immediately after the [[Slovenian independence referendum, 1990|Slovenian referendum on independence]] and the new Croat constitution, the JNA announced that a new defense doctrine would apply across the country.

The JNA was initially formed during World War II to carry out [[guerrilla warfare]] against occupying [[Axis powers|Axis forces]]. The success of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan movement]] led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla warfare, as its plans normally entailed defending against [[NATO]] or [[Warsaw Pact]] attacks, where other types of warfare would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a [[Military doctrine#Territorial Defense Forces|Territorial Defense system]].<ref name="Istorija20veka-2-2006">{{cite journal | publisher = Institut za savremenu istoriju | location= Belgrade | url = http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0352-3160/2006/0352-31600602087R.pdf | format= PDF | title = Vežba Avala—Jugoslovenska odbrana od Varšavskog pakta 1968. godine | trans_title= The Avala exercise—Yugoslav defense from the Warsaw Pact in 1968 (English language summary title) | language= Serbian | author= Aleksandar Radić | journal= Istorija 20. veka | year= 2006 | issue= 2 | issn= 0352-3160 | accessdate= December 16, 2010}}</ref>

On paper, the JNA seemed a powerful force, with 2,000 [[tank]]s and 300 [[jet aircraft]] (all either [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] or locally produced). However, by 1991, the majority of this equipment was 30 years old, as the force consisted primarily of [[T-54/55]] tanks and [[MiG-21]] aircraft.<ref name="Western European Union107">Western European Union 1986, p. 107</ref> Still, the JNA operated around 300 [[M-84]] tanks (a Yugoslav version of the Soviet [[T-72]]) and a sizable fleet of [[ground-attack aircraft]], such as the [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb]] and the [[Soko J-22 Orao]], whose armament included [[AGM-65 Maverick]] guided missiles.<ref name="Finlan20-21">Finlan 2004, pp. 20-21</ref> By contrast, more modern cheap anti-tank missles (like the [[9M113 Konkurs|AT-5]]) and anti-aircraft missles (like the [[SA-14]]) were abundant and were designed to destroy much more advanced weaponry. Before the war the JNA had 169,000 regular troops, including 70,000 professional [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s. The fighting in Slovenia brought about a great number of desertions, and the army responded by mobilizing Serbian reserve troops. Approximately 100,000 evaded the [[Conscription|draft]], and the new conscripts proved an ineffective fighting force. The JNA resorted to reliance on [[Paramilitary|irregular militias]].<ref name="NYTimes-Troop-Shortages">{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/23/world/brutal-impasse-yugoslav-war-special-report-yugoslav-ethnic-hatreds-raise-fears.html?ref=croatia | title = Yugoslav Ethnic Hatreds Raise Fears of a War Without an End | author= Stephen Engelberg | date = December 23, 1991 | accessdate= December 16, 2010}}</ref> Paramilitary units like [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]], [[Serbian Guard (paramilitary)|Serbian Guard]], Dušan Silni, and [[Serb Volunteer Guard]], which committed a number of massacres against Croat and other non-Serbs civilians, were increasingly used by the Yugoslav and Serb forces.<ref name="B92-Lovas">{{cite web |title= 69 hrvatskih civila ubijeno u Lovasu u oktobru 1991. | trans_title= 69 Croatian civilians killed in Lovas in October 1991 | language= Serbian | url= http://www.b92.net/info/dokumenti/index.php?nav_id=466651 | publisher=B92 | date= October 20, 2010 | accessdate= December 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name="un"/> In addition, there were foreign fighters supporting the RSK, most of them from Russia.<ref name="UN-Foreign-fighters">{{cite web | publisher = United Nations | url = http://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/50/plenary/a50-390add1.htm | title = Use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination - Note by the Secretary-General | date = August 29, 1995 | accessdate= January 23, 2011}}</ref> With the retreat of the JNA forces in 1992, JNA units were reorganized as the [[Army of Serb Krajina]], which was a direct heir to the JNA organization, with little improvement.<ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire">{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/03/world/yugoslav-factions-agree-to-un-plan-to-halt-civil-war.html?ref=croatia | title = Yugoslav Factions Agree to U.N.

The [[Military of Croatia|Croatian military]] was in a much worse state than that of the Serbs. In the early stages of the war, lack of military units meant that the [[Croatian Police]] force would take the brunt of the fighting. The [[Croatian National Guard]] ({{lang-hr|Zbor narodne garde}}), the new Croatian military, was formed on April 11, 1991, and gradually developed into the [[Croatian Army]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska vojska}}) by 1993.<ref name="EE-CIS-book"/> Weaponry was in short supply, and many units were formed either unarmed or with obsolete World War II-era rifles. The Croatian Army had only a handful of tanks, including World War II-surplus vehicles such as the [[T-34]], and its air force was in an even worse state, consisting of only a few Antonov [[An-2]] [[biplane]] [[Agricultural aircraft|crop-dusters]] that had been converted to drop makeshift bombs.<ref name="An2-Mader">{{cite journal | author= Georg Mader | publisher = Aerospace Publishing | location= London | title= Croatia's embargoed air force | year= 2006 | journal= World Air Power Journal | volume= 24 | issue = Spring | page= 145 | isbn= 1-874023-66-2}}</ref> However, since the soldiers were defending their homeland and their families, the army was very motivated.

In August 1991, the Croatian Army had fewer than 20 [[brigade]]s.

The [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of the Interior]] consequently started arming an increasing amount of [[special police]] forces, and this led to the building of a real army.

On May 15, [[Stjepan Mesić]], a Croat, was scheduled to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at the time under Serbian control, upped the ante by blocking the move, otherwise seen as largely ceremonial.

Some of the 37 independent battalions also consisted of career soldiers.

While Serbia and Croatia never declared war on each other, Serbia was directly and indirectly involved in the war through a number of activities.<ref name="NYT-undeclared-08Jan1992"/> Its foremost involvement entailed material support of the JNA.

This degree of control was reflected in negotiations held at various times between Croatian authorities and the RSK, as Serbian leadership (Milošević) was regularly consulted and frequently made decisions on behalf of the RSK.<ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"/> Most significantly, the Erdut Agreement that ended the war was signed by a RSK minister on instructions from Milošević.<ref name="NYTimes-ErdutAgr-12Nov95"/><ref name="COE-CroatiaReport-Milanović"/><ref name="ICTY-Milošević-trial-Milanović"/> The degree of control Serbia held over SFR Yugoslavia and later RSK was later evidenced through testimonies during Milošević trial at the ICTY.<ref name="Jović-icty-statement"/><ref name="COE-CroatiaReport-Milanović"/><ref name="ICTY-Milošević-trial-Milanović"/>
