==History==
{{Main|History of Italy}}

===Etymology===
The assumptions on the etymology of the name "Italia" are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide.<ref name= Manco>Alberto Manco, ''Italia. Disegno storico-linguistico'', 2009, Napoli, L'Orientale, ISBN 978-88-95044-62-0</ref> According to one of the more common explanations, the term ''[[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]]'', from {{lang-lat|Italia}},<ref>[[Oxford Latin Dictionary|OLD]], p. 974: "first syll. naturally short (cf. [[Quintilian|Quint.]]''Inst.''1.5.18), and so scanned in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[[Gaius Lucilius|Lucil.]]</span>825, but in dactylic verse lengthened ''metri gratia''."</ref> was borrowed through [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] from the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''Víteliú'', meaning "land of young cattle" (''cf.'' [[Latin|Lat]] ''vitulus'' "calf", [[Umbrian language|Umb]] ''vitlo'' "calf")<!-- and named for the god of cattle, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] -->.<ref>J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24.</ref> The bull was a symbol of the southern Italian tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the [[Samnite Wars]]. [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after [[Italus]],<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 
''Roman Antiquities'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html 1.35], on LacusCurtius</ref> mentioned also by [[Aristotle]]<ref>Aristotle, ''Politics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b#note-link2 7.1329b], on Perseus</ref> and [[Thucydides]].<ref>Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 6.2.4], on Perseus</ref>

The name ''Italia'' originally applied only to a part of what is now [[Southern Italy]]—according to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the southern portion of the [[Bruttium]] peninsula (modern [[Calabria]]). But by his time [[Oenotria]] and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name "Italia" to a larger region, but it was not until the time of the Roman conquests that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula.<ref>Pallottino, M., History of Earliest Italy, trans.

Ancient Rome was at first a small agricultural community founded c. the 8th century BC that grew over the course of the centuries into a colossal [[Roman empire|empire]] encompassing the whole [[Mediterranean Sea]], in which [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman cultures merged into one civilization.  This civilization was so influential that parts of it survive in modern [[law]], [[Central Administration|administration]], [[philosophy]] and [[arts]], forming the ground that [[Western world|Western civilization]] is based upon. In a slow decline since the late 4th century AD, the empire finally broke into two parts in 395 AD: the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The western part under the pressure of [[Goths]] finally dissolved, leaving the Italian peninsula divided into small independent kingdoms and feuding [[city state]]s for the next 1,300 years, and leaving the [[Byzantine Empire|eastern part]] sole heir to the Roman legacy.

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Italy in the Middle Ages}}

[[File:Naval Jack of Italy.svg|thumb|right|Coats of arms of the four [[Maritime Republics]]. Clockwise, starting from the upper left: [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]].]]

In the 6th century the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] reconquered Italy from the [[Ostrogoths]]. The invasion of a new wave of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the [[Lombards]], doomed his attempt to resurrect the [[Western Roman Empire]] but the repercussions of Justinian's failure resounded further still. For the next 13th centuries, whilst new [[nation-state]]s arose in the lands north of the Alps, the Italian political landscape was a patchwork of feuding [[city state]]s, petty tyrannies, and foreign invaders.

It was during this vacuum of authority that the region saw the rise of the [[Signoria]] and the [[medieval commune|Comune]]. In the anarchic conditions that often prevailed in medieval Italian city-states, people looked to strong men to restore order and disarm the feuding elites. Italy during this period was also characterized by its merchant [[Republics]]. These city-states, [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] in reality, had a dominant merchant class which under relative [[freedom (political)|freedom]] nurtured academic and artistic advancement. The four classic [[Repubbliche Marinare|Maritime Republics]] in Italy were [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]] and [[Amalfi]]. Venice and Genoa were Europe's gateways to trade with the East, with the former producer of the renowned [[venetian glass]]. Florence was the capital of [[silk]], [[wool]], banks and [[jewelry]]. The Maritime Republics were heavily involved in the [[Crusades]], taking advantage of the new political and trading opportunities, most evidently in the conquest of [[Zadar|Zara]] and [[Constantinople]] funded by Venice.

===Renaissance (15–16th century)===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance}}

[[File:God2-Sistine Chapel.png|thumb|left|250px|''[[The Creation of Adam|Creation of Adam]]'' by [[Michelangelo]].]]

The [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] in 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing one third of the population.<ref>Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, "The Biggest Epidemics of History" (La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire, in L'Histoire n°310, June 2006, pp.45–46</ref><ref>"[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/effects/death_toll.shtml Plague]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}". Brown.edu.</ref> However, the recovery from the disaster of the Black Death led to a resurgence of cities, trade and economy which greatly stimulated the successive phase of the [[Humanism]] and [[Renaissance]], that best known for its cultural achievements. Accounts of [[Renaissance literature]] usually begin with [[Petrarch]] (best known for the elegantly polished vernacular [[sonnet]] sequence of the ''[[Canzoniere]]'' and for the craze for book collecting that he initiated) and his friend and contemporary [[Boccaccio]] (author of the [[Decameron]]). Famous vernacular poets of the 15th century include the renaissance epic authors [[Luigi Pulci]] ([[Morgante]]), [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] ([[Orlando Innamorato]]), and [[Ludovico Ariosto]] ([[Orlando Furioso]]). 15th century writers such as the poet [[Poliziano]] and the Platonist philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] made extensive translations from both Latin and Greek. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]] (''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'') laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady, while [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "''la verita effetuale delle cose''"{{mdash}}the actual truth of things{{mdash}}in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, humanist style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. [[Italian Renaissance painting]] exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting (see [[Western painting]]) for centuries afterwards, with artists such as [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Titian]]. The same is true for [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], as practiced by [[Brunelleschi]], [[Leone Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Bramante]]. Their works include [[Florence Cathedral]], [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in Rimini (to name a only a few, not to mention many splended private residences: see [[Renaissance architecture]]). Finally, the Aldine Press, founded by the printer [[Aldo Manuzio]], active in Venice, developed [[Italic type]] and the small, relatively portable and inexpensive printed book that could be carried in one's pocket, as well as being the first to publish editions of books in Ancient Greek.

===Foreign domination and Napoleonic Wars (17th–19th centuries)===

{{Main|History of Italy (1559–1814)}}

[[File:Flag of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]].]]

The history of Italy in the [[Early Modern period]] was characterized by foreign domination: following the [[Italian Wars]] (1494 to 1559), Italy saw a long period of relative peace, first under [[Habsburg Spain]] (1559 to 1713) and then under [[Habsburg Austria]] (1713 to 1796).

The [[Black Death]] repeatedly returned to haunt Italy throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. The plague of 1575–77 claimed some 50,000 victims in [[Venice]].<ref>[http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/preparedness/bt_public_history_plague.shtm History of Plague], Texas Department of State Health Services</ref> In the first half of the 17th century a plague claimed some 1,730,000 victims, or about 14% of Italy’s population.<ref>Karl Julius Beloch, ''Bevölkerungsgeschichte Italiens'', volume 3, pp. 359–360.</ref> The [[Great Plague of Milan]] occurred from 1629 through 1631 in northern Italy, with the cities of [[Lombardy]] and [[Venice]] experiencing particularly high death rates. In 1656 the plague killed about half of [[Naples]]' 300,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/goldenage.htm |title=Naples in the 1600s |publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu |date= |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the northern part of the country was invaded and reorganized as a new [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|kingdom of Italy]], that was a [[client state]] of the [[Napoleonic France|French Empire]] from 1796 to 1814, while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by [[Joachim Murat]], Napoleon's brother in law, that was crowned as [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814) restored the situation of the late 18th century, which was however quickly overturned by the incipient movement of [[Italian unification]].

===Italian unification and Liberal Italy (1861–1922)===
{{Main|Italian unification|Italy in World War I}}

[[File:With Victor Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Victor Emmanuel II]].]]

The creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]]. In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|war was declared]] on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] led the Italian republican drive for unification in southern Italy,<ref>(Mack Smith, Denis (1997). ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. ISBN 0-472-10895-6, p. 15.</ref> while the northern Italian monarchy of the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], had the ambition of establishing a united Italian state under its rule. The kingdom successfully challenged the [[Austrian Empire]] in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] with the help of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], liberating the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]]. It established [[Turin]] as capital of the newly formed state. In 1865 the capital was moved to [[Florence]].

In 1866, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] aligned the kingdom with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annex Venice. In 1870, as France during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] abandoned its positions in Rome, Italy rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the [[Papal State]] from French sovereignty. [[File:Italia-I-Guerra-Mondiale-fanti-classe-1888.jpg|thumb|right|Italian infantrymen in 1916. More than 650,000 Italian soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of [[World War I]].]] Italian unification finally was achieved, and shortly afterwards Italy's capital was moved from [[Florence]] to Rome. Whilst keeping the monarchy, the government became a parliamentary system, dominated by the [[liberalism|liberals]].

As [[Northern Italy]] became [[industrialized]] and [[modernized]], [[Southern Italy]] and rural areas of the north remained under-developed and stagnant, forcing millions of people to migrate to the emerging [[Economy of Italy|Industrial Triangle]] or abroad. The Sardinian [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, extended to the whole [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861, provided for basic freedoms, but the electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative organisations. The highest point of [[Italian diaspora|Italian emigration]] was reached in 1913, when 872,598 persons left Italy.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Monticelli |first = Giuseppe Lucrezio |title = Italian Emigration: Basic Characteristic and Trends with Special Reference to the Last Twenty Years. |journal = International Migration Review |volume = 1 |issue = 3, Special issue, The Italian Experience in Emigration |pages = 10–24 |date = Summer, 1967 |id= ISSN 01979183 |doi = 10.2307/3002737 |url = http://jstor.org/stable/3002737 |publisher = The Center for Migration Studies of New York, Inc.}}</ref>

Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]] and later [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese]] under its rule.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), pp. 49.)</ref> During [[World War I]], Italy at first stayed neutral but in 1915 signed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], entering [[Triple Entente|Entente]] on the promise of receiving [[Trento]], [[Trieste]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Istria]] and northern [[Dalmatia]] from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], as well as parts of [[Ottoman Empire]].

Under the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Peace Treaties of Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy obtained most of the promised territories, including the town of [[Rijeka|Fiume]]. Nevertheless, the victory was described as "mutilated" by the nationalists, since most of Dalmatia was assigned to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

===Fascist Italy (1922–1945)===

{{Main|Italian Fascism|Italy in World War II}}

[[File:Hitler and Mussolini June 1940.jpg|thumb|Benito Mussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1940.]]

The turbulence that followed the devastation of World War I, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], led to turmoil and anarchy. The liberal establishment, fearing a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the fascists attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]] (the ''Marcia su Roma'', "[[March on Rome]]"), supported by king [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship. In 1935, Mussolini invaded [[Ethiopia]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]. Consequently, Italy allied with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported Franco in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy occupied [[Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades, and entered [[World War II]] in 1940 on the side of the [[Axis powers]]. Mussolini, wanting a quick victory like Hitler's [[Blitzkrieg]]s in Poland and France, invaded [[Greek-Italian War|Greece]] in October 1940 but was forced to accept a humiliating stalemate after a few months. At the same time, Italy, after initially conquering [[British Somalia]] and parts of [[Egypt]], saw an allied counter-attack lead to the loss of all possessions in the [[Horn of Africa]] and in [[North Africa]].

Italy was then [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|invaded by the Allies]] in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini. In September 1943, Italy [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|surrendered]]. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield for the rest of the war]], as the allies were moving up from the south as the north was the base for loyalist Italian fascist and German Nazi forces, fought also by the [[Italian resistance movement]]. The Nazis left the country on 25 April 1945 and the remaining Italian fascist forces eventually disbanded. Nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) died in the conflict,<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy Italy]". Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> and  the Italian economy had been all but destroyed; per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>Adrian Lyttelton (editor), ''"Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900–1945"'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 13</ref>

===Italian Republic (1946–present)===
{{Main|History of the Italian Republic}}
[[File:Partisans in Milan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Italian resistance movement|Partisans]] parading in [[Milan]] after the liberation of the city in 1945.]]

In 1946, [[Victor Emmanuel III]]'s son, [[Umberto II]], was forced to abdicate. [[Birth of the Italian Republic|Italy became a republic]] after a [[Referendum in Italy|referendum]] held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as [[Republic Day (Italy)|Republic Day]]. This was also the first time that Italian women were entitled to vote.<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.insmli.it/pubblicazioni/35/Voto%20donne%20versione%20def.pdf Italia 1946: le donne al voto, dossier a cura di Mariachiara Fugazza e Silvia Cassamagnaghi]</ref> The Republican Constitution was approved and came into force on 1 January 1948. Under the [[Paris Peace Treaties]] of 1947, the eastern border area was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and, later, the free territory of [[Trieste]] was divided between the two states.

Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible [[Communist]] takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948 when the [[Christian Democracy (Italy, historical)|Christian Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], won the election with 48 percent of the vote.
In the 1950s Italy became a member of [[NATO]] and allied itself with the United States. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped revive the Italian economy which, until the 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the "Economic Miracle". In 1957, Italy was a founder member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

From the late 1960s till late 1980s the country experienced a hard economic crisis and the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterized by widespread social conflicts and terrorist acts carried out by extra-parliamentary movements. The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy, historical)|Christian Democrat]] leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978, bringing to an end the "[[Historic Compromise]]" between the DC and the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party]]. In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: a republican ([[Giovanni Spadolini]]) and a socialist ([[Bettino Craxi]]); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main force supporting the government. The [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PSI), led by [[Bettino Craxi]], became more and more critical of the Communists and of the [[Soviet Union]]; Craxi himself pushed in favour of US president [[Ronald Reagan]]'s positioning of [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing]] missiles in Italy, a move the Communists hotly contested.

[[File:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|right|The 1957 [[Treaties of Rome]] signing ceremony.]]

From 1992 to 1994, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters, disenchanted with past political paralysis, massive government debt and an extensive corruption system (collectively called [[Tangentopoli]] after being uncovered by the '[[Mani Pulite|Clean Hands]]' investigation ), demanded political, economic, and ethical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: between 1992 and 1994 the [[Christian Democracy (Italy, historical)|Christian Democrats]] underwent a severe crisis and was dissolved, splitting up into several pieces, while also the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] and the other governing minor parties also dissolved. The Communists reorganized as a [[social-democratic]] force.

The 1994 elections put media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]] into the Prime Minister's seat. However, he was forced to step down in December of that year when the ''[[Lega Nord]]'' Party withdrew its support. In April 1996, national elections led to the victory of a centre-left coalition under the leadership of [[Romano Prodi]]. Prodi's first government became the third-longest to stay in power before he narrowly lost a vote of confidence, by three votes, in October 1998. A new government was formed by [[Massimo D'Alema]], but in April 2000 he resigned.

In 2001, [[Italian general election, 2001|national elections]] led to the victory of a centre-right coalition under the leadership of [[Silvio Berlusconi]], who became prime minister once again. Berlusconi was able to remain in power for a complete five-year mandate, but with two different governments. The first one (2001–2005) became the longest-lived government in post-war Italy. Under that government, Italy joined the [[multinational coalition in Iraq|US-led military coalition in Iraq]]. The [[Italian general election, 2006|elections in 2006]] were won by the centre-left, allowing Prodi to form his second government, but in early 2008 he resigned after losing a confidence vote in Parliament. Mr. Berlusconi won the ensuing [[Italian general election, 2008|elections in April 2008]] to form a government for a third time.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Italy}}
[[File:Italy topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|250px|Topographic map of Italy]]

Italy is located in Southern Europe and comprises the boot-shaped [[Italian Peninsula]] and a number of islands including the two largest, [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]. It lies between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[48th parallel north|48° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].
Although the country occupies the Italian peninsula and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the [[Eurasia]]n continental shelf. These territories are the ''comuni'' of: [[Livigno]], [[Sexten]], [[Innichen]], [[Toblach]] (in part), [[Chiusaforte]], [[Tarvisio]], [[Graun im Vinschgau]] (in part), which are all part of the [[Danube#Drainage basin|Danube's drainage basin]], while the [[Val di Lei]] constitutes part of the [[Rhine]]'s basin and the island [[Lampedusa e Linosa|''comune'' of Lampedusa e Linosa]] is on the African [[continental shelf]].

The country's total area is 301,230&nbsp;km², of which 294,020&nbsp;km² is land and 7,210&nbsp;km² is water. Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of 7,600&nbsp;km on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]], [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas (740&nbsp;km), and borders shared with France (488&nbsp;km), Austria (430&nbsp;km), Slovenia (232&nbsp;km) and Switzerland; San Marino (39&nbsp;km) and Vatican City (3.2&nbsp;km), both enclaves, account for the remainder.

The [[Apennine Mountains]] form the peninsula's backbone and the [[Alps]] form its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on [[Mont Blanc]] (4,810 m/15,782&nbsp;ft). The [[Po river|Po]], Italy's longest river (652&nbsp;km/405&nbsp;mi), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the [[Padan plain]] on its way to the Adriatic Sea.
The five largest lakes are, in order of diminishing size:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.to.cnr.it/limnol/cicloac/lagit.htm|title=Morphometric and hydrological characteristics of some important Italian lakes|publisher=Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi|accessdate=3 March 2010|location=Largo Tonolli 50, 28922 Verbania Pallanza }}</ref> [[Lake Garda|Garda]] ({{convert|367.94|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}), [[Lake Maggiore|Maggiore]] ({{convert|212.51|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}), [[Lake Como|Como]] ({{convert|145.9|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}), [[Trasimeno Lake|Trasimeno]] ({{convert|124.29|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}) and [[Lake Bolsena|Bolsena]] ({{convert|113.55|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}).

The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable seismic and [[Volcanism in Italy|volcanic activity]]. There are [[List of volcanoes in Italy|14 volcanoes in Italy]], three of which are active: [[Etna]] (the traditional site of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]’s smithy), [[Stromboli]] and [[Vesuvius]]. Vesuvius is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculanum]]. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active [[caldera]], the [[Campi Flegrei]] north-west of Naples.

===Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Regions of Italy|Provinces of Italy|Municipalities of Italy}}

Italy is subdivided into 20 regions (''regioni'', singular ''regione''). Five of these regions have a [[autonomous regions with special statute|special autonomous status]] that enables them to enact legislation on some of their local matters; these are marked by an asterisk (*) in the table below. The country is further divided into 110 provinces (''province'') and 8,100 municipalities (''comuni'').

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Italy}}
The climate of Italy is highly diverse and can be far from the stereotypical [[Mediterranean climate]], depending on location. Most of the inland northern regions of Italy, for example [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]] and [[Emilia-Romagna]], have a   climate variously described as humid continental or temperate.  Adriana Rigutti (in Meteorologia, Giunti 2005) states that the climte of the “Po valley region [is] continental ... with harsh winters and hot summers”.<ref>Thomas A. Blair, Climatology: General and Regional, Prentice Hall pages 131–132; Adriana Rigutti, Meteorologia, Giunti, p, 95, 2009.</ref>  The coastal areas of [[Liguria]] and most of the peninsula south of [[Florence]] generally fit the Mediterranean stereotype ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer.

Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while due to rising water levels [[Venice]] has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the [[Seveso disaster]]. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and a [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|referendum on the issue]] the nuclear program was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008. A deal was signed with France in 2009 for the construction of up to four new nuclear plants. Deforestation, illegal building developments and poor land management policies have led to significant erosion all over Italy's mountainous regions, leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 [[Vajont Dam]] flood,  the 1998 [[Sarno]]<ref name="Sicily mudslide leaves scores dead">{{cite news|author=Nick Squires|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/6255575/Sicily-mudslide-leaves-scores-dead.html#|title=Sicily mudslide leaves scores dead|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=2 October 2009|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref> and 2009 [[2009 Messina floods and mudslides|Messina]] [[mudslide]]s.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Italy}}

[[File:Giorgio Napolitano-M.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Giorgio Napolitano]], 11th [[President of the Italian Republic]].]]

The politics of Italy take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary republic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|democratic]] republic, and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised collectively by the Council of Ministers, which is led by a [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), informally referred to as "premier" or ''primo ministro'' (that is, "prime minister"). [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two houses of [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]] primarily, and secondarily in the Council of Ministers. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislative. Italy has been a democratic republic since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by popular [[referendum]] (see "[[birth of the Italian Republic]]"). The [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]] was promulgated on 1 January 1948.

[[Giorgio Napolitano]] is the [[President of the Italian Republic]], whilst [[Silvio Berlusconi]] is the nation's Prime Minister (President of the Council of Ministers).

The [[President of the Italian Republic]] (''Presidente della Repubblica'') is elected for seven years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. As the [[head of state]], the President of the Republic represents the unity of the nation and has many of the duties previously given to the [[King of Italy]]. The president serves as a point of connection between the three branches of power: he is elected by the lawmakers, he appoints the executive, he is the president of the judiciary and he is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

[[File:Aula Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|205px|upright|[[Palazzo Montecitorio]], seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]].]]

The president nominates the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]], who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must obtain a confidence vote from both houses of Parliament. Legislative bills may originate in either house and must be passed by a majority in both.

Italy elects a [[Parliament of Italy|parliament]] consisting of [[bicameralism|two houses]], the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Camera dei Deputati''), which has 630 members and the [[Italian Senate|Senate of the Republic]] (''Senato della Repubblica''), comprising 315 elected members and a small number of [[senators for life]]). [[Legislation]] may originate in either house and must be passed in identical form by a majority in each. The houses of parliament are popularly and directly elected through a complex electoral system (latest amendment in 2005) which combines proportional representation with a majority prize for the largest coalition. All [[Italian Citizenship|Italian citizens]] 18 years of age and older can vote. However, to vote for the Senate, the voter must be 25 or older.

The electoral system for the [[Senate of Italy|Senate]] is based upon [[Regions of Italy|regional]] representation. As of 17 August 2010 there are six [[senator for life]] (of which two are former Presidents). Both houses are elected for a maximum of five years, but both may be dissolved by the President before the expiration of their normal term if the Parliament is unable to elect a stable government. In post-war history, this has happened in 1972, 1976, 1979, 1983, 1994, 1996, and 2008.

A peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad (about 2.7&nbsp;million people). Among the 630 Deputies and the 315 Senators there are respectively 12 and 6 elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]]. These members of Parliament were elected for the first time in April 2006, and they have the same powers as those of members elected in Italy.

===Law===
{{Main|Judiciary of Italy|Law enforcement in Italy}}
The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later statutes. The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] is the court of last resort for most disputes. The [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] (''Corte Costituzionale'') rules on the conformity of laws with the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]] and is a post-World War II innovation.

===Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Italy}}
[[File:S. Berlusconi-George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[George W. Bush]]: during the 2000s, Berlusconi and his cabinets have had a strong tendency to support American foreign policies.]]

Italy was a founding member of the European Community—now the European Union (EU). Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955 and is a member and strong supporter of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]] (GATT/WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Initiative]]. Its recent turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the [[Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (CSCE), the forerunner of the OSCE, in 1994; [[G8]]; and the EU in 2009 and from July to December 2003.

Italy supports the United Nations and its international security activities. Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor and provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania. Italy deployed over 2,000 troops to Afghanistan in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) in February 2003. Italy still supports international efforts to reconstruct and stabilize Iraq, but it has withdrawn its [[Multinational force in Iraq#Troop deployment in Iraq 2003-present|military contingent]] of some 3,200 troops as of November 2006, maintaining only humanitarian workers and other civilian personnel.
In August 2006 Italy sent about 2,450 soldiers to Lebanon for the United Nations' [[peacekeeping|peacekeeping mission]] [[UNIFIL]].<ref name="NewsMax" >"[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/08_Agosto/29/libano.shtml Italian soldiers leave for Lebanon] Corriere della Sera, 30 August 2006</ref>

The Italian Army is the national ground defense force, numbering 109,703 in 2008. Its best-known combat vehicles are the [[Dardo IFV|Dardo]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]], the [[Centauro]] [[tank destroyer]] and the [[Ariete]] [[tank]], and among its aircraft the [[Agusta A129 Mangusta|Mangusta]] [[attack helicopter]], recently deployed in UN missions. It  also has at its disposal a large number of [[Leopard 1]] and [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] armored vehicles.
   
 [[File:Eurofighter Typhoon 02.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] operated by the [[Italian Air Force]].]]

The Italian Navy in 2008 had 35,200 active personnel with 85 commissioned ships and 123 aircraft.<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.marina.difesa.it/ Italian Navy]</ref> It is now equipping itself with a bigger [[aircraft carrier]], (the ''[[Italian aircraft carrier Cavour (550)|Cavour]]''), new [[destroyer]]s, submarines and multipurpose [[frigate]]s. In modern times the Italian Navy, being a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations around the world.

The Italian Air Force in 2008 had a strength of 43,882 and operated 585 aircraft, including 219 combat jets and 114 helicopters. As a stopgap and as replacement for leased [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] ADV interceptors, the AMI has leased 30 [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]A Block 15 ADF and four F-16B Block 10 Fighting Falcons, with an option for more. The coming years also will see the introduction of 121 [[Eurofighter Typhoon|EF2000 Eurofighter Typhoons]], replacing the leased F-16 Fighting Falcons. Further updates are foreseen in the Tornado IDS/IDT and [[AMX International AMX|AMX]] fleets. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 22 [[C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J]]s and [[Aeritalia G.222]]s of which 12 are being replaced with the newly developed G.222 variant called the [[C-27J Spartan]].

An autonomous corps of the military, the [[Carabinieri]] are the [[gendarmerie]] and [[military police]] of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italy's other police forces]]. While the different branches of the Carabinieri report to separate ministries for each of their individual functions, the corps reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/GoverningBodies/|title=The Carabinieri Force is linked to the Ministry of Defence|publisher=Carabinieri|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Italy}}
[[File:Citylife 02.jpg|thumb|right|Rendering of the new Milan [[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]] business district, currently under construction.]]

Italy has a capitalist economy with high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and developed infrastructure. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], in 2008 Italy was the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|seventh-largest]] economy in the world and the fourth-largest in Europe. Italy is member of the [[Group of Eight]] (G8) industrialized nations, the European Union and the [[OECD]].

In the post-war period, Italy was transformed from a weak, agricultural based economy which had been severely affected by the consequences of World War II, into [[Italian economic miracle|one of the world's most industrialized nations]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.careersineurope.hobsons.com/country_italy.aspx |title=Hobsons Careers in Europe &#124; Country profiles |publisher=Careersineurope.hobsons.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> and a leading country in [[international trade|world trade and exports]]. In 1987, the Italian economy temporarily overtook the [[Economy of UK|British economy]], by GDP (nominal), an event known as '[[il sorpasso (economics)|''il sorpasso'']]'<ref>[http://faculty.darden.virginia.edu/eakerm/f-1245.pdf Italy: a difficult economy?], Graduate School of Business Administration, University of Virginia</ref> and in 1991 Italy became for a while the world's fourth-largest economic power. It may have briefly overtaken France as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1991/05/16/abbiamo-superato-anche-la-francia-secondo-business.html/ |title=Abbiamo Superato Anche La Francia Secondo Business International> |publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> This was due to a rapid increase in public expenditure in order to boost economic growth, which eventually resulted in unsustainable levels of public debt. In 1980 the public debt amounted to only 56.9 per cent  of the GDP. By 1994 it had reached the record level of 121.8% per cent of GDP. This was over twice the ceiling fixed by the Maastricht agreement and the highest level of indebtedness of any member country of the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=46&pr.y=10&sy=1980&ey=2014&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=132,112,134,136&s=GGD,GGD_NGDP&grp=0&a= |title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects |publisher=Imf.org |date=14 September 2006 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> The result since then has been very low levels of growth, even compared to other European countries. Between 2000 and 2007 it averaged 1.5%, against the 2.4% of the European Union as a whole.

Italy has a smaller number of world-class multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size, but there is a large number of [[small and medium-sized enterprises]], and in the Northern "industrial triangle" (Milan-Turin-Genoa) or the Tuscan industrial triangle (Florence-Prato-Pistoia), where there is an area of intense industrial and machinery production, notably in their several [[industrial district]]s, which were for long the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of [[niche market]] and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs with higher quality products.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21808326~menuPK:258604~pagePK:2865106~piPK:2865128~theSitePK:258599,00.html|title=Knowledge Economy Forum 2008: Innovative Small And Medium Enterprises Are Key To Europe & Central Asian Growth|publisher=The World Bank|date=19 May 2005|accessdate = 17 June 2008}}</ref>

In 2004 the transport sector in Italy generated a turnover of about 119.4&nbsp;billion euros, employing 935,700 persons in 153,700 enterprises. Regarding the national road network, in 2002 there were 668,721&nbsp;km (415,612&nbsp;mi) of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,487&nbsp;km (4,031&nbsp;mi) of motorways, state-owned but privately operated by [[Atlantia (company)|Atlantia]].

The national inland [[waterways]] network comprised 1,477&nbsp;km (918&nbsp;mi) of navigable rivers and channels in 2002. In 2004 there were approximately 30 main airports (including the two [[Airline hub|hubs]] of [[Malpensa International Airport|Malpensa International]] in Milan and [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport|Leonardo Da Vinci International]] in Rome) and 43 major seaports (including the seaport of [[Genoa]], the country's largest and second largest in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]).

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demography of Italy}}
[[File:Italy-demography2006est.png|thumb|right|Population 1960–2006. Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

With a population estimated in 60.4&nbsp;million, Italy has the fourth-largest population in the European Union and the 23rd-largest population worldwide. The population density, at over 200 persons per square kilometer (over 500/sq mi), is the fifth highest in the European Union. The highest density is in [[Northern Italy]], as that one-third of the country contains almost half of the total population.

After World War II, Italy enjoyed a prolonged economic boom which caused a major rural exodus to the cities, and at the same time transformed the nation from a massive emigration country to a net immigrant-receiving country. High fertility persisted until the 1970s, when it plunged below the replacement rates, so that as of 2008, one in five Italians was over 65 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF|title=Ageing characterises the demographic perspectives of the European societies – Issue number 72/2008|author=[[EUROSTAT]]|accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> Despite this, thanks mainly to the massive immigration of the last two decades, in the first decade of the 21st century, Italy experienced a growth in the crude birth rate (especially in the northern regions) for the first time in many years.<ref>{{it icon}} {{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_1.pdf|title=Crude birth rates, mortality rates and marriage rates 2005–2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=10 May 2009}}</ref> The [[total fertility rate]] has also significantly grown in the past few years, thanks to rising births among both in foreign-born and Italian women, as it climbed from an all-time minimum of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008.<ref>{{it icon}} {{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_4.pdf |title=Average number of children born per woman 2005–2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref>

As of 2009, the foreign born population origin of Italy was subdivided as follows: Europe (53.5%), Africa (22.3%), Asia (15.8%), the Americas (8.1%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign born population is largely uneven in Italy: 87.3% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 12.8% live in the southern half of the peninsula.

{{Main|Languages of Italy}}

[[File:Map Italophone World - updated.png|right|thumb|300px|"Italophone" world. Dark blue:official language; green: secondary, widely spoken or understood; light blue: understood by some due to former colonisation.]]

Italy's official language is Italian. [[Ethnologue]] has estimated that there are about 55&nbsp;million speakers of the language in Italy and a further 6.7&nbsp;million outside of the country.<ref name="ethnologue.com" >[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita Ethnologue report for language code:ita (Italy)] – Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version</ref> However, between 120 and 150&nbsp;million people use Italian as a second or cultural language, worldwide.<ref>[http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/Italian_language::sub::Geographic_Distribution Italian Language: Geographic Distribution] ''Discovery Media'.' Retrieved 16 May 2010.</ref>

Italian, adopted by the state after the [[unification of Italy]], is based on the [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] variety of [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and is somewhat intermediate between the [[Italo-Western|Italo-Dalmatian languages]] of the [[Mezzogiorno|South]] and the [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] [[Northern Italian languages]]. Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the [[Migration period|post-Roman invaders]].

Italy has numerous dialects spoken all over the country and some Italians cannot speak Italian language at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297241/Italian-language |title=Italian language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> However, the establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television (the state broadcaster [[RAI]] helped set a standard Italian).

Several ethnic groups are legally recognized,<ref>[L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, Statuto speciale per la Valle d'Aosta; L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 5, Statuto speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige; L.cost. 31 gennaio 1963, n. 1, Statuto speciale della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia]</ref> and a number of minority languages have co-official status alongside Italian in various parts of the country. French is co-official in the [[Valle d’Aosta]]—although in fact [[Franco-Provencal]] is more commonly spoken there. German has the same status in the [[Province of Bolzano-Bozen]] as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring [[Trentino]], does [[Ladin language|Ladin]]. [[Slovene language|Slovene]] is officially recognised in the provinces of [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]] in [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]].

In these regions official documents are bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities), or available upon request in either Italian or the co-official language. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d’Aosta where – with the exception of [[Aosta]] itself which has retained its Latin form in Italian (as in English) – French toponyms are generally used, attempts to [[Fascist Italianization|Italianise]] them during the Fascist period having been abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.

Roman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the [[state religion]]. The proportion of Italians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic is 87.8%,<ref>{{it icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/01_Gennaio/17/cattolici.shtml|title=Italy: 88% of Italians declare themselves Catholic|publisher=Corriere della Sera|date=18 January 2006|accessdate = 10 May 2009}}</ref> although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%).

Most Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |title=ReportDGResearchSocialValuesEN2.PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'.

;Christianity

The Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]], [[curia]] in Rome, and the [[Conference of Italian Bishops]]. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy]]. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with [[Latin]], Italian is the most spoken and second language of the [[Roman Curia]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1066140.stm|work=BBC News|title=Country profile: Vatican|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>

Italy has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic [[saint]]s, [[martyr]]s and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the [[Middle-Ages]], [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Giotto]]. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as [[St Peter's Basilica]], [[Florence Cathedral]] and [[St Mark's Basilica]]. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 87.8% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/countrynow.htm#Top |title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Living cardinals arranged by country |publisher=Fiu.edu |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.<ref name="kwintessential.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/italy-country-profile.html |title=Italy – Italian Language, Culture, Customs and Business Etiquette |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

Even though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of Protestant, [[Waldensian]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other Christian churches.

In the 20th century, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Pentecostalism]], non-denominational [[Evangelicalism]], and [[Mormonism]] were the fastest-growing Protestant churches. Immigration from [[Western Africa|Western]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and Eastern Africa at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of [[Baptist]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from Eastern Europe has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.

In 2006, Protestants made up 2.1% of Italy's population, and members of Eastern Orthodox churches comprised 1.2%. Other Christian groups in Italy include more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians including 180,000 [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ortodossia.it/The%20Holy%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20Italy%20ed%20Malta.htm |title=The Holy Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta |publisher=Ortodossia.it |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> 550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists (0.8%), of whom 400,000 are members of the [[Assemblies of God]], 235,685 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.4%),<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/t/testimoni_geova_02.htm Center for Studies on New Religions]</ref> 30,000 Waldensians,<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/storia/dove_viviamo.php Waldensian Evangelical Church]</ref> 25,000 [[Seventh-day Adventists]], 22,000 Mormons, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 [[Lutherans]], 4,000 [[Methodists]] (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/regions/europe/italy/evangelical-methodist-church-in-italy.html |title=World Council of Churches |publisher=Oikoumene.org |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref>

;Other religions
The longest-established religious faith in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in [[Ancient Rome]] before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as [[Luigi Luzzatti]], who took office in 1910, [[Ernesto Nathan]] served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and [[Shabbethai Donnolo]] (died 982). During the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Italy took in many Jewish refugees from [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet [[Italian Social Republic]], about 15% of Italy's Jews were killed, despite the Fascist government's refusal to deport Jews to Nazi death camps. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.

Due to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian faiths. In 2009, there were 1.0&nbsp;million [[Muslims]] in Italy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.0.3202304679 |title=Italy: Country's muslims raise funds to help quake victims – Adnkronos Religion |publisher=Adnkronos.com |date=7 April 2003 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> forming 1.6 percent of population although, only 50,000 hold [[Italian citizenship]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Italy}}
[[File:JvB2006-T DSCF5878.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Venice]], built on 117 islands.]]

Italy did not exist as a state until the country's unification in 1861. Due to this comparatively late unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the [[Italian Peninsula]], many traditions and customs that are now recognized as distinctly Italian can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social distinction of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense. Italy is home to the greatest number of [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Italy|World Heritage Sites]] (45) to date, and has rich collections of world art, culture and literature from many different periods. Italy has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other countries during the [[Italian diaspora]]. Italy has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains).<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2005, pg. 19">Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 19</ref>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Italy}}
[[File:Leaning tower of pisa 2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].]]

Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, due to Italy's division into several city-states until 1861. However, this has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs. Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements,<ref>[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp Architecture in Italy], ItalyTravel.com</ref> such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structure during [[ancient Rome]], the founding of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architectural movement]] in the late-14th to 16th century, and being the homeland of [[Palladianism]], a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of [[Neoclassical architecture]], and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late-17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the [[Colosseum]], the [[Milan Cathedral]] and [[Florence cathedral]], the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and the building designs of [[Venice]] are found in Italy. Italy has an estimated total of 100,000 monuments of all varieties (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains).<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2005, pg. 19"/>

Italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. [[Italianate architecture]], popular abroad from the 16th to mid-20th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style. British architect [[Inigo Jones]], inspired by the avant-garde designs of Italian buildings and cities, in the early-17th century, brought back these ideas with him to London, and ever since, this Italianate architecture has been popular in construction designs all over the world.

Over the centuries, Italian art has gone through many stylistic changes. Italian painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of [[Caravaggio]] and [[Titian]], and a preoccupation with religious figures and motifs. Italian painting enjoyed preeminence in Europe for hundreds of years, from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods, and through the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Italy. Notable artists who fall within these periods include [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Donatello]], [[Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Bernini]], [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]].

Thereafter, Italy was to experience a continual subjection to foreign powers which caused a shift of focus to political matters, leading to its decline as the artistic authority in Europe. Not until 20th century [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], would Italy recapture any of its former prestige as a seminal place of artistic evolution. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow.

===Literature and theatre===
{{Main|Literature of Italy}}
[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the famous incipit ''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'' in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence 1465.]]

The basis of the modern [[Italian language]] was established by the [[Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], whose greatest work, the [[Divine Comedy]], is considered amongst the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. There is no shortage of celebrated literary figures in Italy: [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Giacomo Leopardi]], [[Alessandro Manzoni]], [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and [[Francesco Petrarca|Petrarch]], whose best-known vehicle of expression, the [[sonnet]], was invented in Italy.

Prominent philosophers include [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Giambattista Vico]]. Modern literary figures and Nobel laureates are nationalist poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] in 1906, realist writer [[Grazia Deledda]] in 1926, modern theatre author [[Luigi Pirandello]] in 1936, poets [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] in 1959 and [[Eugenio Montale]] in 1975, satirist and theatre author [[Dario Fo]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/|title=All Nobel Laureates in Literature}}</ref>

Italian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition which was heavily influenced by the Greek; as with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists tended to adapt and translate from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''Phaedra'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the [[comedies]] of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]]. During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]], and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the [[symphony]], concerto, and [[sonata]], can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th and 17th century Italian music.

Modern Italian composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]] proved significant in the development of [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[electronic music]]. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as [[La Scala]] of Milan and [[Teatro di San Carlo|San Carlo]] of Naples, and performers such as the pianist [[Maurizio Pollini]] and the late tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.

[[La Scala]] operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous [[Italian opera]] singers include [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Alessandro Bonci]], the late [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and [[Andrea Bocelli]], to name a few.

Introduced in the early 1920s, [[jazz]] took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centers of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the [[progressive rock]] movement of the 1970s, with bands like [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]] and [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]. Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]]. Singers such as [[traditional pop|pop]] [[diva]] [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], classical crossover artist [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], and European chart-topper [[Eros Ramazzotti]] have attained international acclaim.

{{Main|Cinema of Italy}}

The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds long, showing [[Pope Leo XIII]] giving a blessing to the camera. The [[List of Italian films|Italian film]] industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the [[Società Italiana Cines]], the [[Ambrosio Film]] and the [[Itala Film]]. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by [[Benito Mussolini]], who founded Rome's renowned [[Cinecittà]] studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until the World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |title=The Cinema Under Mussolini |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref>

After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s. [[List of film directors from Italy|Notable Italian film directors]] from this period include [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Dario Argento]]. Movies include world cinema treasures such as ''[[La dolce vita]]'', ''[[Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo]]'' and ''[[Ladri di biciclette]]''.
In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ''[[La vita è bella]]'' directed by [[Roberto Benigni]] and ''[[Il postino]]'' with [[Massimo Troisi]].

===Science===

Through the centuries, Italy has given birth to some notable scientific minds. Amongst them, and perhaps the most famous polymath in history, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made several contributions to a variety of fields including art, biology, and technology. [[Galileo Galilei]] was a [[physicist]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]] who played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and support for [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]]. The physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], a Nobel prize laureate, was the leader of the team that built the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

A brief overview of some other notable figures includes the astronomer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], who made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]; the physicist [[Alessandro Volta]], inventor of the [[battery (electricity)|electric battery]]; the mathematicians [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Fibonacci]], and [[Gerolamo Cardano]], whose [[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]] is generally recognized as the first modern treatment on mathematics, made fundamental advances to the field; [[Marcello Malpighi]], a doctor and founder of [[microscopic anatomy]]; the biologist [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who conducted important research in bodily functions, animal reproduction, and cellular theory; the physician, pathologist, scientist, and Nobel laureate [[Camillo Golgi]], whose many achievements include the discovery of the [[Golgi complex]], and his role in paving the way to the acceptance of the [[Neuron doctrine]]; and [[Guglielmo Marconi]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the [[invention of radio]].

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Italy}}

Italy has a long sporting tradition. In numerous sports, both individual and team, Italy has good representation and many successes. The most popular sport is by far [[Association football|football]]. Basketball and volleyball are the next most popular/played, with Italy having a rich tradition in both. Italy won the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and is currently the second most successful football team in the world, after Brazil, having won four [[FIFA World Cup]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/index.html |title=Previous FIFA World Cups™ |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> Italy has also got strong traditions in [[cycling]], tennis, [[track and field athletics|athletics]], [[fencing]], [[winter sport]]s and [[Rugby football|rugby]]. Italian [[Scuderia Ferrari]] is the oldest surviving team in [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] racing, having competed since 1948, and statistically the most successful [[Formula One]] team in history with a record of 15 drivers' championships. As a constructor, Ferrari has 16 constructors' championships.

===Fashion and design===

[[File:Valentino wedding dress.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A Wedding dress by [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]].]]

Italian fashion has a [[History of Italian fashion|a long tradition]], and is regarded as one of the most important in the world, along with [[French fashion]], American fashion, British fashion and Japanese fashion. Milan, Florence and Rome are Italy's main [[fashion capital]]s, however Naples, Turin, Venice, Bologna, Genoa and [[Vicenza]] are other major centres. According to the 2009 [[Global Language Monitor]], Milan was nominated the true fashion capital of the world, even surpassing other international cities, such as New York, Paris, London and Tokyo, and Rome came 4th.<ref name="languagemonitor.com" >{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor » Fashion |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> Major Italian fashion labels, such as [[Gucci]], [[Prada]], [[Versace]], [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Armani]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Missoni]], [[Fendi]], [[Moschino]], [[Max Mara]] and [[Ferragamo]], to name a few, are regarded as amongst the finest fashion houses in the world. Also, the fashion magazine [[Vogue Italia]], is considered the most important and prestigious fashion magazine in the world.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=pkeaOOxb_isC&pg=PA16&sig=JJmC6YC-Hmmm6Z5P2Cfbvz_jrSA#v=onepage&q=&f=false</ref>

Italy is also prominent in the field of [[design]], notably interior design, [[architectural design]], [[industrial design]] and [[urban design]]. Italy has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as [[Gio Ponti]] and [[Ettore Sottsass]], and Italian phrases such as ''"Bel Disegno"'' and ''"Linea Italiana"'' have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.<ref>Miller (2005) p.486</ref> Examples of classic pieces of Italian [[white goods]] and pieces of furniture include [[Zanussi]]'s [[washing machine]]s and [[fridge]]s,<ref name="Insight Guides 2004 p.220">Insight Guides (2004) p.220</ref> the "New Tone" sofas by Atrium,<ref name="Insight Guides 2004 p.220"/> and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by [[Bob Dylan]]'s song ''[[Memphis Blues]]''.<ref name="Insight Guides 2004 p.220"/> Today, [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] are the nation's leaders in [[architectural design]] and [[industrial design]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Italian cuisine}}
Modern Italian [[cuisine]] has evolved through centuries of social and political changes, with its roots reaching back to the 4th century BC. Significant change occurred with the discovery of the [[New World]], when vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, [[bell pepper]]s, and maize became available. However, these central ingredients of modern Italian cuisine were not introduced in scale before the 18th century.<ref>Del Conte, 11–21.</ref>

Ingredients and dishes vary by region. However, many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. Cheese and wine are major parts of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (regulated appellation) laws. Coffee, and more specifically [[espresso]], has become highly important to the cultural cuisine of Italy. Some famous dishes and items include [[pasta]], [[pizza]], ''[[lasagna]]'', ''[[focaccia]]'', and ''[[gelato]]''.

# According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37.2% of 2.8&nbsp;million immigrants in that country<ref>Mitrica, Mihai [http://web.archive.org/web/20071023072029/http://evz.ro/article.php?artid=201813 Un milion de romani s-au mutat in Italia] ("One million Romanians have moved to Italy"). ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 31 October 2005. Visited 11 April 2006.</ref> but it is unclear how the estimate was made, and therefore whether it should be taken seriously.

#Official French maps show the border detouring south of the main summit, and claim the highest point in Italy is Mont Blanc de Courmayeur (4,748&nbsp;m), but these are inconsistent with an 1861 convention and topographic watershed analysis.
