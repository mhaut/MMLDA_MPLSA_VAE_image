'''Watermelon''' (''Citrullus lanatus'' ([[Carl Peter Thunberg|Thunb.]]), family [[Cucurbitaceae]]) can be both the [[fruit]] and the [[plant]] of a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) plant originally from southern [[Africa]], and is one of the most common types of [[melon]]. This [[flowering plant]] produces a special type of fruit known by [[botany|botanists]] as a [[Epigynous berry|pepo]], a berry which has a thick [[Peel (fruit)|rind]] ([[Pericarp|exocarp]]) and fleshy center (mesocarp and endocarp); pepos are derived from an inferior ovary, and are characteristic of the Cucurbitaceae. The watermelon fruit, loosely considered a type of [[melon]] (although not in the genus ''[[Cucumis]]''), has a smooth exterior rind (green, yellow and sometimes white) and a juicy, sweet interior flesh (usually pink, but sometimes orange, yellow, red and sometimes green if not ripe). It is also commonly used to make a variety of salads, most notably fruit salad. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantdex.com/index.php/species-growing-guides/watermelon|title=Watermelon |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref>


==History==
[[File:Single Watermelon Leaf 2000px.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A close-up of a watermelon leaf]]
Watermelon is thought to have originated in southern Africa, where it is found growing wild, because it reaches maximum [[genetic diversity]] there, resulting in sweet, bland and bitter forms. [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]], in 1882,<ref>Candolle, ''Origin of Cultivated Plants'' (1882) pp 262ff, ''s.v.'' "Water-melon".</ref> already considered the evidence sufficient to prove that watermelon was indigenous to tropical Africa.<ref>[http://cuke.hort.ncsu.edu/cucurbit/wmelon/wmhndbk/wmbiogeography.html North Carolina State University: Watermelon biogeography].</ref> Though ''[[Colocynth|Citrullus colocynthis]]'' is often considered to be a wild ancestor of watermelon and is now found native in north and west Africa, Fenny Dane and Jiarong Liu<ref>Dane and Liu,, "Diversity and origin of cultivated and citron type watermelon (''Citrullus lanatus'')" ''Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution'' '''54'''.6 (September 2007).</ref> suggest on the basis of chloroplast DNA investigations that the cultivated and wild watermelon appear to have diverged independently from a common ancestor, possibly ''C. ecirrhosus'' from Namibia.

It is not known when the plant was first cultivated, but Zohary and Hopf note evidence of its cultivation in the [[Nile Valley]] from at least as early as the [[second millennium BC]]. Although watermelon is not depicted in any Egyptian hieroglyphic text nor does any ancient writer mention it, finds of the characteristically large seed are reported in [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth dynasty]] sites; numerous watermelon seeds were recovered from the tomb of [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].<ref>Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'', third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 193.</ref>

By the 10th century AD, watermelons were being cultivated in [[China]], which is today the world's single largest watermelon producer. By the 13th century, [[Moors|Moorish]] invaders had introduced the [[fruit]] to Europe; according to John Mariani's ''The Dictionary of American Food and Drink'', "watermelon" made its first appearance in an English dictionary in 1615.

''Museums Online South Africa'' list watermelons as having been introduced to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the 16th century. Early French explorers found Native Americans cultivating the fruit in the [[Mississippi Valley]]. Many sources list the watermelon as being introduced in [[Massachusetts]] as early as 1629. [[Southern United States|Southern]] food historian John Egerton has said he believes African [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] helped introduce the watermelon to the [[United States]]. Texas Agricultural Extension horticulturalist Jerry Parsons lists African slaves and European colonists as having distributed watermelons to many areas of the world. Parsons also mentions the crop being farmed by Native Americans in [[Florida]] (by 1664) and the [[Colorado River]] area (by 1799). Other early watermelon sightings include the [[US Midwest|Midwestern states]] (1673), [[Connecticut]] (1747) and the [[Illiana]] region (1822).
[[File:Watermelons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watermelons on display by a roadside vendor in [[Delhi]], [[India]]]]
Charles Fredric Andrus, a horticulturist at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Vegetable Breeding Laboratory in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], set out to produce a disease-resistant and wilt-resistant watermelon. The result was "that gray melon from Charleston." Its oblong shape and hard rind made it easy to stack and ship. Its adaptability meant it could be grown over a wide geographical area. It produced high yields and was resistant to the most serious watermelon diseases: [[anthracnose]] and [[fusarium wilt]].

Today, farmers in approximately 44 states in the U.S. grow watermelon commercially, and almost all these varieties have some ''Charleston Gray'' in their lineage. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Texas]], [[California]] and [[Arizona]] are the USA's largest watermelon producers.

This now-common watermelon is often large enough that groceries often sell half or quarter melons. There are also some smaller, spherical varieties of watermelon, both red- and yellow-fleshed, sometimes called "icebox melons."
[[File:Square watermelon.jpg|thumb|right|Square watermelon from Japan]]
In [[Japan]], farmers of the [[Zentsuji]] region found a way to grow cubic watermelons, by growing the fruits in glass boxes and letting them naturally assume the shape of the receptacle.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1390088.stm (BBC) Square fruit stuns Japanese shoppers] BBC News Friday, 15 June 2001, 10:54 GMT 11:54 UK</ref> The square shape is designed to make the melons easier to stack and store, but the square watermelons are often more than double the price of normal ones. Pyramid shaped watermelons have also been developed and any polyhedral shape may potentially also be used.

==Culture==
For commercial plantings, one [[beehive]] per acre (4,000 m² per hive) is the minimum recommendation by the US Department of Agriculture for [[pollination]] of conventional, seeded varieties. Because seedless hybrids have sterile pollen, [[pollinizer]] rows of varieties with viable pollen must also be planted. Since the supply of viable pollen is reduced and pollination is much more critical in producing the seedless variety, the recommended number of hives per acre, or [[pollinator]] density, increases to three hives per acre (1,300 m² per hive).

A watermelon contains about 6% sugar and 92% [[water]] by weight.<ref>[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn010806.html Seven wonders of watermelon<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> As with many other fruits, it is a source of [[vitamin C]].

Notable is the inner rind of the watermelon, which is usually a light green or white color. This area is edible and contains many hidden nutrients that most people avoid eating due to its unappealing flavor.

The amino acid [[citrulline]] was first extracted from watermelon and analysed.<ref>{{cite journal

Pickled watermelon rind is also commonly consumed in the [[Southern US]].<ref>[http://southernfood.about.com/od/picklesrelishes/r/blbb474.htm Southern U.S. Cuisine: Judy's Pickled Watermelon Rind]</ref> Watermelon juice can also be made into [[wine]].<ref>[http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/watermel.aspInsert footnote text here]</ref>

Watermelon is also mildly [[diuretic]].<ref>{{cite news|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/07/03/science-watermelon.html |title=CBC News - Health - Watermelon the real passion fruit? |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref>
