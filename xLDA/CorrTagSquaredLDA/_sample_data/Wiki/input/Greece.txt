Situated on the southern end of the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]], Greece has land borders with [[Albania]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the east. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of mainland Greece, the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south.  Greece has the [[list of countries by length of coastline|tenth longest coastline]] in the world at {{convert|14880|km|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} in length, featuring a vast number of [[List of islands of Greece|islands]] (approximately 1400, of which 227 are inhabited), including [[Crete]], the [[Dodecanese]], the [[Cyclades]], and the [[Ionian Islands]] among others. Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains, of which [[Mount Olympus]] is the highest at {{convert|2917|m|0|abbr=on|lk=out}}.

Modern Greece traces its roots to the civilisation of [[ancient Greece]], generally considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. As such, it is the birthplace of [[democracy]],<ref>Finley, M. I. Democracy Ancient and Modern. 2d ed., 1985.

This legacy is partly reflected in the 17 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Greece (17)|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] located in Greece.  The modern Greek state was established in 1830, following a [[Greek War of Independence|victorious uprising]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]].

[[File:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Alexander Mosaic]], depicting [[Alexander the Great]] on his horse [[Bucephalus]].]]

Greece was the first area in [[Europe]] where advanced early civilizations emerged, beginning with the [[Cycladic civilization]] of the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Minoan civilization]] in [[Crete]] and then the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilization on the mainland. Later, [[city-state]]s emerged across the Greek peninsula and spread to the shores of the [[Black Sea]], [[Magna Grecia|South Italy]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], reaching great levels of [[wealth|prosperity]] that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of [[classical Greece]], expressed in [[Architecture of ancient Greece|architecture]], [[Theatre of ancient Greece|drama]], [[science]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]], and nurtured in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] under a [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] environment.

Athens and [[Sparta]] led the way in repelling the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in a series of [[Greco-Persian Wars|battles]]. Both were later overshadowed by [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and eventually [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], with the latter under the guidance of [[Alexander the Great]] uniting and leading the Greek world to victory over the Persians.

The [[Hellenistic period]] was brought only partially to a close two centuries later with the establishment of [[Roman Greece|Roman rule]] over Greek lands in 146&nbsp;BC.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6930285.stm Alexander's Gulf outpost uncovered]. ''BBC News.'' 7 August 2007.</ref> Many Greeks migrated to [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Seleucia]] and the many other new Hellenistic cities in [[Seleucid Empire|Asia]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Africa]] founded in Alexander's wake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf|title=Growth of the Greek Colonies in the First Millenium BC (application/pdf Object)|publisher=www.princeton.edu|accessdate=2 January 2009|last=|first=}}</ref>

The subsequent mixture of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Hellenic cultures took form in the establishment of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 330&nbsp;AD around [[Constantinople]]. Byzantium remained a major cultural and military power for the next 1,123 years, until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. On the [[Byzantine–Ottoman Wars|eve]] of the Ottoman conquest, much of the Greek intelligentsia migrated to [[Italy]] and other parts of Europe not under Ottoman rule, playing a significant role in the [[Renaissance]] through the transmission of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] works to [[Western Europe]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displaystory.cfm?story_id=346800 |title=Millennium issue: Trouble with Turkey The fall of Constantinople Economist.com |work=The Economist  |date=20 March 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman millet]] system contributed to the cohesion of the Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the empire based on religion, as the latter played an integral role in the formation of modern Greek identity.

After the [[Greek War of Independence]], successfully waged against the Ottoman Empire from 1821 to 1829, the [[First Hellenic Republic|nascent Greek state]] was finally recognized under the [[London Protocol]] in 1830. In 1827, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], from [[Corfu]], was chosen as the first governor of the new Republic. However, following his assassination, the [[Great Power]]s installed a [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] under [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], of the Bavarian [[House of Wittelsbach]]. In 1843, an uprising forced the King to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.

Due to his unimpaired authoritarian rule, he was eventually dethroned in 1863 and replaced by Prince Vilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name [[George I of Greece|George I]] and brought with him the [[Ionian Islands]] as a coronation gift from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1877, [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], who is attributed with the significant improvement of the country's infrastructure, curbed the power of the monarchy to interfere in the assembly by issuing the rule of [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] to any potential [[prime minister]].

===20th century===
As a result of the [[Balkan Wars]], Greece increased the extent of its territory and population. In the following years, the struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over the country's foreign policy on the eve of [[World War I]] dominated the country's political scene, and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]].

In the aftermath of WWI, Greece [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|fought]] against Turkish nationalists led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], a war which resulted in a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|massive population exchange between the two countries]] under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,451140,00.html The Diaspora Welcomes the Pope].

[[File:Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|190px|Territorial evolution of [[Kingdom of Greece]] until 1947.]]

On 28 October 1940 Fascist [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] demanded the surrender of Greece, but Greek dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]] refused and in the following [[Greco-Italian War]], Greece repelled Italian forces into [[Albania]], giving the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] their first victory over [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces on land. The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched German forces during the [[Battle of Greece]]. The German occupiers nevertheless met serious challenges from the [[Greek Resistance]]. Over 100,000 civilians died from starvation during the winter of 1941–42. In 1943 virtually the entire [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jewish]] population was deported to Nazi extermination camps.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244154/Greece/26430/Greek-history-since-World-War-I Greece]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref>

After liberation, Greece experienced a bitter [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] between [[communism|communist]] and [[anticommunist]] forces, which led to economic devastation and severe social tensions between [[right-wing politics|rightists]] and largely communist [[left-wing politics|leftists]] for the next 30 years.<ref>Mazower, Mark. ''After the War was Over''</ref> The next 20 years were characterized by marginalisation of the left in the political and social spheres but also by [[Greek economic miracle|rapid economic growth]], propelled in part by the [[Marshall Plan]].

King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine]]'s [[Apostasia of 1965|dismissal]] of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]]'s centrist government in  July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence which culminated in a coup d'état on 21 April 1967 by the [[United States]]-backed [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Regime of the Colonels]]. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on 17 November 1973 sent shockwaves through the regime, and a counter-coup established [[Brigadier]] [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as dictator. On 20 July 1974, as [[Turkey]] [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded]] the island of [[Cyprus]], the regime collapsed.

Former premier [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] was invited back from [[Paris]] where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the [[Metapolitefsi]] era. On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of [[NATO]] in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.<ref name="autogenerated2">History, Editorial Consultant: Adam Hart-Davis, Dorling Kindersley Limited publisher, ISBN 978-1-85613-062-2</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/70-79/1974e.htm |title=[[NATO]] Update 1974 |publisher=Nato.int |date=26 October 2001 |accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> The first multiparty [[Greek legislative election, 1974|elections]] since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which abolished the monarchy.

Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]] founded the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations alternating in government ever since. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> Traditionally strained [[Greek–Turkish relations|relations]] with neighbouring Turkey [[Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy|improved]] when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey's [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|bid]] for EU membership.

Greece became the tenth member of the [[European Communities]] (subsequently subsumed by the [[European Union]]) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of remarkable and sustained economic growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping and a fast-growing service sector have raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. The country adopted the [[euro]] in 2001 and successfully hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]]. More recently, it has borne the brunt of the [[late-2000s recession]] and related [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis]].

Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the [[Balkans]], the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] peninsula (separated from the mainland by the [[Corinth Canal|canal]] of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]), and [[Greek islands|numerous islands]] (1400, 227 of which are inhabited), including [[Crete]], [[Euboea]], [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], the [[Dodecanese]] and the [[Cyclades|Cycladic]] groups of the [[Aegean Sea]] as well as the [[Ionian Sea]] islands. Greece has the [[List of countries by length of coastline|tenth longest coastline]] in the world with {{convert|14880|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; its land boundary is {{convert|1160|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

It lies between latitudes [[34th parallel north|34°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian east|19°]] and [[30th meridian east|30° E]].

Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe.  [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]], a focal point of Greek culture throughout history culminates at Mytikas peak {{convert|2917|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the highest in the country. Once considered the throne of the Gods, it is today extremely popular among hikers and climbers. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the [[Pindus]] mountain range. The Pindus reaches a maximum elevation of {{convert|2637|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at Mt. Smolikas and is essentially a prolongation of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vikos-Aoos Gorge is yet another spectacular formation and a popular hotspot for those fond of extreme sports.

[[File:Ναυάγιο Ζακύνθου.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Navagio]] ([[MV Panagiotis|shipwreck]]) bay, in [[Zakynthos]].]]

The range continues through the central [[Peloponnese]], crosses the islands of [[Kythera]] and Antikythera and find its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of [[Crete]] where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. Most notably, the impressive [[Meteora]] formation consisting of high, steep boulders provides a breathtaking experience for the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the area each year.

Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the Rhodope range, spreading across the periphery of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests. The famous Dadia forest is in the prefecture of [[Evros Prefecture|Evros]], in the far northeast of the country.

[[File:Olympus-fromOlympicbeach.jpg|right|250px|thumb|View of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]], located on the border between [[Thessaly]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].]]

Expansive plains are primarily located in the prefectures of [[Thessaly]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country.  Rare marine species such as the Pinniped Seals and the [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]] live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered [[brown bear]], the [[lynx]], the [[Roe Deer]] and the Wild Goat.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greece belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]], [[Balkan mixed forests]], Rodope montane mixed forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and Crete Mediterranean forests.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Greece}}
[[File:Greece topo.jpg|thumb|right|Topographical map of Greece.]]

The climate of Greece can be categorised into three types (the Mediterranean, the Alpine and the Temperate) that influence well-defined regions of its territory. The Pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country by making the western side of it (areas prone to the south-westerlies) wetter on average than the areas lying to the east of it ([[lee side]] of the mountains). The Mediterranean type of climate features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The [[Cyclades]], the [[Dodecanese]], [[Crete]], the Eastern [[Peloponnese]] and parts of the [[Sterea Ellada]] (Central Continental Grece) region are mostly affected by this particular type of climate. Temperatures rarely reach extreme values along the coasts, although, with Greece being a highly mountainous country, snowfalls occur frequently in winter. It sometimes snows even in the [[Cyclades]] or the [[Dodecanese]].

The Alpine type is dominant mainly in the mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece (parts of [[Epirus (periphery)|Epirus]], [[Central Greece]], [[Thessaly]], [[Western Macedonia]]) as well as in the central parts of [[Peloponnese]], including parts of the prefectures of [[Achaia]], [[Arcadia]] and [[Laconia]], where extensions of the Pindus mountain range pass by. Finally, the Temperate type affects [[Central Macedonia]] and [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; it features cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms. Athens is located in a transitional area featuring both the Mediterranean and the Temperate types. The city's northern suburbs are dominated by the temperate type while the downtown area and the southern suburbs enjoy a typical Mediterranean type.

It has been revised twice since, in 1986 and in [[Greek Constitutional amendment of 2001|2001]]. The Constitution, which consists of 120 articles, provides for a [[separation of powers]] into [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch]]es, and grants extensive specific guarantees (further reinforced in 2001) of [[civil liberties]] and [[social rights]].<ref>P.D.

The [[Judicial system of Greece|Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] (Άρειος Πάγος), the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] (Συμβούλιο της Επικρατείας) and the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Court of Auditors]] (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο). The Judiciary system is also composed of civil courts, which judge civil and penal cases and administrative courts, which judge disputes between the citizens and the Greek administrative authorities.

===Political parties===
{{Main|Political parties of Greece}}

Since the restoration of democracy, the Greek [[two-party system]] is dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) and the social-democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK).<ref>For a diachronic analysis of the Greek party system see T. Pappas, ''Transformation of the Greek Party System Since 1951'', 90-114, who distinguishes three distinct types of party system which developed in consecutive order, namely, a predominant-party system (from 1952 to 1963), a system of polarised pluralism (between 1963 and 1981), and a two-party system (since 1981).</ref> Other significant parties include the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) and the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] (LAOS). The current prime minister is [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], president of the PASOK, who on [[Greek legislative election, 2009|4 October 2009]], won with a majority in the Parliament of 160 out of 300 seats.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greece (2011)}}
Since the [[Kallikratis programme]] reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen [[Peripheries of Greece|peripheries]] subdivided into a total of 325 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]]. The 54 old [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures and prefecture-level administrations]] have been largely retained as sub-units of the peripheries. Seven decentralized administrations group one to three peripheries for administrative purposes on a regional basis. There is also one [[autonomous area]], [[Mount Athos]] ({{lang-el|Agio Oros}}, "Holy Mountain"), which borders the periphery of [[Central Macedonia]].

The Hellenic Armed Forces are overseen by the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] (Γενικό Επιτελείο Εθνικής Άμυνας – ΓΕΕΘΑ) and consists of three branches:
* [[Hellenic Army]]
* [[Hellenic Navy]]
* [[Hellenic Air Force]]

The civilian authority for the Greek military is the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]]. Furthermore, Greece maintains the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] for law enforcement in the sea and for search and rescue.

Greece currently has [[Conscription in Greece|universal compulsory military service]] for males, while females (who may serve in the military) are exempted from conscription. As of 2009, Greece has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a complete professional army system, the government had promised that the mandatory military service would be cut or even abolished completely.

Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. Service in the Guard is paid. As a member of [[NATO]], the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance.

[[File:Salonica-view-aerial2.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the central districts of [[Thessaloniki]], Greece's second largest city and a major economic and industrial centre.]]

The Greek economy (that is gross domestic product, GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of 4% from 2004-2007 and 2% during 2008 (at constant prices of 2000), one of the highest rates in the Eurozone. However, in 2009 GDP decreased by -1.9%. In 2010 a decrease of GDP by -2.5% to -4% is estimated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investingreece.gov.gr/default.asp?pid=16&la=1|title=Greek Economy |publisher=investingreece.gov.gr |date= |accessdate=2010-30-12}}</ref> See below: [[Greece#2010 Economic Crisis|2010 Economic Crisis]].

[[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|left|Greece introduced the euro in 2002.]]

In Greece, the euro was introduced in 2002. As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001, however all Greek euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike some other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin. Eight different designs, one per face value, was selected for the Greek coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Greece changed the common side of their coins. Before adopting the Euro in 2002 Greece had maintained use of the [[Greek drachma]] from 1832.

Greece has one of the richest collections of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 200 euro, mainly issued to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €10 Greek commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

By the end of 2009, as a result of a combination of international and local factors (respectively, the world financial crisis and uncontrolled government spending), the Greek economy faced its [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis|most severe crisis]] since 1974 as the Greek government revised its deficit from an estimated 6% to 12.7% of gross domestic product (GDP).<ref>Matthew Lynn, ''Bust: Greece, the Euro and the Sovereign Debt Crisis'' (2010)</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last =  | first =  | title = Greece's sovereign-debt crunch: A very European crisis | The Economist | url = http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15452594 | publisher=| date =  4 February 2010| accessdate = 2 May 2010 }}</ref> In early 2010 it was revealed that successive Greek governments had been found to have consistently and deliberately misreported the country's official economic statistics to keep within the [[Euro convergence criteria|monetary union guidelines]].<ref>{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = EU Stats Office: Greek Economy Figures Unreliable&amp;nbsp;– ABC News | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9541636 | publisher=| date =  | accessdate = 2 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = Rehn: No other state will need a bail-out&amp;nbsp;– EU Observer | url = http://euobserver.com/19/30015 | publisher=| date =  | accessdate = 6 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = Greece Paid Goldman {{Nowrap|$300 Million}} To Help It Hide Its Ballooning Debts&amp;nbsp;– Business Insider | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-greece-paid-goldman-300-million-to-help-it-hide-its-ballooning-debts-2010-2 | publisher=| date =  | accessdate = 6 May 2010 }}</ref> This had enabled Greek governments to spend beyond their means, while hiding the actual deficit from the EU overseers.<ref>{{Cite news| last =  | first =  | title = Wall St. Helped to Mask Debt Fueling Europe's Crisis |work=The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/business/global/14debt.html?pagewanted=1&hp | publisher=| date =  14 February 2010| accessdate = 6 May 2010 | first1=Louise | last1=Story | first2=Landon | last2=Thomas Jr | first3=Nelson D. | last3=Schwartz}}</ref> In May 2010, the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6%<ref>{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = Greek Deficit Revised to 13.6%; Moody's Cuts Rating (Update2)&amp;nbsp;– Bloomberg.com | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&sid=aUi3XLUwIIVA | publisher=| date =  | accessdate = 2 May 2010 }}

As a consequence, there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece's ability to repay its sovereign debt.

An important percentage of Greece's income comes from tourism. In 2004 Greece welcomed 16.5&nbsp;million tourists.

Since the 1980s, the roads and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernized. Important works include the [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia Odos]] that connects north west Greece ([[Igoumenitsa]]) with northern and north east Greece ([[Kipoi, Evros|Kipoi]]). The [[Rio–Antirrio bridge]] (the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe) (2250&nbsp;m or 7382&nbsp;ft long) connects the western [[Peloponnese]] from [[Rio, Greece|Rio]] (7&nbsp;km or 4&nbsp;mi from [[Patras]]) with [[Antirrio]] in [[Central Greece]].

[[File:BrugPatras.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Rio-Antirio bridge]] near the city of [[Patras]] is the longest [[cable-stayed bridge]] in Europe and second in the world.]]
An expansion of the Patras-Athens national motorway towards [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]] in the western Peloponnese is scheduled to be completed by 2014. Most of the highway connection of Athens to Thessaloniki has also been upgraded.

The Athens metropolitan area has an [[Athens International Airport|international airport]], the privately run suburban motorway [[Attiki Odos]] and an expanded [[Athens Metro|metro system]]. Most of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connecting by air mainly from the two major airlines of Greece, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]]. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]]. Railway connections play a somewhat lesser role than in many other European countries, but railways too have been expanded, with new suburban connections around Athens, a modern intercity connection between Athens and Thessaloniki, and upgrading to double lines in many parts of the 2500&nbsp;km (1550&nbsp;mi) network. International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the [[Balkans]] and [[Turkey]].

===Communications===

Broadband internet availability is widespread in Greece; there were a total of 2.105.076 broadband connections as of early 2010. This translates to 18.6% broadband penetration.<ref name="cnbc">{{Cite news|url=http://www.adslgr.com/forum/showthread.php?t=431545 |title=? |language=Greek |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> [[Internet cafes]] that provide net access, office applications and multiplayer gaming are also a common sight in the country, while mobile internet on [[3G]] cellphone networks and public wi-fi hotspots are existent, but not as extensive.

===Science and technology===

[[File:NOESIS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]].]]

Because of its strategic location, qualified workforce and political and economic stability, many multinational companies such as [[Ericsson]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Motorola]] and [[Coca-Cola]] have their regional R&D Headquarters in Greece.

The [http://www.gsrt.gr/default.asp?V_LANG_ID=2, General Secretariat for Research and Technology] of the [http://www.ypan.gr/index_uk_c_cms.htm Hellenic Ministry of Development] is responsible for designing, implementing and supervising national research and technological policy.

In 2003, public spending on R&D was 456.37&nbsp;million euros (12.6% increase from 2002). Total research and development (R&D) spending (both public and private) as a percentage of GDP has increased considerably since the beginning of the past decade, from 0.38% in 1989, to 0.65% in 2001. R&D spending in Greece remains lower than the EU average of 1.93%, but, according to Research DC, based on OECD and Eurostat data, between 1990 and 1998, total R&D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third highest increase in Europe, after Finland and Ireland.

Greece's technology parks with incubator facilities include [http://www.stepc.gr/ the Science and Technology Park of Crete] (Heraklion), the [http://www.thestep.gr/ Thessaloniki Technology Park], the [http://www.ltp.ntua.gr/ Lavrio Technology Park] and the [http://www.psp.org.gr/apps/en/spag/ Patras Science Park]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}.Greece has been a member of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) since 2005.<ref name = ESA/> Cooperation between ESA and the Hellenic National Space Committee began in the early 1990s. In 1994, Greece and ESA signed their first cooperation agreement. Having formally applied for full membership in 2003, Greece became ESA's sixteenth member on 16 March 2005. As member of the ESA, Greece participates in the agency's telecommunication and technology activities, and the [[Global Monitoring for Environment and Security]] Initiative.

The birth rate in 2003 stood 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (14.5 per 1,000 in 1981). At the same time the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003. In 2001, 16.71% of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12% between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18% were 14 years old and younger.<ref name=nssg/>

Greek society has also rapidly changed with the passage of time. Marriage rates kept falling from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004.<ref name=nssg/> Divorce rates on the other hand, have seen an increase – from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.<ref name=nssg/> Almost two-thirds of the [[Greeks|Greek people]] live in urban areas.

Throughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks migrated to the [[Greek American|United States]], [[Greek Britons|United Kingdom]], [[Greek Australian|Australia]], [[Greek Canadians|Canada]], and [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]], creating a thriving [[Greek diaspora]]. The migration trend however has now been reversed after the important improvements of the Greek economy since the 80's.

===Immigration===
{{Main|Immigration to Greece|Minorities in Greece}}

Due to the complexity of Greek immigration policy, practices and data collection, truly reliable data on [[Immigration to Greece|immigrant populations]] in Greece is difficult to gather and therefore subject to much speculation. In 1986, legal and unauthorized immigrants totaled approximately 90,000. A study from the [http://www.mmo.gr/ Mediterranean Migration Observatory] maintains that the 2001 Census from the NSSG recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of total population and that, of these, 48,560 were EU or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] nationals and 17,426 Cypriots with privileged status. People from the Balkan countries of Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania make up almost two-thirds of the total foreign population. Migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.<ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=228 Greece: A History of Migration] Charalambos Kasimis and Chryssa Kassimi, ''Migration Information Source.'' June 2004.</ref>

The greatest cluster of non-EU immigrant population is in the Municipality of Athens –some 132,000 immigrants, at 17% of local population. Thessaloniki is the second largest cluster, with 27,000, reaching 7% of local population. After this, the predominant areas of location are the big cities environs and the agricultural areas. At the same time, [[Albanians]] constituted some 56% of total immigrants, followed by [[Bulgarians]] (5%), [[Georgians]] (3%) and [[Romanians]] (3%). Americans, Cypriots, British and Germans appeared as sizeable foreign communities at around 2% each of total foreign population. The rest were around 690,000 persons of non-EU or non-homogeneis (of non-Greek heritage) status.

According to the same study, the foreign population (documented and undocumented) residing in Greece may in reality figure upwards to 8.5% or 10.3%, that is approximately meaning 1.15&nbsp;million – if immigrants with ''homogeneis'' cards are accounted for.

Greece is a gateway for the entry of illegal immigrants to Europe. The Cabinet has approved a draft law that would allow children born in Greece to parents who are immigrants, one of whom must have been living in the country legally for at least 5 consecutive years to apply for Greek citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diavatirio.net/diavat/news.php |title=Διαβατήριο - Διαδικτυακό περιοδικό για μετανάστες Ελληνοαλβανικός Σύνδεσμος Φιλίας Σωκράτης: Ειδήσεις |publisher=Diavatirio.net |date= |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> The government, despite strong objections from oppositions is determined to pass the bill. The main objective is to facilitate the smooth integration of legal immigrants and their children in the Greek social reality. The basic criteria remain the legality of residence and children's participation in Greek culture. For the same reason, moreover, long-term residents, political refugees and expatriates will be allowed to participate in local elections.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Greece|Minorities in Greece}}
[[File:Greece linguistic minorities.svg|thumb|left|180px|Regions with a traditional presence of languages other than Greek. Greek is today spoken as the dominant language throughout the country.<ref>See Ethnologue {{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=GR&seq=10 |title=Languages of Greece |publisher=ethnologue.com |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}; Euromosaic, ''Le (slavo)macédonien / bulgare en Grèce'', ''L'arvanite / albanais en Grèce'', ''Le valaque/aromoune-aroumane en Grèce'', and Mercator-Education: European Network for Regional or Minority Languages and Education, ''The Turkish language in education in Greece''. cf. also P. Trudgill, "Greece and European Turkey: From Religious to Linguistic Identity", in S Barbour, C Carmichael (eds.), ''Language and nationalism in Europe'', Oxford University Press 2000.</ref>]]
Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. The [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks|Pomak]]) and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country.

Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountaneous central Greece. Members of these groups ethnically identify as Greeks<ref>[http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&serial=1044526702223 Greek Helsinki Monitor]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}, Minority Rights Group, Greece, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) 8 September 1999</ref> and are today all at least bilingual in Greek. In many areas their traditional languages are today only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction.

Near the northern Greek borders there are also some [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking groups, whose members identify ethnically as Greeks in their majority. Their dialects can be linguistically classified as forms of either [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (locally called ''Slavomacedonian'' or simply ''Slavic''), or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (distinguished as ''Pomak'' in the case of the Bulgarophone Muslims of Thrace.<ref>P. Trudgill, "Greece and European Turkey: From Religious to Linguistic Identity", in S Barbour, C Carmichael (eds.), ''Language and nationalism in Europe'', Oxford University Press 2000.</ref> It is estimated that in the aftermath of the population exchanges of 1923 there were somewhere between 200,000 and 400,000 Slavic speakers in Greek Macedonia.<ref name="minorities"/>

The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (Judeo-Spanish), today maintained only by a small group of a few thousand speakers.

Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Greece}}
[[File:Fronten universitetet.jpg|thumb|The [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] is Greece's [[national academy]] and the highest research establishment in the country.]]

Compulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (Δημοτικό Σχολείο, ''Dimotikó Scholeio'') and [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (Γυμνάσιο). Nursery schools (Παιδικός σταθμός, ''Paidikós Stathmós'') are popular but not compulsory. [[Kindergarten]]s (Νηπιαγωγείο, ''Nipiagogeío'') are now compulsory for any child above 4 years of age. Children start primary school aged 6 and remain there for six years. Attendance at gymnasia starts at age 12 and last for three years.

Greece's post-compulsory secondary education consists of two school types: unified upper secondary schools (Ενιαίο Λύκειο, ''Eniaia Lykeia'') and [[technical school|technical]]–[[vocational school|vocational]] educational schools (Τεχνικά και Επαγγελματικά Εκπαιδευτήρια, "TEE"). Post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes (Ινστιτούτα Επαγγελματικής Κατάρτισης, "IEK") which provide a formal but unclassified level of education. As they can accept both ''Gymnasio'' (lower secondary school) and ''Lykeio'' (upper secondary school) graduates, these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education.

Public higher education is divided into [[university|universities]], "Highest Educational Institutions" (Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα, ''Anótata Ekpaideytiká Idrýmata'', "ΑΕΙ") and "Highest Technological Educational Institutions" (Ανώτατα Τεχνολογικά Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα, ''Anótata Technologiká Ekpaideytiká Idrýmata'', "ATEI"). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery. The [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens|Capodistrian university of Athens]] is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.

The Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. Specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological and physical education also exist.

Some of the main universities in Greece include:

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Greece|List of Greeks}}
[[File:Amphitheatre in Epidavros.jpg|thumb|The ancient theatre of [[Epidaurus]] is nowadays used for staging ancient Greek drama shows.]]

The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, with its beginnings in [[Mycenaean Greece|the Mycenaean and Minoan Civilizations]], continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], the [[Hellenistic Period]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its [[Greek East]]ern successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] too had a significant influence on Greek culture, but the [[Greek War of Independence]] is credited with revitalizing Greece and giving birth to a single entity of its multi-faceted culture throughout the ages.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

Most western philosophical traditions began in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC.The first philosophers are called "Presocratics" which designates that they came before Socrates. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of the original writings of the presocratics survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.

A new period of philosophy started with [[Socrates]]. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.

[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity but while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/greekphi.htm  |title=Greek philosophy from the Internet encyclopedia of philosophy}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main|Greek Literature|Ancient Greek literature}}
[[File:Thermopyles.jpg|thumb|170px|The manuscript of the poem "Thermopyles" (Θερμοπύλες) by [[Constantine P. Cavafy]]. Cavafy's poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and ''milieux'' that have played roles in Greek culture. He is considered probably the greatest modern Greek poet.]]

The timeline of the Greek literature can be separated into three big periods: the ancient, the Byzantine and the modern Greek literature.

At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of [[Homer]]: the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]]. Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&nbsp;BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]]; [[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period.The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]].
The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.


Of the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period.
The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.

[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the [[Byzantine Empire]] written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]].

[[Modern Greek literature]] refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century AD. The Cretan Renaissance poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse [[romance (genre)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553–1613). Later, during the period of [[Diafotismos|Greek enlightenment (Diafotismos)]], writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] will prepare with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821–1830).

Contemporary Greek literature is representated by many writers, poets and novelists: [[Dionysios Solomos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Emmanuel Rhoides]], [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Penelope Delta]], [[Yannis Ritsos]], [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Andreas Embeirikos]], [[Kostas Karyotakis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], [[Demetrius Vikelas]], while [[George Seferis]] and [[Odysseas Elytis]] have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Greek cuisine}}
[[File:GreekSalad.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Greek salad]] with additional ingredients.]]

[[Greek cuisine]] is often cited{{Who|date=March 2010}} as an example of the healthy [[Mediterranean diet]] ([[Cretan diet]]). Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as [[moussaka]], [[stifado]], [[Greek Salad]], [[spanakopita]] and the world famous [[Souvlaki]]. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} (a thick purée of potatoes, walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled [[octopus]] and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.

Sweet desserts such as [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including [[retsina]]. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[garlic]], onion, [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use "sweet" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[cloves]] in stews.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Greece}}
{{double image|right|Mikis2004.jpg|120|MariaCallas.jpg|140|[[Mikis Theodorakis]], one of the most popular Greek songwriters, and [[Maria Callas]], one of the most significant opera singers of the 20th century.}}

Greek vocal music extends far back into Ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Eastern Europe, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] changed Greek music.

While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragodistis) Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, the isolation of [[Byzantium]] after 1453, which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.

[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cretan]] dancers of traditional music.]]

Along with the Byzantine chant, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries A.D. and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]] struggle in 1821. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.

The Second World War, German occupation of Greece and the Greek Civil War decisively influenced the Greek folk song. After the first World War and the 1922 debacle, the trend towards urban living focused on Athens where popular musicians congregated and, in 1928, founded their own professional society: the Athens and Piraeus Musicians Society. Until the early years of this century, musical tradition was preserved in the villages where there was little contact with the outside world.
The events and social changes of the 20th century changed Greek folk song. Once the seat of folk song was the village, now the reverse applies.{{Clarify|It is not apparent what the 'reverse' of 'village' is.|date=November 2010}} The commercialised folk song spreads in all directions to the remotest villages. The authentic songs and dances have been replaced by the stylised modern "folk songs" written by contemporary musicians which they write new lyrics to authentic folk tunes, changing them enough to ensure copyright protection.
