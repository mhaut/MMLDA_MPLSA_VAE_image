Historically, Belgium, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] were known as the [[Low Countries]], which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current [[Benelux]] group of states.  The region was called Belgica in Latin because of the [[Roman province]] [[Gallia Belgica]] which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the battleground<!-- Please don't replace with [[cockfight|cockpit]] without discussing on the talk page --> of Europe,<ref>{{cite web

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the "Federated Netherlands") and the [[Southern Netherlands]] (''Belgica Regia'', the "Royal Netherlands"). The latter were ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[History of Austria#Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711–1780)|Austrian]] [[Habsburg]]s and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish]] and [[War of the Austrian Succession|Franco-Austrian wars]]<!--disambiguation page intended: "most" wars of that list--> during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries—including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège—were annexed by the [[French First Republic]], ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] occurred at the dissolution of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815.

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 ceded control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. In 1908 this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref>{{cite book

The opening months of the war were known as the [[Rape of Belgium]] due to German atrocities. Belgium took over the [[German colonies]] of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]) during the war, and they were mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]]. In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were annexed by Belgium in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority. The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 during the [[Blitzkrieg]] offensive and occupied until its [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|liberation by the Allies]] in 1944. After World War II, [[General strike against Leopold III of Belgium|a general strike]] forced king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]], who many saw as collaborating with the Germans during the war, to abdicate in 1951.

The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region.

These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.<ref name=fedgov2/>

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters.<ref name=fedgov1/> Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers.<ref name=fedgov3>{{cite web

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Belgium}}
[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Polder]]s along the [[Yser]] river]]

Belgium shares borders with [[France]] ({{nowrap|620&nbsp;km}}), [[Germany]] ({{nowrap|167&nbsp;km}}), [[Luxembourg]] ({{nowrap|148&nbsp;km}}) and the [[Netherlands]] ({{nowrap|450&nbsp;km}}). Its total area, including surface water area, is 33,990 square kilometers; land area alone is 30,528&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It lies between latitudes [[49th parallel north|49°]] and [[53rd parallel north|53° N]], and longitudes [[2nd meridian east|2°]] and [[7th meridian east|7° E]].

Belgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin; the [[Ardennes]] uplands in the south-east are part of the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogenic belt]]. The [[Paris Basin (geology)|Paris Basin]] reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, [[Belgian Lorraine]].<ref>{{cite web

The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and [[polder]]s. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the [[Campine]] (''Kempen''). The thickly forested hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small [[canyon|gorges]]. Extending westward into France, this area is eastwardly connected to the [[Eifel]] in Germany by the [[High Fens]] plateau, on which the [[Signal de Botrange]] forms the country's highest point at {{convert|694|m|ft|0}}.<ref>{{cite web

As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their [[dialect]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} However, various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may provide suggested figures. An estimated 59% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as "Flemish"), and French is spoken by 40% of the population.<ref>Native speakers of Dutch living in Wallonia and of French in Flanders are relatively small minorities that furthermore largely balance one another, hence counting all inhabitants of each unilingual area to the area's language can cause only insignificant inaccuracies (99% can speak the language). Dutch: Flanders' 6.079&nbsp;million inhabitants and about 15% of Brussels' 1.019&nbsp;million are 6.23&nbsp;million or 59.3% of the 10.511&nbsp;million inhabitants of Belgium (2006); German: 70,400 in the German-speaking Community (which has [[Municipalities with language facilities|language facilities]] for its less than 5% French-speakers) and an estimated 20,000–25,000 speakers of German in the Walloon Region outside the geographical boundaries of their official Community, or 0.9%; French: in the latter area as well as mainly in the rest of Wallonia (3.414 − 0.093 = 3.321&nbsp;million) and 85% of the Brussels inhabitants (0.866&nbsp;million) thus 4.187&nbsp;million or 39.8%; together indeed 100%.</ref>

Total Dutch speakers are 6.23&nbsp;million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers comprise 3.32&nbsp;million in Wallonia and an estimated 0.87&nbsp;million or 85% of the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.<ref name=ericcorijn>Flemish Academic Eric Corijn (initiator of [http://www.charta91.be/ Charta 91]), at a colloquium regarding Brussels, on 2001-12-05, states that in Brussels there is 91% of the population speaking French at home, either alone or with another language, and there is about 20% speaking Dutch at home, either alone (9%) or with French (11%)—After ponderation, the repartition can be estimated at between 85 and 90% French-speaking, and the remaining are Dutch-speaking, corresponding to the estimations based on languages chosen in Brussels by citizens for their official documents (ID, driving licenses, weddings, birth, sex, and so on); all these statistics on language are also available at Belgian Department of Justice (for weddings, birth, sex), Department of Transport (for Driving licenses), Department of Interior (for IDs), because there are no means to know ''precisely'' the proportions since Belgium has abolished 'official' linguistic censuses, thus official documents on language choices can only be estimations.

===Folklore===

{{See|Folklore of the Low Countries}}

Folklore plays a major role in Belgium's cultural life: the country has a comparatively high number of processions, cavalcades, parades, 'ommegangs' and 'ducasses',<ref>The Dutch word 'ommegang' is here used in the sense of an entirely or mainly non-religious procession, or the non-religious part thereof—see also [[:nl:Ommegang|its article on the Dutch-language Wikipedia]]; the Processional Giants [http://www.visitbelgium.com/mediaroom/Ommegang.htm of Brussels]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}, Dendermonde and Mechelen mentioned in this paragraph are part of each city's 'ommegang'. The French word 'ducasse' refers also to a procession; the mentioned Processional Giants of Ath and Mons are part of each city's 'ducasse'.</ref> '[[kermesse (festival)|kermesse]]' and other local festivals, nearly always with an originally religious or [[mythology of the Low Countries|mythological background]]. The [[Carnival of Binche]] with its famous [[Gilles]] and the 'Processional Giants and Dragons' of [[Ath]], [[Brussels]], [[Dendermonde]], [[Mechelen]] and [[Mons]] are recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].<ref>{{cite web

Other examples are the Carnival of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]]; the still very religious processions of [[procession of the Holy Blood|the Holy Blood]] in [[Bruges]], [[Virga Jesse Basilica]] in [[Hasselt]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Hanswijk]] in Mechelen; 15 August festival in Liège; and the Walloon festival in [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. Originated in 1832 and revived in the 1960s, the [[Gentse Feesten]] have become a modern tradition. A major non-official holiday is the [[Saint Nicholas Day]], a festivity for children and, in Liège, for students.<ref>{{cite web
