==History==
[[Image:Antiek hockey.JPG|thumb|An [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] game, similar to and possibly ancestral to field hockey and [[ground billiards]] ([[relief|bas relief]] dating to ca. 600 BC, in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]).<ref name="Stein & Rubino 2008">{{Stein & Rubino 2008|pp. 2, 5, 27}}</ref>]]
Games played with [[Hockey stick|curved sticks]] and a ball have been found throughout history and the world. There are 4000-year-old drawings from Egypt. [[Hurling]] dates to before 1272 BC in [[Ireland]], and there is a depiction from ca. 600 BC in [[Ancient Greece]] where the game may have been called ''kerētízein'' or ''kerhtízein'' (κερητίζειν) because it was played with a horn (''kéras'', κέρας)<ref>Oikonomos, G. "Κερητίζοντες". ''Archaiologikon Deltion'' 6 (1920-1921): 56-59; there are clear depictions of the game, but the identification with the name κερητίζειν is disputed at http://sarantakos.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/keretizein/ (English summary at http://hellenisteukontos.blogspot.com/2010/03/ancient-greek-field-hockey.html)</ref> or horn-like stick. In [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]], the [[Daur]] people have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/sports/olympics/23hockey.html|title=A Chinese Hinterland, Fertile with Field Hockey|last=McGrath|first=Charles|date=August 22, 2008 |publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> There were hockey-like games throughout Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} and the word "hockey" was recorded in 1363 when [[Edward III]] of England issued the proclamation: "[m]oreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games."<ref name=exp>http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm accessed 2009-03-12</ref>{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

==Field hockey==
[[File:Field hockey.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Field hockey game at [[Melbourne University]].]]	
{{main|Field hockey}}
Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, sand-based or water-based [[artificial turf]], with a small, hard ball. The game is popular among both males and females in many parts of the world, particularly in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. In most countries, the game is played between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.
		
The governing body is the 116-member [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH). Men's field hockey has been played at each [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|summer Olympic Games]] since 1908 (except 1912 and 1924), while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980.
 		
Modern [[field hockey stick]]s are J-shaped and constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon fibre (sometimes both) and have a curved hook at the playing end, a flat surface on the playing side and curved surface on the rear side. 			
While current field hockey appeared in the mid-18th century in [[England]], primarily in schools, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established. The first club was created in 1849 at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in south-east [[London]]. Field hockey is the [[national sport]] of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].<ref>[http://www.surfindia.com/sports/field-hockey.html Hockey,Field Hockey,Hockey Game,Hockey Sports,Hockey History,Hockey India<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Ice hockey==
[[File:The Colts applying pressure at the Battalion net.JPG|250px|thumb|The [[Barrie Colts]] and the [[Brampton Battalion]] in an [[ice hockey]] game.]] 	
{{main|Ice hockey}}
[[Ice hockey]] is played on a large flat area of ice, using a three inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) diameter [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]] disc called a [[hockey puck|puck]]. This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice. The game is contested between two teams of skaters. The game is played all over North America, Europe and in many other countries around the world to varying extent. It is the most popular sport in [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], the [[Czech Republic]], and in [[Slovakia]].

The governing body of international play is the 66-member [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF). Men's ice hockey has been played at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924, and was in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. Women's ice hockey was added to the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in 1998]]. [[North America]]'s [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic ice hockey: the periods are 20 minutes long, counting downwards. There are three periods.
		
[[Ice hockey stick]]s are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, [[graphite#Uses|graphite]], or [[composite materials|composites]] with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way, legally, as to help a [[left-handed|left]]- or [[right-handed]] player gain an advantage.
		
There are early representations and reports of ice hockey-type games being played on ice in the [[Netherlands]], and reports from [[Canada]] from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]] in 1875 who, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.

Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all ages. {{see|minor hockey}}

== Roller hockey ==
===Inline===
[[File:AcesWomenChCh 56.jpg|thumb|200px|Inline roller hockey]] 	 
{{main|Inline hockey}} 	 
[[Inline hockey]] is a variation of [[roller hockey]] very similar to [[ice hockey]], from which it is derived. Inline hockey is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. The game is played in three 15-minute periods with a variation of the ice hockey off-side rule.  Icings are also called, but are usually referred to as illegal clearing. For rink dimensions and an overview of the rules of the game, see IIHF  Inline Rules ([http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/InLineRuleBook2005.pdf official rules]). Some leagues and competitions do not follow the IIHF regulations, in particular [http://www.usahockey.com/inline/ USA Inline] and [http://www.canadainline.com/ Canada Inline].

=== Quad ===

{{main|Roller hockey (quad)}}	 		 
[[Roller hockey (quad)]] is the overarching name for a roller sport that has existed since long before inline skates were invented. Roller hockey has been played in sixty countries worldwide{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} and thus has many names worldwide. The sport is also known as quad hockey, international style ball hockey, rink hockey and hardball hockey. Roller hockey was a demonstration roller sport at the [[Barcelona 1992|1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics]].

==Sledge hockey==
{{Main|Sledge hockey}}
[[Sledge hockey]] is a form of ice hockey designed for players with physical [[disability|disabilities]] affecting their lower bodies. Players sit on double-bladed [[sled]]ges and use two sticks; each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other. Players use the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck, and to propel their sledges. The rules are very similar to [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] ice hockey rules.<ref>{{cite web | last=International Paralympic Committee | authorlink=International Paralympic Committee | title=Ice Sledge Hockey&nbsp;— Rulebook | url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Winter_Sports/Ice_Sledge_Hockey/About_the_sport/Rules/ice_sledge_hockey_rulebook.pdf | accessdate=October 11, 2006|format=PDF}}</ref>

[[Canada]] is a recognized international leader in the development of the sport, and of equipment for players. Much of the equipment for the sport was first developed in Canada, such as sledge [[hockey stick]]s laminated with [[fiberglass]], as well as aluminum shafts with hand carved insert blades and special aluminum sledges with regulation skate blades.

===Inline sledge hockey===
Based on ice sledge hockey, inline sledge hockey is played to the same rules as inline puck hockey (essentially ice hockey played off ice using inline skates) and has been made possible by the design and manufacture of inline sledges by RGK, Europe’s premier sports wheelchair maker.

There is no classification point system dictating who can play inline sledge hockey, unlike the situation with other team sports such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. Inline sledge hockey is being developed to allow everyone, regardless of whether they have a disability or not, to complete up to world championship level based solely on talent and ability.  This makes inline sledge hockey truly inclusive.

The first game of inline sledge hockey was played at Bisley, England, on the 19th of December 2009 between the Hull Stingrays and the Grimsby Redwings.  [[Matt Lloyd, Paralympic Athlete|Matt Lloyd]] is credited with inventing inline sledge hockey, and Great Britain is seen as the international leader in the game's development.

== Street hockey ==
{{main|Street hockey}}
Another form of popular hockey is [[street hockey]], sometimes known as road hockey. This is usually played with the same rules as ice hockey, or roller hockey, but on the street. Most of the time, a ball is used instead of a puck, because a puck generates too much friction on an [[asphalt]] or [[cement]] surface and does not slide. Street hockey is played year round.

==Other forms of hockey==
Other games derived from hockey or its predecessors include the following:
[[Image:Boxhockey1935.jpg|thumb|right|Box Hockey being played in Miami, FL 1935]]
* [[Air hockey]] is played indoors with a puck on an air-cushion table.
* [[Beach hockey]], a variation of street hockey, is a common sight on [[Southern California]] beaches.
* [[Ball hockey]] is played in a gym using sticks and a ball, often a [[tennis]] ball with the fuzz removed.

* [[Bandy]] is played with a ball on a [[association football|football]]-sized ice arena, typically outdoors. 
* [[Box hockey]] is a school yard game played by two people. The object of the game is to move a hockey puck from the center of the box out through a hole placed at the end of the box (known as the goal). Each player kneels and faces one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to the hole on their left.  
* [[Broomball]] is played on an ice hockey rink, but with a ball instead of a puck and a "broom" (actually a stick with a small plastic implement on the end) in place of the ice hockey stick. Instead of using skates, special shoes are used that have very soft rubbery soles to maximize grip while running around.
* [[Floor hockey]] is a form of hockey played on foot,on flat, smooth floor surface. It is usually played inside in gymnasiums and such.   
* [[Floorball]], is a form of hockey played in a gymnasium or in sport halls. A whiffle ball is used instead of a plastic ball, and the sticks are made from composite materials. The sticks are only one meter long.
* [[Foot hockey]] or sock hockey is played using a bald tennis ball or rolled up pair of socks and using only the feet.  It is popular at elementary schools in the winter.  
* Gym hockey is a form of ice hockey played in a gymnasium.  It uses sticks with foam ends and a foam ball or a plastic puck.
* [[Hurling]] and [[Camogie]] are [[Ireland|Irish]] games bearing some resemblance to - and notable differences from - hockey.
* [[Indoor field hockey]] is an indoor variation of field hockey.
* [[Mini hockey]] In the United States is a form of hockey (also known as "mini-sticks") which is played in basements of houses. Players get down on their knees, using a miniature plastic stick, usually about 15&nbsp;inches (38&nbsp;cm) long to maneuver a small ball or a soft, fabric covered mini puck into a miniature goals.  In England 'mini hockey' refers to a seven-a-side version of field hockey, played on an area equivalent to half a normal pitch for younger players
* [[Nok Hockey]] is a table-top version of hockey played with no defense and a small block in front of the goal.
* [[Power hockey]] is a form of hockey for persons requiring the use of an electric (power) wheelchair in daily life.  PowerHockey is a competitive sports opportunity for the physically disabled.
* [[Ringette]] is an ice hockey variant that was designed for female players; it uses a straight stick and a rubber ring in place of a puck. ''Note: Ringette distances itself from hockey as it has its own set of rules and is closely related to a mix of lacrosse and basketball.''
* [[Rinkball]] is a Scandinavian team sport, played in an ice hockey rink with a ball.
* [[Rossall hockey]] is a variation played at [[Rossall School]] on the sea shore in the winter months. Its rules are a mix of field hockey, [[Rugby football|rugby]] and the [[Eton wall game]].

A stick and puck are used as in hockey (the puck is a softer version called a "sponge puck"), and the same soft-soled shoes used in broomball are worn. The rules are basically the same as ice hockey, but one variation has an extra player on the ice called a "rover".
* [[Table hockey games|Table hockey]] is played indoors with a table-top game.
* [[Underwater hockey]] is played on the bottom of a swimming pool.
