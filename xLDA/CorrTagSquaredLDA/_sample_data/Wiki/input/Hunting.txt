'''Hunting''' is the practice of pursuing any living thing (usually [[wildlife]]) for [[food]], [[recreation]], or [[trade]]. In present-day use, the term refers to lawful hunting, as distinguished from [[poaching]], which is the killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species contrary to applicable law. The species which are hunted are referred to as [[game (food)|game]] and are usually [[mammal]]s and [[Bird migration|migratory]] or [[Resident bird|non-migratory]] [[gamebird]]s.

Hunting can also involve the elimination of [[vermin]], as a means of [[pest control]] to prevent diseases caused by overpopulation. Hunting advocates state that hunting can be a necessary component<ref>Williams, Ted.

The pursuit, capture and release, or capture for food of [[fish]] is called [[fishing]], which is not commonly categorized as a form of hunting. [[Trapping (Animal)|Trapping]] is also usually considered a separate activity. Neither is it considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in [[wildlife]] [[photography]] or [[birdwatching]]. The practice of ''hunting'' for [[plant]]s or [[mushrooms]] is a colloquial term for [[foraging]] or [[hunter-gatherer|gathering]].

Skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target have caused the word hunting to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor, as in "bargain hunting" or "hunting down corruption and waste".

== History ==
=== Paleolithic ===
{{See|Hunting hypothesis}}
Hunting has a long  history and may well pre-date the rise of species ''[[Human evolution|Homo sapiens]]''. While our earliest [[Hominidae|Hominid]] ancestors were probably frugivore or omnivore, there is evidence that early [[Homo genus|Homo]], and possibly already [[Australopithecine]]<ref>In 1992, [[trace element]] studies of the strontium/calcium ratios in [[Paranthropus|robust australopithecine]] fossils suggested the possibility of animal consumption, as did a 1994 using stable carbon isotopic analysis. {{cite web | author = Billings, Tom | assessdate = 2007-01-06 | title = Comparative Anatomy and Physiology Brought Up to Date--continued, Part 3B | url = http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-3b.shtml}}</ref> species have used larger animals for [[subsistence]], and that hunting may have been one of the multiple [[environmental factor]]s leading to replacement of [[holocene]] [[megafauna]] by smaller [[herbivores]].<ref>{{cite journal

Of the closest surviving relatives of the human species, ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'', the [[Common Chimpanzee]] has an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] including troop [[predation|hunting]] [[behavior]] based on beta males led by an [[alpha male]], while the less violent [[Bonobo]]s, have a mostly [[frugivorous]] diet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |title=Bonobo social spacing |author=Courtney Laird |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=Davidson College }}</ref>

While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters, the importance of this fact for the final steps in the emergence of the ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' genus out of earlier [[Australopithecines]], with its [[bipedalism]] and production of [[stone tool]]s, and eventually also [[control of fire]], are emphasized in the "[[hunting hypothesis]]", and de-emphasized in scenarios that stress the [[omnivore]] status of humans as their recipe for success, and [[social interaction]], including [[Mating|mating behaviour]] as essential in the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]].

With the establishment of [[language]], [[culture]] and [[origin of religion|religion]], hunting became a [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of [[storytelling|stories]] and [[Mythology|myths]], besides [[ritual]]s such as [[dance]] and [[animal sacrifice]].
Hunting was a crucial component of [[hunter-gatherer]] societies before the [[domestication]] of [[livestock]] and the dawn of [[Neolithic Revolution|agriculture]], beginning about 11,000 years ago. By the [[Mesolithic]], [[Hunting strategy|hunting strategies]] had diversified with the developent of the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] (by 18,000 years ago) and the [[domestication of the dog]] (about 15,000 years ago).

There is fossil evidence for spear use in Asian hunting dating from approximately 16,200 years ago.<ref>{{cite conference

The North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the [[Younger Dryas impact event]], making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought.<ref>American Geophysical Union paper PP43A-01, [http://www.agu.org/meetings/sm07/sm07-sessions/sm07_PP43A.html abstract] retrieved 2007-10-26</ref>

Many species of animals have been hunted and [[Reindeer|caribou/wild reindeer]] "may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting"<ref name=Burch>"In North America and Eurasia the species has long been an important resource--in many areas ''the'' most important resource--for peoples inhabiting the northern [[Taiga|boreal forest]] and tundra regions. Known human dependence on caribou/wild reindeer has a long history, beginning in the Middle Pleistocene (Banfield 1961:170; Kurtén 1968:170) and continuing to the present....The caribou/wild reindeer is thus an animal that has been a major resource for humans throughout a tremendous geographic area and across a time span of tens of thousands of years."

Burch, Jr. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7316%28197207%2937%3A3%3C339%3ATCRAAH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage The Caribou/Wild Reindeer as a Human Resource.] ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 37, No. 3 (Jul., 1972), pp. 339-368.</ref> (see also [[Reindeer Age]]).

Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the [[New World]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Siberia]] as well as all of [[Australia]] until the European [[Age of Discovery]], and they persist in some [[tribal societies]], albeit in rapid decline. Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some [[List of indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples of the Amazonas]] ([[Aché]]), some Central and Southern African [[Bushmen]] ([[Hadza people]], [[Khoisan]]), some peoples of [[New Guinea]] ([[Fayu]]), the [[Mlabri people|Mlabri]] of Thailand and Laos, the [[Vedda people]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and a handful of [[uncontacted peoples]].

====Criticism====
Archaeologist [[Louis Binford]] criticized the idea that early hominids and early humans were [[hunters]]. On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly [[scavengers]], not [[hunters]] <ref> Binford, Louis. R. (1986) Human ancestors: Changing views of their behavior. ''Journal of Anthropological Archaeology'' 3:235-257 </ref>. This idea is gaining popularity among archaeologists and paleoanthropologists. Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of ''confrontational scavenging'' <ref> Blumenschine, Robert J. (1986) ''Early hominid scavenging opportunities: Implications of carcass availability in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro ecosystems''. Oxford, England: B.A.R. </ref> which could have been the leading method of obtaining protein rich meat by our ancestors.

===Antiquity===
[[Image:Diane de Versailles Leochares.jpg|thumb|right|''Artemis with a Hind'', a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] copy of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[sculpture]], circa 325 BC, by [[Leochares]]]]
[[File:Black Figured Olpe depicting the return of a hunter and his dog.jpg|thumb|250px|Ancient Greek [[black-figure pottery]] depicting the return of a hunter and his dog. Made in [[Athens]] between 550-530 BCE, found in [[Rhodes]].]]
Even as [[domestication#Animal Domestication|animal domestication]] became relatively widespread, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply, even after the development of [[agriculture]]. The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included [[protein]], [[bone]] for implements, [[sinew]] for cordage, [[fur]], [[feathers]], [[rawhide]] and [[leather]] used in clothing. The earliest hunting tools would have included rocks, [[spear]]s, the [[atlatl]], [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]]s.

On ancient reliefs, especially from Mesopotamia, kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions, especially from a [[war chariot]]. The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as [[Horned God|the horned god]] [[Cernunnos]], or lunar goddesses of [[classical antiquity]], Greek [[Artemis]] or Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. [[Taboo]]s are often related to hunting, and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a 'reserve' surrounding a temple. [[Euripides]]' tale of Artemis and [[Actaeon]], for example, may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting.

Hunting is still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for [[pastoral]] uses or agriculture. [[Inuit]] peoples in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing. From the skins of [[Marine mammal|sea mammals]], they may make kayaks, clothing, and footwear.

With domestication of the [[dog]], [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] and the [[ferret]], various forms of animal-aided hunting developed including venery ([[scent hound]] hunting, such as [[fox hunting]]), [[coursing]] ([[sight hound]] hunting), [[falconry]] and ferreting. These are all associated with [[medieval hunting]]; in time various [[dog breed]]s were selected for very precise tasks during the hunt, reflected in such names as [[Pointing breed|pointer]] and [[setter]].

===Pastoral and agricultural societies===

Even as agriculture and [[animal husbandry]] became more prevalent, hunting often remained as a part of human culture where the environment and social conditions allowed. Hunting may be used to kill animals which prey upon [[List of domesticated animals|domestic animals]] or to attempt to [[Extirpation|extirpate]] animals seen by humans as competition for resources such as water or forage.

As hunting moved from a subsistence activity to a social one, two trends emerged. One was that of the specialist hunter with special training and equipment. The other was the emergence of hunting as a [[sport]] for those of an upper [[social class]]. The meaning of the word "'''game'''" in [[middle English]] evolved to include an animal which is hunted.

As [[game (food)|game]] became more of a luxury than a necessity, the stylized pursuit of it also became a luxury. Dangerous hunting, as for lions or wild boars, usually on horseback (or from a [[chariot]]) had a function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports. Hunting was considered to be an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of [[war]] in times of peace.

In most parts of [[medieval]] [[Europe]], the [[upper class]] obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was certainly used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen; but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the [[aristocracy]]. The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the [[Robin Hood]] legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they "hunt the King's deer".  In the European medieval period, hunting was considered part of the set of ''[[mechanic arts|seven mechanical arts]]''.

===Use of dogs===
[[Image:Hunting dogs with catch.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hunting dog]]s with [[pheasant]]s]]
Although various animals have been used to aid the hunter, none has been as important as the dog. The domestication of the dog has led to a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] in which the dog has lost its evolutionary independence from humans in exchange for support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Dogs today are used to find, chase and retrieve [[game (food)|game]] and sometimes to kill it. [[Hunting dog]]s allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt.

==Religion==
{{See|Homo Necans}}
Many prehistoric (often [[zoomorph]]) deities are either predators or prey of humans, perhaps alluding to the importance of hunting for most Paleolithic cultures. In many pagan religions, specific rituals are conducted before or after a hunt; the rituals done may vary according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

Often a hunting ground, or the hunt for one or more species, was reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

===Indian and Eastern religions===
[[Hindu scripture|Hindu Scriptures]] describe hunting as an acceptable occupation as well as a sport of the kingly. Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god [[Shiva]] is "''Mrigavyadha''", the deer hunter ("''mriga''" means deer, "''vyadha''" means hunter). In the epic [[Ramayana]], [[Dasharatha]], the father of [[Rama]], is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expedition he accidentally killed [[Shravana]], mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, [[Ravana]] kidnapped his wife [[Sita]] from their hut while [[Rama]] was hunting a golden deer, and his brother [[Lakshman]] went after him. According to the [[Mahabharat]], [[Pandu]], the father of the [[Pandavas]], accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow mistaking them for a deer. [[Krishna]] is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter.

[[Jainism]] teaches to have tremendous respect for all of life. Prohibitions for hunting and meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a [[Jain]].

The first Precept of [[Buddhism]] is the respect for all sentient life. The general approach by all Buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] explained the issue by saying "all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill".

===Christianity and Judaism===
From early Christian times, hunting has been forbidden to [[Roman Catholic Church]] clerics. Thus the "Corpus Juris Canonici" (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting.

Ferraris (s.v. "Clericus", art. 6) gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause, as necessity, utility or "honest" recreation, and with that moderation which is becoming to the [[Ecclesiastical government|ecclesiastical state]]. Ziegler, however (De episc., l. IV, c. xix), thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the laws of the Church.

Nevertheless, although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible, it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese, as was done by synods at Milan, Avignon, Liège, Cologne and elsewhere. [[Benedict XIV]] (De synodo diœces., l. II, c. x) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe, as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. In practice, therefore, the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether.

It is important to note that the Bible places no such restrictions on any Christian, as most do not observe Kosher [[dietary laws]]. Hence [[Protestantism|Protestant]] clerics, Catholic lay parishioners, and Protestants have no religious restrictions on hunting.  This is in accord with what is found in the Bible [[Acts of the Apostles|book of Acts]] 15:28-29 and 1 Timothy 4:4.

Jewish [[Game law|hunting law]], based on the [[Torah]], is similar, permitting hunting of non-preying animals that are additionally considered [[Kosher]] for food, although hunting preying animals for food is strictly prohibited under [[Rabbinic law]].  Hence birds of prey are specifically prohibited and non-Kosher. Hunting for sport, and not for food is also forbidden in Rabbinical Law.

==National traditions==
===New Zealand===
{{Main|Hunting in New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] has a strong hunting culture. The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats. However, once Europeans arrived game animals were introduced by [[Acclimatisation society|acclimatisation societies]] to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource. Deer, pigs, goats, rabbits, [[Tahr]] and Chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain and with no natural predators their population exploded. Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the [[natural environment]] and on agricultural production, but hunters view them as a resource.

===Shikar (India)===
[[Image:Hunting party mandalay1885.jpg|left|thumb|A ''Shikar'' party in [[Mandalay]], [[Burma]], soon after the conclusion of the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1886 when Burma was annexed to [[British India]].]]
During the feudal and colonial epoch on the Indian continent, hunting was a true 'regal sport' in the numerous [[princely states]], as many (Maha)rajas, Nawabs, as well as British officers maintained a whole corps of ''shikari''s, who were native professional hunters. They would be headed by a master of the hunt, who might be styled ''Mir-shikar''. Often these were recruited from the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their [[traditional knowledge]] of environment and hunting techniques. Big game, such as [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal tigers]], might be hunted from the back of an [[elephant]].

Indian [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] are generally antagonistic to hunting, while a few [[sect]]s like the [[Bishnoi]] lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species like the [[antelope]]. India's [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] bans the killing of all wild animals. However, Chief Wildlife Warden may, if he is satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such animal. In such a case, the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property.<ref>[http://www.helplinelaw.com/docs/wildlife/01.php Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]</ref>

===Safari===<!-- This section is linked from [[Safari]] -->
A [[safari]], from a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning a long journey, is an overland journey (especially in [[Africa]]).

Safari as a distinctive way of hunting was popularized by US author [[Ernest Hemingway]] and president [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A safari may consist of several days or even weeks-long journey and camping in the [[The Bush (Australian)|bush]] or [[jungle]], while pursuing [[Game (food)|big game]]. Nowadays, it's often used to describe tours through African [[List of African national parks|national parks]] to watch or hunt wildlife.

Hunters are usually tourists, accompanied by (licensed and highly regulated) professional hunters ("PH"), local guides, [[Skinner (profession)|skinners]] and [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] in more difficult terrains. A special safari type is the ''solo-safari'' where all the [[hunting license|license]] acquiring, stalking, preparation and outfitting is done by the hunter himself.

Photo-safaris were popular even before the advent of [[ecotourism]]. The synonym "bloodless hunt" for hunting with the use of film and a still photo camera was first used by the Polish photographer [[Włodzimierz Puchalski]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===United Kingdom===
[[Image:JohnLeechExcitedNimrod1850.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fox hunting]] in 1850s England]]
{{See also|Hunting and shooting in the United Kingdom|Deer stalking}}

[[Fox hunting]] is the type of hunting most closely associated with the [[United Kingdom]]. Originally a form of [[vermin]] control to protect livestock, it became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victorian]] times, and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike.  Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of [[hare]] with [[hounds]]. [[Sight hound]]s such as [[greyhounds]] may be used to run down hare in [[coursing]] with [[scent hound]]s such as [[beagle]]s. Other sorts of [[foxhound]]s may also be used for hunting [[stag|deer]] or [[American Mink|mink]].  Hunting [[deer]] on foot using stealth without hounds or horses is called [[deer stalking]].

These forms of hunting have been controversial in the UK. [[Animal welfare]] supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary suffering to foxes, horses and hounds.  Proponents argue that it is culturally and perhaps economically important. Using dogs to chase wild mammals was made illegal in February 2005 by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. The issues involved are addressed in the article '''[[fox hunting legislation]]'''.

====Shooting traditions====
The '''shooting''' of game birds, especially [[pheasant]]s still exists in the UK, with the [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]] saying that over a million people per year participate in shooting, although this figure includes [[Game (food)|game]] shooting, [[clay pigeon shooting]] and [[Shooting sports|target shooting]].<ref>[http://www.basc.org.uk/content/shooting/ BASC site]</ref>  Shooting, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for game - around 35 million birds are released onto shooting estates every year, some having been [[factory farming|factory farmed]]. Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions with assistants to help load shotguns. When in position, "beaters" move through the areas of cover swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out. Such events are often called "drives".  The open season for [[grouse]] in the UK begins on August 12, the so-called ''[[Glorious Twelfth]]''. The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the [[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1800-1899#1831|Game Act 1831]].

===United States===
[[Image:Bear hunting Kodiak FWS.jpg|thumb|right|Carrying a [[bear]] trophy head at the [[Kodiak Archipelago]]]]

North American hunting predates the United States by thousands of years, and was an important part of many [[pre-Columbian]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures. Native Americans retain some hunting rights and are exempt from some laws as part of Indian treaties and otherwise under [[federal law]]—examples include [[eagle feather law]]s and exemptions in the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act]]. This is considered particularly important in [[Alaska Native]] communities.

Regulation of hunting is primarily regulated by [[state law]]; additional regulations are imposed through [[United States environmental law]] in the case of [[migratory birds]] and [[endangered species]].

Regulations vary widely from state to state, and govern the areas, time periods, techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted. Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species (often [[vermin]] or [[varmint]]s) for which there are no hunting regulations. Hunters of protected species require a [[hunting license]] in all states, for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite.

Typically game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes. Typical categories, along with example species, are as follows:
*[[Game (food)|Big game]]: [[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], [[moose]], [[elk]], [[caribou]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[pronghorn]], [[boar]], [[javelina]]
*Small Game: [[rabbit]], [[hare]], [[squirrel]], [[oppossum]], [[raccoon]], [[porcupine]], [[skunk]], [[ring-tailed cat]], [[armadillo]]
*Furbearers: [[beaver]], [[red fox]], [[mink]], [[pine martin]], [[musk rat]], [[otter]], [[bobcat]]
*[[Predation|Predators]]: [[cougar]] (mountain lion/panther), [[bear]], [[coyote]]
*[[Upland game bird]]: [[grouse]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[chukar]], [[pheasant]], [[quail]], [[dove]]
*[[Waterfowl]]: [[duck]], [[teal]], [[merganser]], [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]

Hunting big game typically requires a "tag" for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery. Tags may be further restricted to a specific area or "wildlife management unit." [[Waterfowl hunting|Hunting migratory waterfowl]] requires a "duck stamp" from the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]].
[[Image:Camp on Schoodic Lake, ME.jpg|thumb|left|Hunting camp with [[Field dressing deer|dressed deer]] at Schoodic Lake, [[Maine]] in 1905]]

Harvest of animals other than big game is typically restricted by a "bag limit" and a "possession limit." A bag limit is a maximum number of a specific animal species that an individual can harvest in a single day. A possession limit is a maximum number of a specific animal species that can be in an individual's possession at any time.

Guns usage in hunting is also typically regulated by game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for big game hunting often specify a minimum [[caliber]] or [[muzzle energy]] for [[firearm]]s. The use of [[rifle]]s is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high [[population density]] or limited [[Terrain|topographic relief]]. Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns. Specific seasons for [[bow (weapon)|bow]] hunting or [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[black powder]] guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective [[weapons]]. Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture. In fact, 78% of Americans support legal hunting,<ref>[http://www.responsivemanagement.com/download/news/newsrls_09_06.pdf Results] from a 2006 poll done by Responsive Management</ref> but relatively few Americans actually hunt. At the beginning of the 21st century, 6% of Americans hunted. Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate slightly below the national average (5%), and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South (9%), these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states, where 12% of Midwesterners hunted. Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.<ref>National statistics from [[United States Department of the Interior|US Department of the Interior]], Fish and Wildlife Service and [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation, 27.</ref> Overall in the 1996&ndash;2006 period, the number of hunters over the age of 16 declined by 10%, a drop attributable to a number of factors including [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] and changes in recreation habits.<ref>Jackson, Patrick. [http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070906/NEWS/709060368/1006/NEWS ''Number of hunters is dwindling&mdash;Urbanization and cultural changes discourage newcomers to the sport''], The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware) 2007-09-06, retrieved 2007-10-30.</ref>

Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century. Some modern hunters see themselves as [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] and sportsmen in the mode of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]]. Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use. Some groups represent a specific hunting interest, such as [[Ducks Unlimited]], [[Pheasants Forever]] or [[Delta Waterfowl Foundation]]. Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government.

Each year, nearly $200 million in hunters' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs, the purchase of lands open to hunters, and hunter education and safety classes. Since 1934 the sale of [[Federal Duck Stamp]]s, a required purchase for migratory [[waterfowl]] hunters over 16 years old, has raised over $700 million to help purchase more than 5.2 million acres (8,100&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi/20,000&nbsp;km²) of habitat for the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]] lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species, and are often open to hunting. States also collect monies from hunting licenses to assist with management of [[Game (food)|game animals]], as designated by law. A key task of Federal and state [[Park Ranger|park rangers]] and [[game warden]]s is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting, including species protection, hunting seasons, and hunting bans.

'''Varmint hunting''' is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests. While not always an efficient form of pest control, varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated. Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops, livestock, [[landscaping]], infrastructure, and pets. Some animals (such as wild [[rabbit]]s or [[squirrel]]s) may be utilized for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass. Which species are "varmints" depends on the circumstance and area. Common varmints may include various rodents, [[coyotes]], [[crow]]s, [[fox]]es, [[feral cats]], and feral hogs. Some animals once considered varmints are now protected, such as [[wolf|wolves]]. In the US state of [[Louisiana]], a non-native rodent known as a [[nutria]] have become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population. Feral dogs and cats, rats, starlings, English sparrows, and pigeons may be hunted without a hunting license in the United States.

====Fair chase====
[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen-En uheldig bjørnejakt.jpg|thumb|300px|''En uheldig bjørnejakt'' (An Unfortunate Bear Hunt) by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]]] The principles of the ''Fair Chase''<ref>Interpretations of the Fair Chase can be found on the web sites of various hunter's organizations, such as the [http://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_fairchase.asp?area=huntingEthics Boone and Crockett Club] and [http://www.huntfairchase.com/ Hunt Fair Chase]. See also  [http://www.donmeredith.ca/outdoorsmen/FairChase.html ''What's Fair?''], by Don Meredith, retrieved 2007-10-30.</ref> have been a part of the American hunting tradition for over 100 years. The role of the hunter-conservationist, popularized by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], has been central to the development of the modern Fair Chase tradition. When [[internet hunting]] was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticized by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the NRA explained, "[t]he NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting."<ref name=HSUS-FactSheet>Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting]</ref>

===Ranches===
Indian [[Blackbuck]], [[Nilgai]], [[Axis Deer]], [[Fallow Deer]] and [[Barasingha]] can now be found on hunting [[ranches]] in [[Texas]], [[USA]] where they are introduced for [[sport]] hunting. Hunters can pay upwards of $4000 as fees for hunting a Barasingha.

===Russia===
{{Main|Hunting in Russia}}
The Russian imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers ([[Grand Prince]]s and [[Tsar#Russia|Tsars]]), under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organized mainly in [[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]] and [[Gatchina]].

==Wildlife management==
Hunting gives [[Wildlife management|resource managers]] an important tool<ref>[http://www.uga.edu/scwds/documents/chardonnet2002.pdf (article link)] Chardonnet P, des Clers B, Fischer J, Gerhold R, Jori F, Lamarque F.

[http://www.nature.org/magazine/autumn2006/features/art18601.html ''Today’s sportsmen and sportswomen are a powerful force for conservation''], The Nature Conservancy Magazine, retrieved 2007-10-30.</ref> in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species or, in some instances, damage human health or safety.<ref>The [http://www.fws.gov/hunting/ hunting section of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] site includes articles and statistics relating to wildlife management.</ref> Hunting reduces [[intraspecific competition]] for food and shelter, reducing mortality among the remaining animals. Some environmentalists assert{{Who|date=December 2009}} that (re)introducing [[predator]]s would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and [[food chain]]. Hunters often disagree, arguing that hunting is more selective, removing fewer old, sick, or young animals than natural predation. [[Aldo Leopold]], an early environmentalist and hunter, also believed hunting could be used to manage animal populations.

Management agencies sometimes rely on hunting to control specific animal populations, as has been the case with deer in North America. These hunts may sometimes be carried out by professional shooters although others may include amateur hunters.  Many U.S. city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each year to reduce populations of animals that are becoming hazardous, like deer, in a restricted area, such as neighborhood parks and metropolitan open spaces.

A large part of managing populations involves managing the number and, sometimes, the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the sustainability of the population. Tools which are frequently used to control harvest are bag limits and season closures, although gear restrictions such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort to reduce hunter success rates.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Bag limits===
{{Main|Bag limits}}
'''Bag limits''' are provisions under the law which control how many animals of a given species or group of species can be killed, although there are often species for which bag limits do not apply. There are also jurisdictions where bag limits are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. Where bag limits are used, however, there can be daily or seasonal bag limits. For example, [[ducks]] can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day.<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2003/n03-015.html US Fish and Wildlife Service 2003 proposed bag limits for waterfowl]</ref> Big game, like [[moose]], most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per hunter.<ref>[http://www.bowhunts.com/moose_reg.html An overview of moose hunting regulations in Canada]</ref> Bag limits may also regulate the size, sex or age of animal that a hunter can kill. In many cases, bag limits are designed to more equitably allocate harvest among the hunting population rather than to protect animal populations. The phrase "bag limits" comes from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a [[fishing creel]].

===Closed season===
A '''[[closed season]]''' is a "hunting" [[Technical terminology|term]] used to describe a time during which hunting an animal of a given species is contrary to law. Typically, closed seasons are designed to protect a species when they are most vulnerable or, sometimes, to protect them during their [[breeding season]].<ref>[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenrt.nsf/childdocs/-7380F92E35E27D99CA2573750023D375-DE772B04C4005AEDCA25737500243226?open When can I hunt, Game Hunting, Recreation and Tourism; The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE), Government of Victoria, Australia.], Accessed 04 December 2008.</ref> By extension, the period that is not the closed season is known as the '''[[Open season (hunting)|open season]]'''.

===Laws===
Illegal hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and [[wildlife management]] laws is termed as "'''[[Poaching]]'''". Violations of hunting laws and regulations are normally punishable by law and, collectively, such violations are known as poaching.

==Methods==

Historical, subsistence and sport hunting techniques can differ radically, with modern hunting regulations often addressing issues of where, when and how hunts are conducted. Techniques may vary depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local custom, hunting-equipment and the animal being hunted. Often a hunter will use a combination of more than one technique. Laws may forbid sport hunters from using some methods used primarily in [[poaching]] and [[wildlife management]].

==Trophy hunting==
[[Image:Usov.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Royal Liechtenstein]] trophy collection at [[Úsov]] Château, the [[Czech Republic]]]]
{{Main|Trophy hunting}}
Trophy hunting is the selective seeking of wild game. It may also include the controversial hunting of captive or semi-captive animals expressly bred and raised under controlled or semi-controlled conditions so as to attain trophy characteristics (canned hunts).

===History===
In the 19th century, southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a [[trophy]], usually the head or pelt of an animal, which was then displayed as a sign of prowess. The rest of the animal was typically discarded. Some cultures, however, disapprove of such waste. In [[Nordic countries]], hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon. Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. The [[Hunting#Safari|safari]] method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies. In modern times, [[trophy hunting]] persists and is a significant industry in some areas.

===Controversy===
Trophy hunting is most often criticized when it involves rare or [[endangered]] animals.<ref>[http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=28737&SESSION=875 Early Day Motion on trophy hunting]</ref>  Opponents may also see trophy hunting as an issue of [[morality]]<ref>see, for example, [http://flaflooga.com/trophy_hunting.php this internet page]</ref> or [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], criticising the killing of living creatures for recreation.  [[Victorian era]] dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] remarked, "[[Deer-stalking]] would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns."<ref>[[George Grossmith|Grossmith, George]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 1911</ref>

There is also debate about the extent to which trophy hunting benefits the local economy. Hunters argue that fees paid contribute to the local economy and provide value to animals that would otherwise be seen as competition for grazing, livestock, and crops.<ref>Martin, Glen. [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/10/06/MNG1UF392D1.DTL ''The lion, once king of vast African savanna, suffers alarming decline in population''], San Francisco Chronicle, October 6, 2005. Retrieved 2007-10-30.</ref> This analysis is disputed by opponents of trophy hunting.<ref>League Against Cruel Sports. [http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_279.pdf ''The Myth of Trophy Hunting as Conservation''], December 2004. Retrieved 2007-10-30.</ref> Some argue that the animals are worth more to the community for ecotourism, than hunting.<ref>The [http://www.ecotourism.org/ International Ecotourism Society] has published articles along this line.</ref>

==Economics==
[[File:AM Hunting Lodge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Chatelherault Country Park|Chatelherault]], built by [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] in 1743 as the [[James Douglas-Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton's]] hunting lodge.]]
A variety of [[industry|industries]] benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds. In Tanzania, it is estimated that a safari hunter spends 50-100 times that of the average eco-tourist. The average photo tourist may demand luxury accommodations. In contrast, the average safari hunter stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the average eco-tourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the United Kingdom, the game hunting of birds as an industry is said{{Who|date=December 2008}} to be extremely important to the rural economy: The Cobham Report of 1997 suggested it to be worth around [[Pound sterling|£]]700 million, and hunting and shooting lobby groups now claim it to be worth over a billion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States, with many companies specializing in hunting [[sports equipment|equipment]] or specialty [[tourism]]. Today's hunters come from a broad range of economic, social, and cultural backgrounds. In 2001, over 13 million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting and spent over $20.5 billion on their sport. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}In the U.S., proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs including preservation of wildlife habitat.

== Conservation ==
{{POV-section|date=January 2009}}
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
{{Globalize|United States and Canada related section|date=December 2009}}
{{Main|Conservation (ethic)|Conservation movement}}
Hunters have been driving forces throughout history in the movement to ensure long-term sustainability of [[natural resource]]s and [[habitat (ecology)|wildlife habitats]].  Hunters established game parks in Medieval Europe such as the [[New Forest]], with cruel punishments for poaching.  In more egalitarian modern times, hunters have founded some of the most significant wildlife conservation organizations such as [[Ducks Unlimited]]. Hunters in industrialized nations generally comply with [[bag limits]] to ensure the [[sustainability]] of wildlife populations. Many contribute actively to preserving and protecting wildlife habitats internationally, knowing from experience that uncontrolled hunting can result in population crashes, as it did in the U.S. in the 19th century, when common wild species that had been staple foods - most famously the [[passenger pigeon]] - were unexpectedly hunted to extinction.

===Lobbying===
Hunters have worked closely with local and federal governments to enact legislation to protect wildlife habitats.  The following examples represent hunter-advocated legislation enacted to generate funds for preserving and establishing habitats.(Hunters Rule)

The [[Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters]] successfully lobbied to prevent cuts in funding for the Community Fisheries and Wildlife Involvement Program by 50%.

==== Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937 ====
In 1937, hunters successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, which placed an 11% tax on all hunting equipment. This self-imposed tax now generates over $700 million each year and is used exclusively to establish, restore and protect wildlife habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/federalaid/pittmanrobertson.html|title=The Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]|accessdate=11 May 2007}}</ref>  It is named for Nevada Senator [[Key Pittman]] and Virginia Congressman [[Absalom Willis Robertson]].

====Federal Duck Stamp program====
On March 16, 1934 President Roosevelt signed the [[Federal Duck Stamp|Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act]], which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen.  The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the U.S. Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest.  They play an important role in [[habitat conservation]] because 98% of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the [[National Wildlife Refuge|National Wildlife Refuge System]]. In addition to waterfowl, it is estimated that one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using [[Federal Duck Stamp|Duck Stamp]] funds. Since 1934, the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $670M and helped to purchase or lease 5.2 million acres (21,000&nbsp;km²) of habitat. The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds, an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities. Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps, 87% of their sales are contributed to hunters. Distribution of funds is managed by The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission (MBCC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/realty/mbcc.html|title=Migratory Bird Conservation Commission|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]|accessdate=31 May 2007}}</ref>

===Conservation organizations===
There are a number of organizations founded by hunters and by those interested in preserving wildlife populations and habitats. One of the oldest and most well-known organizations is [[Ducks Unlimited]]. Another internationally recognized hunters' conservation organization is [[Safari Club International]].
