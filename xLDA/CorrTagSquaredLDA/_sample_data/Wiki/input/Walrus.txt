The '''walrus''' (''Odobenus rosmarus'') is a large [[pinniped|flippered]] [[marine mammal]] with a discontinuous circumpolar distribution in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[sub-Arctic]] seas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The walrus is the only living species in the '''Odobenidae''' [[family (biology)|family]] and '''''Odobenus''''' [[genus]]. It is subdivided into three [[subspecies]]:<ref name=msw3/> the '''Atlantic Walrus''' (''O. rosmarus rosmarus'') which lives in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the '''Pacific Walrus''' (''O. rosmarus divergens'') which lives in the [[Pacific Ocean]], and '''''O. rosmarus laptevi''''', which lives in the [[Laptev Sea]].

The walrus is immediately recognized by its prominent [[tusk]]s, [[Vibrissa|whiskers]] and great bulk. Adult Pacific males can weigh up to {{convert|1700|kg|lb}}<ref name="Walrus: Physical Characteristics">{{cite web|title = Walrus: Physical Characteristics|url = http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/walrus/phycharwal.html}}</ref> and, among [[pinniped]]s, are exceeded in size only by the two species of [[elephant seal]]s.<ref name="Fay85">{{cite journal|author = Fay, F.H.|year = 1985|url = http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/default.html|title = Odobenus rosmarus|journal = [[Mammalian Species]]|volume = 238|pages = 1–7|doi = 10.2307/3503810|issue = 238|jstor = 3503810}}</ref> It resides primarily in shallow oceanic [[Continental shelf|shelf]] habitat, spending a significant proportion of its life on sea ice in pursuit of its preferred diet of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[bivalvia|bivalve mollusks]]. It is a relatively long-lived, social animal and is considered a [[keystone species]] in Arctic marine [[ecosystem]]s.

The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous Arctic peoples]], who have hunted the walrus for its [[meat]], [[fat]], [[skin]], tusks and [[bone]]. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the walrus was the object of heavy commercial exploitation for [[blubber]] and [[walrus ivory|ivory]] and its numbers declined rapidly. Its global population has since rebounded, though the Atlantic and Laptev populations remain fragmented and at historically depressed levels.

==Etymology==
[[File:Walrus on Carta Marina.jpeg|left|thumb|A walrus, labeled "''Ros marus piscis''", depicted in а 16th century map of Scandinavia (the [[Carta Marina]]).]]
The origin of ''walrus'' has variously been attributed to combinations of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] words ''walvis'' ("whale") and ''ros'' ("horse")<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/walrus Dictionary.com]</ref> or ''wal'' ("shore") and ''reus'' ("giant").<ref>[http://iberianature.com/britainnature/miscellaneous/etymology-of-mammal-names-in-english/ Etymology of mammal names, iberianature.com]</ref> However, the most likely origin of the word is the [[Old Norse]] ''hrossvalr,'' meaning "horse-whale", which was passed in an inverted form to Dutch and the North-German dialects as ''walros'' and ''Walross''.<ref>Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966</ref> 

The now archaic English word for walrus—''morse''—is widely supposed to have come from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]].<ref>"morse, n., etymology of" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. http://dictionary.oed.com/</ref> Thus ''морж'' (morž) in [[Russian language|Russian]], ''mursu'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''moršâ'' in [[Saami language|Saami]], and ''morse'' in [[French language|French]]. [[Olaus Magnus]], who depicted the walrus in the [[carta marina]] in 1539, first referred to it as the ''ros marus'', likely a Latinization of ''morž'', and this was adopted by [[Linnaeus]] in the [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Allen1880>{{cite book|year = 1880|author = Joel Asaph Allen|title = History of North American pinnipeds, US Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territorie|publisher = Arno Press Inc. (1974 reprint)|url = http://books.google.com/?id=jFspFxseyC8C&printsec=frontcover&q|isbn = 9780405057021}}</ref> The coincidental similarity between "morsus" and the Latin for "death" (''mors'') and "to bite" (''mordere'') supposedly contributed to the walrus' reputation as a "terrible monster".<ref name=Allen1880/>

The compound ''Odobenus'' comes from ''odous'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "tooth") and ''baino'' (Greek for "walk"), based on walrus observations using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. The term ''divergens'' in [[Latin]] means "turning apart", referring to the tusks.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The walrus is a mammal in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. It is the sole surviving member of the [[family (biology)|family]] Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the [[suborder]] [[Pinnipedia]] along with true seals ([[Phocidae]]) and eared seals ([[Otariidae]]). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are [[monophyletic]], i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or [[diphyletic]], recent genetic evidence suggests that all three descended from a [[caniform]] ancestor most closely related to modern [[bear]]s.<ref name=Lento1995>{{cite journal|author = Lento, G.M., Hickson, R.E., Chambers, G.K., Penny, D.|year = 1995|title = Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume = 12|issue = 1|pages = 28–52}}</ref> Recent multigene analysis indicates that the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids approximately 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago.<ref name=Arnason06>{{cite journal|author = Arnason U, Gullberg A, Janke A, et al.|year = 2006|title = Pinniped phylogeny and a new hypothesis for their origin and dispersal|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 41|issue = 2|pages = 345–354|doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.05.022|pmid = 16815048}}</ref><ref name=Higdon07>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245807/?tool=pubmed|title=Phylogeny and divergence of the pinnipeds (Carnivora: Mammalia) assessed using a multigene dataset|author=Jeff W Higdon, Olaf RP Bininda-Emonds, Robin MD Beck, and Steven H Ferguson|journal=BMC Evol Biol. 2007|volume=7|page=216|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-216|pmc=2245807|pmid=17996107|year=2007}}</ref> Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Kohno, N.|year = 2006|title = A new Miocene Odobenid (Mammalia: Carnivora) from Hokkaido, Japan, and its implications for odobenid phylogeny|journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume = 26|issue = 2|page = 411|doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[411:ANMOMC]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining ([[relict]]) species.

Two subspecies are commonly recognized: the Atlantic Walrus, ''O. r. rosmarus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Pacific Walrus, ''O. r. divergens'' (Illiger, 1815). Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated at 500,000 and 785,000 years ago.<ref name=Hoelzel2002>{{cite book|editor = Hoelzel, A. R. (Ed.)|year = 2002|title = Marine mammal biology: an evolutionary approach|location = Oxford|publisher = Blackwell Publishing |isbn = 0632 05232 5}}</ref> These dates coincide with the fossil-derived hypothesis that the walrus evolved from a tropical or sub-tropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic.<ref name=Hoelzel2002/> From there, it presumably re-colonized the North Pacific during high glaciation periods in the [[Pleistocene]] via the [[Central American Seaway]].<ref name="Arnason06"/> An isolated population in the [[Laptev Sea]] is considered by some, including Russian biologists and the canonical ''Mammal Species of the World'',<ref name=msw3/> to be a third subspecies, ''O. r. laptevi'' (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Chapskii, K.K. 1940|title = Distribution of the walrus in the Laptev and East Siberian seas|journal = Problemy Severa|volume = 1940|issue = 6|pages = 80–94}}</ref> Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remains under debate.<ref name="Fay85"/><ref>{{cite book|author = Born, E.

[[File:Walrus2.jpg|thumb|right|Young male Pacific Walruses on Cape Pierce in [[Alaska]]. Note the variation in the curvature and orientation of the tusks and the bumpy skin (bosses), typical of males.|alt=Photo of several walruses, with prominently displayed white pairs of tusks]]

==Anatomy==
[[File:WalrusBreathing.jpg|thumb|right|Walrus using its tusks to hang on breathing hole in the ice near [[St. Lawrence Island]], Bering Sea|alt=Photo of walrus in ice-covered sea]]
[[File:WalrusLyd2.png|thumb|right|Skeleton|alt=Drawing of walrus skeleton]]

While isolated Pacific males can weigh as much as {{convert|2000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, most weigh between {{convert|800|and|1800|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Females weigh about two-thirds as much, and the Atlantic subspecies weighs about 90% as much as the Pacific subspecies.<ref name="Fay85"/> The Atlantic Walrus also tends to have relatively shorter tusks and somewhat more flattened [[snout]]. It is the second largest pinniped, after the [[elephant seals]]. 

The walrus' body shape shares features with both sea lions ([[eared seal]]s: Otariidae) and seals ([[earless seal|true seals]]: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements.<ref name="Fay85"/> Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.

===Tusks and dentition===
The most prominent feature of the walrus is the long tusks. These are elongated [[canine teeth|canines]], which are present in both sexes and can reach a length of {{convert|1|m}} and weigh up to {{convert|5.4|kg}}.<ref>{{cite book|author = Berta, A. and J. L. Sumich|year = 1999|title = Marine mammals: evolutionary biology|publisher = Academic Press|location = San Diego, CA|pages = 494 pp.}}</ref> Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males, who use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice.<ref name="Fay82">{{cite journal|author = Fay, F. H.|year = 1982|title = Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus, Odobenus rosmarus divergens Illiger|journal = United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> It was previously assumed that tusks were used to dig out prey from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate that they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging.<ref name="Ray06">{{cite journal|author = Ray, C., McCormick-Ray, J., Berg, P., Epstein, H.E.,|year = 2006|title = Pacific Walrus: Benthic bioturbator of Beringia|journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|pages = 403–419|doi = 10.1016/j.jembe.2005.12.043|volume = 330}}</ref> While the [[dentition]] of walruses is highly variable, they generally have relatively few teeth other than the tusks. The maximal number of teeth is 38 with dentition formula: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.3.2}}, but over half of the teeth are rudimentary and occur with less than 50% frequency, such that a typical dentition includes only 18 teeth {{DentalFormula|upper=1.1.3.0|lower=0.1.3.0}} <ref name="Fay85"/>

===Vibrissae===
Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial [[vibrissa]]e'), giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance. There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching {{convert|30|cm}} in length, though in the wild they are often worn to a much shorter length due to constant use in foraging.<ref name=Kastelein1990>{{cite journal|author = Kastelein, R.A., Stevens, S., & Mosterd, P.|year = 1990|title = The sensitivity of the vibrissae of a Pacific Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Part 2: Masking|journal = Aquatic Mammals|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 78–87}}</ref> The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves making them a highly sensitive organ capable of differentiating shapes {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|2|mm|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name="Kastelein1990"/>

===Skin===
Aside from the vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} around the neck and shoulders of males. The [[blubber|blubber layer]] beneath is up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a [[secondary sexual characteristic]], males also acquire significant nodules, called ''bosses'', particularly around the neck and shoulders.<ref name="Fay82"/> 

The walrus has an [[throat sac|air sac under its throat]] which acts like a floatation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water and sleep. The males possess a large [[baculum]] (penis bone), up to {{convert|63|cm|abbr=on}} in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size.<ref name="Fay85"/>

==Life history==
[[File:Noaa-walrus12.jpg|thumb|left|Walruses fighting|alt=Photo of 5 walruses on rocky shore]]

===Reproduction===
Walruses live to about 20–30 years old in the wild.<ref>{{cite journal|author = F.H. Fay| year = 1960|title = Carnivorous walrus and some arctic zoonoses|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic13-2-111.pdf|journal = Arctic|volume = 13|issue = 2|pages = 111–122}} [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic14-1-76.pdf Comment]</ref> The males reach sexual maturity as early as 7 years, but do not typically mate until fully developed around 15 years of age.<ref name="Fay85"/> They rut from January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females begin ovulating as soon as 4–6 years old.<ref name="Fay85"/> The females are [[polyestrous]], coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.<ref>{{cite journal|author = S. N. Nowicki, I. Stirling, B. Sjare|year = 1997|title = Duration of stereotypes underwater vocal displays by make Atlantic walruses in relation to aerobic dive limit|journal = Marine Mammal Science|volume = 13|issue = 4|pages = 566–575|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.1997.tb00084.x}}</ref> The females join them and copulate in the water.<ref name="Fay82"/> 

[[Gestation]] lasts 15 to 16 months. The first 3 to 4 months are spent with the [[blastula]] in suspended development before it implants itself in the placenta. This strategy of [[delayed implantation]], common among pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season, determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Sandell, M.|year = 1990|title = The Evolution of Seasonal Delayed Implantation|journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume = 65|issue = 1|pages = 23–42|doi = 10.1086/416583|pmid = 2186428}}</ref> Calves are born during the spring migration, from April to June. They weigh {{convert|45|to(-)|75|kg|abbr=on}} at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to 3 to 5 years with the mothers.<ref name="Fay82"/> Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most every two years, leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.<ref>{{cite book|editor = Evans, P.G.H. & Raga, J.A. (eds)|year = 2001|title = Marine mammals: biology and conservation|location = London & New York|publisher = Springer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=riDDOeRd9JAC&printsec=frontcover|isbn=0306465736}}</ref>

===Migration===
The rest of the year (late summer and fall) the walrus tends to form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific Walruses migrate from the Bering sea into the Chukchi sea through the relatively narrow [[Bering Strait]].<ref name="Fay82"/>

==Ecology==
===Range and habitat===
[[File:Walross kolonie.jpg|thumb|right|Walrus colony|alt=Photo of hundreds of animals, lying on the ground]] 
The majority of the Pacific Walrus population summers north of the [[Bering Strait]] in the [[Chukchi Sea]] along the north shore of eastern [[Siberia]], around [[Wrangel Island]], in the [[Beaufort Sea]] along the north shore of [[Alaska]], and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the [[Gulf of Anadyr]] on the south shore of Siberia's [[Chukchi Peninsula]] and in Bristol Bay off the south shore of southern Alaska west of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. In the spring and fall they congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the west shores of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter in the Bering Sea along the eastern shore of Siberia south to the northern part of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], and along Alaska's southern shore.<ref name="Fay85"/> A 28,000 year old fossil walrus specimen was dredged out of [[San Francisco Bay]], indicating that the Pacific Walrus ranged far south during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Dyke, A.S., J.

The much smaller Atlantic population ranges from the Canadian Arctic, [[Greenland]], [[Svalbard]] and the western portion of the Russian Arctic. There are eight presumed sub-populations based largely on geographical distribution and movement data, five to the west of Greenland and three to the east.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Born, E.

The isolated Laptev population is confined year-round to the central and western regions of the [[Laptev Sea]], the easternmost regions of the [[Kara Sea]], and the westernmost regions of the [[East Siberian Sea]]. Current populations are estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals.<ref name=MNRRF>{{cite web|title = Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation protected species list|url = http://zapoved.ru/?act=oopt_rb_more&id=262| accessdate = October 4, 2007}}</ref>

Their limited diving ability brings them to depend on shallow waters (and appropriate nearby ice coverage) to enable them to reach their preferred benthic prey.

===Population===
There were roughly 200,000 Pacific Walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.<ref>{{ cite journal|author = Gilbert, J.R., G.A. Fedoseev, D. Seagars, E. Razlivalov, and A.

[[File:Walross paar.jpg|thumb|right|Walruses leaving the water|alt=Photo of two walruses in shallow water facing shore]]

Walruses prefer shallow [[Continental shelf|shelf]] regions and forage primarily on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms.<ref name="Fay85"/> They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds: the deepest recorded dives are around {{convert|80|m}}. They can remain submerged for as long as half an hour.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Schreer, J. F., K. M. Kovacs, and R. J. O'Hara Hines|year = 2001|title = Comparative diving patterns of pinnipeds and seabirds|journal = Ecological Monographs|volume = 71|pages = 137–162|doi = 10.1890/0012-9615(2001)071[0137:CDPOPA]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> 

The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms including [[shrimp]], [[crab]]s, [[tube worm]]s, soft [[coral]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s, various [[mollusk]]s, and even parts of other pinnipeds.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Sheffield G., Fay F.

The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.

Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs ([[bioturbation|bioturbates]]) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the [[benthos]].<ref name="Ray06"/>

Seal tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific, but the importance of seals in the walrus diet is under debate.<ref>{{cite book|author = Lowry, L.F. and Frost, K.J.|year = 1981|chapter = Feeding and Trophic Relationships of Phocid Seals and walruses in the Eastern Bering Sea|title = The Eastern Bering Sea Shelf: Oceanography & Resources vol. 2.|editor = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|publisher = University of Washington Press|pages = 813–824}}</ref> There have been rare documented incidents of predation on seabirds, particularly the [[Brünnich's Guillemot]] ''Uria lomvia''.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Mallory, M.

===Predation===
Due to its great size, the walrus has only two natural predators: the [[orca]] and the [[polar bear]]. It does not, however, comprise a significant component of either predator's diet. The polar bear hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming individuals that are crushed or wounded in the sudden exodus, typically younger or infirm animals.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Ovsyanikov, N.|year = 1992|title = Ursus ubiquitous|journal = BBC Wildlife|volume = 10|issue = 12|pages = 18–26}}</ref> However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European [[Seal hunting|sealers]] and [[Whaling|whalers]], leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Bockstoce, J.R. and D.B.

Traditional hunters used all parts of the walrus.<ref>{{cite web|last = US Fish and Wildlife Service|title = Hunting and Use of Walrus by Alaska Natives|year = 2007|url = http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/mtrp/pdf/factsheet_walrus.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The meat, often preserved, is an important winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas; etc. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets,<ref>{{cite journal|author = Eleanor, E.W., M.M.R. Freeman, and J.C. Makus|year = 1996|title = Use and preference for Traditional Foods among Belcher Island Inuit|journal = Artic|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 256–264}}</ref> and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.

Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in [[Russia]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Denmark]] and representatives of the respective hunting communities. An estimated 4–7,000 Pacific Walruses are harvested in [[Alaska]] and Russia, including a significant portion (approx. 42%) of struck and lost animals.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Fish.

The effects of [[global climate change]] is another element of concern. The extent and thickness of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates.<ref>{{cite news|first = M|last = Kaufman|title = Warming Arctic Is Taking a Toll, Peril to Walrus Young Seen as Result of Melting Ice Shelf|url = http://www.ngsednet.org/news/sample.cfm|work = Washington Post|page = A7|date = 2006-04-15}}</ref> Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the [[Chukchi Sea]] between eastern Russia and western Alaska.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/science/earth/03walrus.html?ref=todayspaper NY Times, Global warming could reverse a walrus comeback, 3 Oct 2009]</ref><ref>[http://wwfblogs.org/climate/content/arctic-sea-ice-reaches-annual-minimum-large-number-walrus-corpses-found-along-alaska-shoreli World Wildlife Fund, As Arctic Sea ice reaches annual minimum, large number of walrus corpses found, 18 Sept 2009]</ref> However, there is insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.<ref>{{cite news|first = Michael|last = Lemonick|title =

Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as "least-concern" by the [[IUCN]], while the third is "data deficient".<ref name=iucn/> The Pacific Walrus is not listed as "depleted" according to the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act]] nor as "threatened" or "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category 2 (decreasing) and Category 3 (rare) in the Russian [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation|Red Book]].<ref name=MNRRF/> Global trade in [[walrus ivory]] is restricted according to a [[CITES]] Appendix 3 listing.

The walrus plays an important role in the [[religion]] and [[folklore]] of many [[Arctic]] peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] version of the widespread [[Raven in mythology|myth of the Raven]], in which [[Kutkh|Raven]] recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus — possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids.<ref name="Bogoras">W. Bogoras. (1902) The Folklore of Northeastern Asia, as Compared with That of Northwestern America. ''American Anthropologist, New Series'', Vol. 4, No. 4. (Oct. – Dec., 1902), pp. 577–683.</ref> This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]]. Both in [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] and [[Alaska]], the [[aurora borealis]] is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.<ref name="Bogoras"/><ref>Boas, F. 1901. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. History, Vol. xvr, Pt. I. New York, p. 146</ref>

Because of its distinctive appearance, great bulk and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal, particularly in English children's literature. Perhaps its best known appearance is in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s whimsical poem ''[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]'' that appears in his 1871 book ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. In the poem, the [[eponymous]] [[anti-heroes]] use trickery to consume a great number of [[oyster]]s. Although Carroll accurately portrays the biological walrus's appetite for bivalve mollusks, oysters, primarily [[nearshore]] and [[intertidal]] inhabitants, in fact comprise an insignificant portion of its diet, even in captivity.<ref>

Another appearance of the walrus in literature is in the story ''The White Seal'' in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]], where it is the "''old Sea Vitch—the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is asleep''".<ref>Kipling, Rudyard. (1894) ''The Jungle Book''; (1994) Harmondsworth, England:Penguin Popular Classics, p.84, ISBN 0-14-062104-0</ref>

Walruses also appear in the songs "[[I Am The Walrus]]" and "[[Glass Onion]]" by [[The Beatles]].
