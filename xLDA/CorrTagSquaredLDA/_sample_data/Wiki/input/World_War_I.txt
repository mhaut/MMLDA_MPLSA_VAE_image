'''World War I''' (WWI) or '''First World War''' (called at the time the '''Great War''') was a major war centered on Europe that began in the summer of 1914. The fighting ended in November 1918. This conflict involved all of the world's [[great powers]],<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=10–11}}</ref> assembled in two opposing alliances: the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] (centred around the [[Triple Entente]]) and the [[Central Powers]].<ref name=Willmott15>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=15}}</ref> More than 70&nbsp;million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bade|Brown|2003|pp=167–168}}</ref> More than 9&nbsp;million combatants [[World War I casualties|were killed]], due largely to great technological advances in firepower without corresponding advances in mobility. It was the second [[list of wars and disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=307}}</ref>

The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination on 28 June 1914]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]], was the proximate trigger of the war. Long-term causes, such as [[imperialism|imperialistic]] foreign policies of the great powers of Europe, such as the [[German Empire]], the [[Austria-Hungary#The Great War|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire#Dissolution (1908–1922)|Ottoman Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[British Empire]], France, and [[Italy in World War I#From neutrality to the intervention in the war|Italy]], played a major role. Ferdinand's assassination by a [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalist]] resulted in a [[July Ultimatum|Habsburg ultimatum]] against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].<ref name="AJPT2">{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=80–93}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Djokić|2003|p=24}}</ref> Several alliances formed over the past decades were invoked, so within weeks the major powers were at war; via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world.

On 28 July, the conflict opened with the Austro-Hungarian [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|invasion of Serbia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|2004|p=12}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Martel|2003>p=xii ff}}</ref> followed by the German invasion of [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and France; and a Russian attack against Germany. After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a static battle of attrition with a [[trench warfare|trench line]] that changed little until 1917. In the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|East]], the Russian army successfully fought against the Austro-Hungarian forces but was forced back by the German army. Additional fronts opened after the Ottoman Empire joined the war in 1914, Italy and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] in 1915 and [[Romania]] in 1916. The Russian Empire [[Russian Revolution (1917)|collapsed]] in 1917, and Russia left the war after the [[October Revolution]] later that year. After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, United States forces entered the trenches and the Allies drove back the German armies in a series of successful offensives. Germany agreed to a cease-fire on 11 November 1918, later known as [[Armistice Day]].

By the war's end, four major imperial powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires—had been militarily and politically defeated.  The latter two ceased to exist.<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=6}}</ref> The revolutionised [[Soviet Union]] emerged from the Russian Empire, while the map of central Europe was completely redrawn into numerous smaller states.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=7}}</ref> The [[League of Nations]] was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, and the repercussions of Germany's defeat and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] led to the beginning of [[World War II]] in 1939.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=11}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Before World War II, the war was also known as ''The Great War'', ''The World War'', or ''The War in Europe''.<ref>[http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=great+war%2C+the+war+to+end+war&year_start=1914&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=0 Great War, the war to end war], via Books Ngram Viewer at [[Google Labs]], 1750-2000, English books, 0-smoothing. Retrieved December 16, 2010.</ref> In France and Belgium, it was sometimes referred to as ''La Guerre du Droit'' (''the War for Justice'') or ''La Guerre Pour la Civilisation'' / ''de Oorlog tot de Beschaving'' (''the War to Preserve Civilisation''), especially on medals and commemorative monuments. The term of choice used by official histories of the war in Britain and Canada is ''First World War'', while American histories generally use the term ''World War I''.

The earliest known use of the term ''First World War'' appeared in September 1914 when German biologist and philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]] said, "There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared "European War" ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word."<ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2006|p=329}} citing a wire service report in ''The Indianapolis Star, 20 September 1914''</ref>

The terms ''World War I'' and ''First World War'' both became standard (in the United States and Britain respectively) beginning in about 1940 to 1942; prior to that, it was most commonly called ''The Great War''.<ref>According to data-sets from [[Google Books]] [[Ngram]] Viewer comparing English language books and periodicals published between 1914-2000.

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}
[[File:WWI-re.png|thumb|400px|right|Map of the [[participants in World War I]]: [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in green, [[Central Powers]] in yellow, and neutral countries in grey]]
In the 19th century, the major European powers had gone to great lengths to maintain a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] throughout Europe, resulting by 1900 in a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent.<ref name=Willmott15/> These had started in 1815, with the [[Holy Alliance]] between [[Prussia]], Russia, and Austria. Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between the monarchs of Austria–Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria–Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria–Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]]. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the [[Balkans]] as the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued to weaken.<ref name=Willmott15 /> In 1882, this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].<ref name=keegan52>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|p=52}}</ref>

After 1870, European conflict was averted largely due to a carefully planned network of treaties between the German Empire and the remainder of Europe orchestrated by Chancellor Bismarck. He especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. With the ascension of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] as [[German Emperor]] (''Kaiser''), Bismarck's system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused to renew the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia in 1890. Two years later, the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, the United Kingdom sealed an alliance with France, the [[Entente cordiale]] and in 1907, the United Kingdom and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. This system of interlocking bilateral agreements formed the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name=Willmott15/>

[[File:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H61017.jpg|thumb|alt=Ship at sea with smoke emitting from two funnels|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|''HMS Dreadnought'']]. A naval [[arms race]] existed between the United Kingdom and Germany.]]

German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after [[German unification|unification and the foundation of the empire]] in 1870. From the mid-1890s on, the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources to building up the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial German Navy), established by Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], in rivalry with the British [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.<ref name=willmott21/> As a result, both nations strove to out-build each other in terms of [[capital ships]]. With the launch of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rivals.<ref name=willmott21>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=21}}</ref> The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to the production of the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.<ref>{{harvnb|Prior|1999|p=18}}</ref> Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50&nbsp;percent.<ref name="Fromkin2004">{{harvnb|Fromkin|2004|p=94}}</ref>

Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878. This greatly angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=keegan48-49>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48–49}}</ref> Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in what was known as "the [[Powder keg of Europe]]".<ref name=keegan48-49 />

In 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent [[Albania|Albanian State]] while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], further destabilising the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2–23}}</ref>

[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian-Serb student was arrested immediately after he assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]]]
On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Bosnian-Serb student and member of [[Young Bosnia]], assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.<ref name=Willmott26>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref> This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Wanting to end Serbian interference in Bosnia conclusively, Austria-Hungary delivered the [[July Ultimatum]] to Serbia, a series of ten demands which were intentionally unacceptable, made with the intention of deliberately initiating a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> When Serbia acceded to only eight of the ten demands levied against it in the ultimatum, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914. [[Hew Strachan|Strachan]] argues "Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria-Hungary's behaviour must be doubtful. Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity, and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning".<ref>{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|p=68}}</ref>

The Russian Empire, unwilling to allow Austria–Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its longtime Serb protégés, ordered a partial mobilisation one day later.<ref name=keegan52 /> When the German Empire began to mobilise on 30 July 1914, France, sporting significant animosity over the German conquest of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], ordered French mobilisation on 1 August. Germany declared war on Russia on the same day.<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=29}}</ref> The United Kingdom declared war on Germany, on 4 August 1914, following an "unsatisfactory reply" to the British ultimatum that [[Belgium]] must be kept [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror01_01.shtml |publisher=bbc.co.uk |title= Daily Mirror Headlines: The Declaration of War, Published 4 August 1914 |accessdate= 9 February 2010}}</ref>

==Chronology==
===Opening hostilities===
====Confusion among the Central Powers====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but never tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|pp=292–296, 343–354}}</ref><!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: "Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War" --> Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing the majority of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

On 9 September 1914, the [[Septemberprogramm]], a possible plan which detailed Germany's specific war aims and the conditions that Germany sought to force upon the Allied Powers, was outlined by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]]. It was never officially adopted.

====African campaigns====
[[File:Lettow's surrender.jpg|thumb|Lettow surrendering his forces to the British at Abercorn|alt=A line of African soldiers backs a German officer surrendering to a British officer backed by a similar line of African soldiers.]]
{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}
Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French and German colonial forces in Africa. On 7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]]. On 10 August, German forces in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the remainder of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign for the duration of World War I, only surrendering two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Farwell|1989|p=353}}</ref>

====Serbian campaign====
[[File:Serbian retreat WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian Army during its retreat towards Albania|alt=A column of horse-drawn wagons makes its way along a dirt road up a hill.]]
{{Main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)}}
The Serbian army fought the [[Battle of Cer]] against the invading Austro-Hungarians, beginning on 12 August, occupying defensive positions on the south side of the [[Drina]] and [[Sava]] rivers. Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victory of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory. As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=172}}</ref>

====German forces in Belgium and France====
[[File:German soldiers in a railroad car on the way to the front during early World War I, taken in 1914. Taken from greatwar.nl site.jpg|thumb|alt=Men waving from the door and window of a rail goods van|German soldiers in a railway goods van on the way to the front in 1914. A message on the car spells out "Trip to Paris"; early in the war all sides expected the conflict to be a short one.]]
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
At the outbreak of the First World War, the German army (consisting in the West of [[German Army order of battle (1914)|seven field armies]]) executed a modified version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border.<ref name=AJPT2/> The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris and initially, the Germans were very successful, particularly in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14–24 August). By 12 September, the French with assistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British forces]] halted the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5–12 September). The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west.<ref name=AJPT2/> The French offensive into Germany launched on 7 August with the [[Battle of Mulhouse]] had limited success.

In the east, only one Field Army defended [[East Prussia]] and when Russia attacked in this region it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (17 August&nbsp;– 2 September), but this diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from rail-heads not foreseen by the [[German General Staff]]. The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=376–8}}</ref>

====Asia and the Pacific====
{{Main|Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I}}
New Zealand [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] [[German Samoa]] (later Western Samoa) on 30 August. On 11 September, the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] landed on the island of [[New Britain|Neu Pommern]] (later New Britain), which formed part of [[German New Guinea]]. Japan seized Germany's [[Micronesia]]n colonies and, after the [[Siege of Tsingtao]], the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]] in the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula. Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1968|pp=224–232}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Falls|1960|pp=79–80}}</ref>

===Early stages===
====Trench warfare begins====
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
[[File:WinstonChurchill1916Army.gif|thumb|[[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] with the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]], 1916]]
Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology. These changes resulted in the building of impressive defence systems, which out of date tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances. [[Artillery]], vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine guns]], made crossing open ground very difficult.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=424}}</ref> The Germans introduced [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]]; it soon became used by both sides, though it never proved decisive in winning a battle. Its effects were brutal, causing slow and painful death, and poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties.

In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as the [[tank]].<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421–423}}</ref> Britain and France were its primary users; the Germans employed captured Allied tanks and small numbers of their own design. After the [[First Battle of the Marne]], both [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and German forces began a series of outflanking manoeuvres, in the so-called "[[Race to the Sea]]". Britain and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German forces from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's coast.<ref name=AJPT2/> Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories; consequently, German trenches were generally much better constructed than those of their enemy. Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be "temporary" before their forces broke through German defences.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=199 (footnote)}}</ref> Both sides attempted to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915 at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the Germans (in violation of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]) used [[chlorine]] gas for the first time on the Western Front. Algerian troops retreated when gassed and a six&nbsp;kilometre (four&nbsp;mile) hole opened in the Allied lines that the Germans quickly exploited, taking [[Kitcheners' Wood]]. [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canadian soldiers]] closed the breach at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].<ref>{{harvnb|Love|1996}}</ref> At the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], Canadian and [[ANZAC]] troops took the village of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]].
[[Image:Melbourne recruiting WWI.jpg|thumb|Men in Melbourne collecting recruitment papers]]
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mud stained British soldiers at rest |In the [[trench]]es: [[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a [[Trench warfare#Defensive system|communications]] trench on the [[first day on the Somme]], 1 July 1916.]]
On 1 July 1916, the [[British Army]] endured the bloodiest day in its history, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead on the [[first day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme]]. Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men.<ref>{{harvnb|Duffy}}</ref>

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years, though protracted German action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] throughout 1916,<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1221}}</ref> combined with the bloodletting at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts at frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French ''[[poilu]]'' (infantry) and led to [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|widespread mutinies]], especially during the [[Nivelle Offensive]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=854}}</ref>

Throughout 1915–17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, due both to the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. At the strategic level, while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the Allies made several attempts to break through German lines. At the tactical level, Ludendorff's doctrine of "[[defense in depth|elastic defence]]" was well suited for trench warfare. This defence had a relatively lightly defended forward position and a more powerful main position farther back beyond artillery range, from which an immediate and powerful counter-offensive could be launched.<ref>{{harvnb|Heer|2009|pp=223–4}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=226}}</ref>

Ludendorff wrote on the fighting in 1917, {{quote|The 25th&nbsp;of August concluded the second phase of the Flanders battle. It had cost us heavily&nbsp;... The costly August battles in Flanders and at Verdun imposed a heavy strain on the Western troops. In spite of all the concrete protection they seemed more or less powerless under the enormous weight of the enemy’s artillery. At some points they no longer displayed the firmness which I, in common with the local commanders, had hoped for. The enemy managed to adapt himself to our method of employing counter attacks&nbsp;... I myself was being put to a terrible strain. The state of affairs in the West appeared to prevent the execution of our plans elsewhere. Our wastage had been so high as to cause grave misgivings, and had exceeded all expectation.<ref>{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919|p=480}}</ref>}}

On the battle of the Menin Road Ridge, Ludendorff wrote, {{quote|Another terrific assault was made on our lines on the&nbsp;20 September&nbsp;... The enemy’s onslaught on the 20th was successful, which proved the superiority of the attack over the defence. Its strength did not consist in the tanks; we found them inconvenient, but put them out of action all the same. The power of the attack lay in the artillery, and in the fact that ours did not do enough damage to the hostile infantry as they were assembling, and above all, at the actual time of the assault.<ref name="Terraine-Victory" />}}

Around 1.1 to 1.2 million soldiers from the British and Dominion armies were on the Western Front at any one time.<ref>{{harvnb|Perry|1988|p=27}}</ref> A thousand battalions, occupying sectors of the line from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Orne River (Lorraine)|Orne River]], operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. The front contained over {{convert|9600|km|mi|0}} of trenches. Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out-of-line, often in the [[Poperinge]] or [[Amiens]] areas.

In the 1917 [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]], the only significant British military success was the capture of [[Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]] under [[Sir Arthur Currie]] and [[Julian Byng]]. The assaulting troops were able for the first time to overrun, rapidly reinforce and hold the ridge defending the coal-rich [[Douai]] plain.<ref>{{citation| title=Vimy Ridge, Canadian National Memorial| year=2007| url=http://www.ww1westernfront.gov.au/vimy-ridge/index.html| work=Australians on the Western Front 1914–1918| publisher=New South Wales Department of Veteran's Affairs and Board of Studies}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Winegard}}</ref>

===Naval war===
{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}
[[File:Grand Fleet sails.jpg|thumb|The British [[Grand Fleet]] making steam for [[Scapa Flow]], 1914]]
At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied [[merchant shipping]]. The British [[Royal Navy]] systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser {{SMS|Emden}}, part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, the bulk of the [[German East Asia Squadron|German East-Asia squadron]]—consisting of the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, light cruisers {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}} and {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it encountered elements of the British fleet. The German flotilla, along with {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}}, sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was almost destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the [[Battle of Más a Tierra]] these too were destroyed or interned.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|pp=39–47}}</ref>

[[File:Hochseeflotte 2.jpg|thumb|A battleship squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet|Hochseeflotte]] at sea]]
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.<ref name="isbn0-313-33181-2">{{harvnb|Keene|2006|p=5}}</ref> Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.<ref name="isbn1-85728-498-4">{{harvnb|Halpern|1995|p=293}}</ref> Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.<ref name="isbn0-8476-9645-6">{{harvnb|Zieger|2001|p=50}}</ref>

The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or "Battle of the Skagerrak") developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. It took place on 31 May&nbsp;– 1 June 1916, in the [[North Sea]] off [[Jutland]]. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], squared off against the Royal Navy's [[Grand Fleet]], led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans, outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=619–24}}</ref>

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships entered [[convoy]]s escorted by destroyers. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the introduction of [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charge]]s, accompanying destroyers might attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. The convoy system slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program to build new freighters. Troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/hansard//comm/va/va_2006nov09.htm| title=Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs| accessdate=2007-10-30| work=Hansard}}</ref> The U-boats had sunk almost 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 178 submarines.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.uboat.net/history/wwi/part6.htm| title=The U-boat War in World War One| accessdate=2009-11-12| isbn=1904381367}}</ref>

World War I also saw the first use of [[aircraft carrier]]s in combat, with [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in a successful raid against the [[Zeppelin]] hangars at [[Tondern raid|Tondern]] in July 1918, as well as [[blimp]]s for antisubmarine patrol.<ref>{{harvnb|Price}}</ref>

====War in the Balkans====
{{Main|Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Macedonian front (World War I)}}

[[File:Austrians executing Serbs 1917.JPG|thumb|Austrian troops executing captured Serbians in 1917. Serbia lost about 850,000 people, a quarter of its prewar population, and half its prewar resources.<ref>"[http://international.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0021) The Balkan Wars and World War I]". ''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''.</ref>]]
Faced with Russia, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counter attack in the [[battle of Kolubara]], however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading [[Bulgaria]] to join in attacking Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian provinces of [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] provided troops for Austria-Hungary, invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy. [[Montenegro]] allied itself with Serbia.<ref>{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=54–55}}</ref>

Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month. The attack began in October, when the Central Powers launched an offensive from the north; four days later the Bulgarians joined the attack from the east. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into [[Albania]], halting only once to make a stand against the Bulgarians. The Serbs suffered defeat near modern day [[Gnjilane]] in the [[Battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians conquered Montenegro, too. Serbian forces were evacuated by ship to Greece.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075–6}}</ref>

In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece, to offer assistance and to pressure the government to declare war against the Central Powers. Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro-Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], before the Allied expeditionary force could arrive.<ref>{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=108–10}}</ref>
[[File:Entente on the Balkans.jpg|thumb|alt=Soldiers wearing nine distinct uniforms stand in a circle.|The Entente in Macedonia. From left to right: soldiers from Indochina, France, Senegal, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Serbia, Greece, and India.]]
After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria. Bulgarians commenced Bulgarization of the Serbian population in their occupation zone, banishing [[Serbian Cyrillic]] and the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After forced conscription of the Serbian population into the Bulgarian army{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} in 1917, the [[Toplica (river)#Toplica rebellion|Toplica Uprising]] began. Serbian rebels liberated for a short time the area between the [[Kopaonik]] mountains and the [[South Morava]] river. The uprising was crushed by joint efforts of Bulgarian and Austrian forces at the end of March 1917.

The Macedonian Front proved static for the most part. Serbian forces retook part of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916. Only at the end of the conflict were the Entente powers able to break through, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]] but days later, they decisively defeated British and Greek forces at the [[Battle of Doiran]], avoiding occupation. Bulgaria signed an armistice on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref> Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the [[Central Powers]] and a day after the Bulgarian collapse, during a meeting with government officials, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.<ref name=Doughty>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vZRmHkdGk44C&pg=PA247&dq=vardar+offensive&hl=bg&ei=y9qoTN6GO8KSjAeS2tG9DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=vardar%20offensive&f=false  |title=Pyrrhic victory: French strategy and operations in the Great War|first=Robert A.

The disappearance of the [[Macedonian front]] meant that the road to [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] was now opened for the 670,000-strong army of general [[Franchet d'Esperey]] as the Bulgarian capitulation deprived the [[Central Powers]] of the 278 infantry battalions and 1,500 guns (the equivalent of some 25 to 30 German divisions) that were previously holding the line.<ref name=militera/> The German high command was able to respond by sending in only seven infantry and one cavalry division but these forces were far from sufficient for a front to be reestablished.<ref name=militera>{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/korsun_ng4/06.html  |title=The Balkan Front of the World War (in Russian)|first=N.Korsun|publisher=militera.lib.ru|accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in the war, the secret [[Ottoman-German Alliance]] having been signed in August 1914.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/turkgerm.asp The Treaty of Alliance Between Germany and Turkey] 2 August 1914, Yale University</ref> It threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with India via the [[Suez Canal]]. The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s. In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the disastrous [[Siege of Kut]] (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. Further to the west, in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]], initial British setbacks were overcome when they captured [[Jerusalem]] in December 1917. The [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], under Field Marshal [[Edmund Allenby]], broke the Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918.

[[File:Sarikam.jpg|thumb|Russian forest trench at the Battle of Sarikamish]]
Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central Asia, and areas that had been lost to Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.<ref name="isbn0-8050-6884-8">{{harvnb|Fromkin|2001|p=119}}</ref> He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops; insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter, he lost 86% of his force at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]].<ref name=caven>{{harvnb|Hinterhoff|1984|pp=499–503}}</ref>

General [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]], the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.<ref name=caven />
In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from [[Georgia (country)|Russian Georgia]] to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917, (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar was overthrown in the [[February Revolution]] and the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart.

The army corps of [[Armenian volunteer units]] realigned under the command of General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]], with [[Drastamat Kanayan|Dro]] as a civilian commissioner of the [[Administration for Western Armenia]]. The front line had three main divisions commanded by [[Movses Silikyan]], [[Andranik Toros Ozanian|Andranik]], and [[Mikhail Areshian]]. Another regular unit was under Colonel Korganian. More than 40,000 men in Armenian [[Armenian irregular units|partisan guerrilla detachments]] accompanied the main units.<ref>[[Boghos Nubar]], the president of the "[[Armenian National Assembly (Ottoman Empire)|Armenian National Assembly]]", declared to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] through a letter to French Foreign Office&nbsp;– 3 December 1918</ref>

Instigated by the Arab bureau of the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], the [[Arab Revolt]] started with the help of Britain in June 1916 at the [[Battle of Mecca 1916|Battle of Mecca]], led by [[Sherif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]], the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]], resisted for more than two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sachar|pp=122–138}}</ref>

Along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, the [[Senussi]] tribe, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to deal with the Senussi. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|1994}}</ref>

====Italian participation====
{{Main|Italian Campaign (World War I)}}
{{See|Battles of the Isonzo}}
[[File:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|upright|Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol]]
Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Province of Trento|Trentino]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.<ref>{{harvnb|Page}}</ref> At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature, and that Austria–Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of [[Tunisia]] in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the [[Trentino-Alto Adige|Southern Tyrol]], [[Julian March]] and territory on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]]. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany.

Militarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. This advantage, however, was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening [[Vienna]]. It was a [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] plan, which had no realistic chance of success in an age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and mountainous terrain.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaiserschützen]] and [[:de:Standschützen|Standschützen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counter attacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916, (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress.

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[Soča|Isonzo front]] along the [[Soča|Isonzo River]], north east of [[Trieste]]. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austro-Hungarian troops received large numbers of reinforcements, including German [[Stormtrooper]]s and the elite [[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]. The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]]. The Italian army was routed and retreated more than 100&nbsp;kilometres (60&nbsp;mi.) to reorganise, stabilising the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since in the Battle of Caporetto the Italian Army had heavy losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so-called '''99 Boys'' (Ragazzi del '99), that is, all males who were 18 years old. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through, in a series of battles on the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]] and, finally being decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October of that year. Austria-Hungary surrendered in early November 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Hickey|2003|pp=60–65}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|2005|pp=585–9}}</ref>

====Romanian participation====
{{Main|Romania during World War I}}
[[Image:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops]]
[[Romania]] had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. When the Entente Powers promised Romania large territories of eastern Hungary ([[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]]), that had a large Romanian population, in exchange for Romania’s declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality, and on 27 August 1916 the Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|launched an attack]] against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, pushing back the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counter attack by the forces of the [[Central Powers]] drove back the Russo-Romanian forces and as a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]] the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova [[Romanian Campaign#Stabilization and stalemate (1917)|continued in 1917]], resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers.<ref>http://www.worldwar2.ro/primulrazboi/?language=en&article=116</ref><ref>Cyril Falls, ''The Great War'', p. 285</ref> As Russia withdrew from the war in late 1917 as a result of the [[October Revolution]], Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917.

In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over [[Bessarabia]] as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and the [[Bolshevik]] Russian government following talks between 5–9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania attached Bessarabia to its territory, formally based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of the territory on the unification with Romania.

Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 7 May 1918. Under that treaty Romania was obliged to cease war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions for Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and grant oil concessions for Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over [[Bessarabia]]. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of [[Compiègne]].<ref>{{citation| last=Béla| first=Köpeczi| title=Erdély története| publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó| url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/571.html}}</ref><ref>{{citation| last=Béla| first=Köpeczi| title=History of Transylvania| publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó| url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/429.html| isbn=848371020X}}</ref> Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.<ref>{{Citation

====The role of India====
{{Further|[[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]|[[Hindu-German Conspiracy]]}}
The war began with an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=197–198}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=201–203}}</ref> The [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war. India under British rule contributed greatly to the British war effort by providing men and resources. This was done by the Indian Congress in hope of achieving self-government as India was very much under the control of the British. The United Kingdom disappointed the Indians by not providing self-governance, leading to the [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhian]] Era in Indian history. About 1.3&nbsp;million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all 140,000&nbsp;men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm| title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War| publisher=Memorial Gates Trust| accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>

===Eastern Front===
====Initial actions====
{{Main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}
While the Western Front had reached stalemate, the war continued in East Europe. Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and German East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, they were driven back from East Prussia by [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|2005|p=715}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2006|pp=152–4, 161, 163, 175, 182}}</ref> Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded.

[[File:Lenin.WWI.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A man in a business suit holds up his right hand with palm open.|[[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Illyich Lenin]]]]
Despite the success of the June 1916 [[Brusilov Offensive]] in eastern [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Schindler|2003}}</ref> dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew. The success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily with [[Romania]]'s entry into the war on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in [[Transylvania]] and [[Bucharest]] fell to the Central Powers on 6 December. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] remained at the front. [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra's]] increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. The army became increasingly ineffective.<ref name="Smele" />

The war and the government became increasingly unpopular. Discontent led to a rise in popularity of the [[Bolshevik]] party, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. He promised to pull Russia out of the war and was able to gain power. The [[October Revolution|triumph of the Bolsheviks]] in November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when Germany resumed the war and marched across [[Ukraine]] with impunity, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. It took Russia out of the war and ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and [[Ukraine]] to the Central Powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Bennett|1956}}</ref> The manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive, however, and secured relatively little food or other [[materiel]]<!--this is correct term for war supplies; "war" is thus a redundant word here-->

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a small-scale invasion]] of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the "Whites" (as opposed to "Reds") in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mawdsley|2008|pp=54–55}}</ref> Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] and in [[Vladivostok]].

===Central Powers proposal for starting peace negotiations===
[[File:Franz Stassen - WWI - An das deutsche Volk.png|thumb|1917 German poster: Wilhelm II blames the Allies for fighting on.]]

In December 1916, after ten brutal months of the [[Battle of Verdun]] and a [[Romanian_Campaign_(World_War_I)#The_counteroffensive_of_the_Central_Powers_.28September.E2.80.93December_1916.29|successful offensive against Romania]], the Germans attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies. Soon after, U.S. President Wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German offer as a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the U.S. was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united Poland". On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.<ref>{{harvnb|Kernek|1970|pp=721–766}}</ref> The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer, because Germany did not state any specific proposals. To Wilson the Entente powers stated, that they will not start peace negotiations until the Central powers evacuated all occupied Allied territories and provided indemnities for all damage which was done.<ref> Stracham (1998), p. 61</ref>

====Developments in 1917====
Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.

The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became extremely effective in reducing the [[U-boat]] threat. Britain was safe from starvation and German industrial output fell.

On 3 May 1917, during the [[Nivelle Offensive]], the weary French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused their orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. Then, [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] afflicted an additional 54 French divisions and saw 20,000 men desert. The other Allied forces attacked but sustained tremendous casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|Lyons|1999|p=243}}</ref> However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe Pétain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.

[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'écluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]

The victory of Austria–Hungary and Germany at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] led the Allies at the [[Rapallo Conference]] to form the [[Supreme War Council]] to coordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia. This released large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.<ref name="isbn0-313-29880-7">{{harvnb|Heyman|1997|pp=146–147}}</ref>

====Entry of the United States====
{{Main|American entry into World War I}}

=====Non-Intervention=====
The United States originally pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When a German U-boat sank the British liner [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] vowed, "America is too proud to fight" and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law and U.S. ideas of human rights. Wilson was under pressure from former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who denounced German acts as "piracy".<ref>{{harvnb|Brands|1997|p=756}}</ref> Wilson's desire to have a seat at negotiations at war's end to advance the [[League of Nations]] also played a role.<ref name = "Karp-PoW-1979">{{harvnb|Karp|1979}}</ref> Wilson's Secretary of State, [[William Jennings Bryan]], whose opinions had been ignored, resigned as he could no longer support the president's policy. Public opinion was angered at suspected German sabotage of [[Black Tom explosion|Black Tom]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], and the [[Kingsland Explosion]].

In January 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. The German Foreign minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], told Mexico that U.S. entry was likely once unrestricted submarine warfare began, and invited [[Mexico]] to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would send Mexico money and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona that Mexico lost during the [[Mexican-American War]] 70&nbsp;years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuchman|1966}}</ref>  Wilson released the Zimmerman note to the public and Americans saw it as a casus bellum--a cause for war.

=====First active U.S. participation=====
[[Image:Piave Front 1918.JPEG|thumb|American soldiers on the Piave front hurling a shower of hand grenades into the Austrian trenches]]
[[File:At close grips2.jpg|right|thumb|Two American soldiers run towards a bunker.]]
The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled "Associated Power". The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8 million men<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |title=Selective Service System: History and Records |publisher=Sss.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> and by summer 1918 was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the U.S. Congress gave U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act|Jones Act]]. Germany had miscalculated, believing it would be many more months before they would arrive and that the arrival could be stopped by U-boats.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilgus|p=52}}</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the British Grand Fleet, [[destroyers]] to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], Ireland and [[submarines]] to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[U.S. Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted U.S. units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. The U.S. rejected the first proposition and accepted the second. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up U.S. units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, earning a unit [[Croix de guerre]] for their actions at Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood and Sechault.<ref>{{citation| publisher=U.S. [[National Archives and Records Administration]]|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/| title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I| accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref><!--

====Austrian offer of separate peace====
In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, with his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, a diplomatic catastrophe.<ref>{{harvnb|Kurlander|2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shanafelt|1985|pp=125–30}}</ref>

====German Spring Offensive of 1918====
{{Main|Spring Offensive}}
German General [[Erich Ludendorff]] drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow before significant U.S. forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Amiens]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60&nbsp;kilometres (40&nbsp;miles).<ref>{{harvnb|Westwell|2004}}</ref>

British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics, after General [[Oskar von Hutier]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive of 1918, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.<ref>{{harvnb|Posen|1984|pp=190&191}}</ref>

The front moved to within 120&nbsp;kilometres (75&nbsp;mi) of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. This situation was not helped by the supply lines now being stretched as a result of their advance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|1991|p=86}}</ref> The sudden stop was also a result of the four [[Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) divisions that were "rushed" down, thus doing what no other army had done and stopping the German advance in its tracks. During that time the first Australian division was hurriedly sent north again to stop the second German breakthrough.

[[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements. Pershing sought instead to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the [[Doullens Conference]] on 5 November 1917.<ref name=moon/> General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. Haig, Petain and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a coordinating role, rather than a directing role and the British, French and U.S. commands operated largely independently.<ref name=moon>{{harvnb|Moon|1996|pp=495–196}}</ref>

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive with limited territorial gains for Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Blücher and Yorck]], broadly towards Paris. Operation Marne was launched on 15 July, attempting to encircle [[Reims]] and beginning the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. The resulting counterattack, starting the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked their first successful Allied offensive of the war.

By 20 July the Germans were back across the Marne at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines,<ref>{{harvnb|Rickard|2007}}</ref> having achieved nothing. Following this last phase of the war in the West, the German Army never again regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was 53&nbsp;percent of 1913 levels.

====New states under war zone====
In 1918, the internationally recognized [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] bordering the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire were established, as well as the unrecognized [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]]. Later, these unrecognized states were eliminated by Azerbaijan and Turkey. {{further|[[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]}}

In 1918, the [[Dashnak]]s of the [[Armenian national movement|Armenian national liberation movement]] declared the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] (DRA) through the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians]] (unified form of [[Armenian National Council]]s) after the dissolution of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] became the first Commander-in-chief of the DRA. Enver Pasha ordered the creation of a new army to be named the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]]. He ordered the Army of Islam into the DRA, with the goal of taking [[Baku]] on the [[Caspian Sea]]. This new offensive was strongly opposed by the [[German Empire|Germans]]. In early May 1918, the Ottoman army attacked the newly declared DRA. Although the Armenians managed to inflict one defeat on the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]], the Ottoman army won a later battle and scattered the Armenian army. The Republic of Armenia signed the [[Treaty of Batum]] in June 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Swietochowski|2004}}</ref>

====Allied victory: summer and autumn 1918====
{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Weimar Republic}}

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918. The [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] developed with III Corps [[British Fourth Army]] on the left, the [[French First Army]] on the right, and the [[Australian Corps|Australian]] and [[Canadian Corps]] spearheading the offensive in the centre through [[Harbonnières]].<ref name="AWMAmiens">{{citation| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiens.htm|title=The Battle of Amiens: 8 August 1918| publisher=Australian War Memorial| accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiensmap.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070617055415/http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiensmap.htm |archivedate=2007-06-17 |title=Amiens Map |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=2009-10-24}} (archived 2007-06-17)</ref> It involved 414 [[tank]]s of the [[Mark I (tank)|Mark IV]] and [[Mark V (tank)#Mark V series|Mark V]] type, and 120,000 men. They advanced 12&nbsp;kilometres (7&nbsp;miles) into German-held territory in just seven hours. Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".<ref name="AWMAmiens" /><ref>{{harvnb|Rickard|2001}}</ref>

The Australian-Canadian spearhead at Amiens, a battle that was the beginning of Germany’s downfall,<ref name="Terraine-Victory">{{harvnb|Terraine|1963}}</ref> helped pull the British armies to the north and the French armies to the south forward. While German resistance on the British Fourth Army front at Amiens stiffened, after an advance as far as {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} and concluded the battle there, the French Third Army lengthened the Amiens front on 10&nbsp;August, when it was thrown in on the right of the French First Army, and advanced {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} liberating Lassigny in fighting which lasted until 16&nbsp;August. South of the French Third Army, General [[Charles Mangin]] (The Butcher) drove his French Tenth Army forward at Soissons on 20 August to capture eight thousand prisoners, two hundred guns and the Aisne heights overlooking and menacing the German position north of the Vesle.<ref name="Pitt-1918">{{harvnb|Pitt|2003}}</ref> Another "Black day" as described by Erich Ludendorff.

Meanwhile General Byng of the Third British Army, reporting that the enemy on his front was thinning in a limited withdrawal, was ordered to attack with 200 tanks towards Bapaume, opening the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]], with the specific orders of "To break the enemy's front, in order to outflank the enemies present battle front" (opposite the British Fourth Army at Amiens).<ref name="Terraine-Victory"/> Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. Attacks were being undertaken in quick order to take advantage of the successful advances on the flanks and then broken off when that attack lost its initial impetus.<ref name="Pitt-1918" />

The British Third Army's {{convert|15|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front north of Albert progressed after stalling for a day against the main resistance line to which the enemy had withdrawn.<ref>{{harvnb|Maurice|1918}}</ref> Rawlinson’s Fourth British Army was able to battle its left flank forward between Albert and the Somme straightening the line between the advanced positions of the Third Army and the Amiens front which resulted in recapturing Albert at the same time.<ref name="Pitt-1918" /> On 26&nbsp;August the British First Army on the left of the Third Army was drawn into the battle extending it northward to beyond Arras. The Canadian Corps already being back in the vanguard of the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] fought their way from Arras eastward {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} astride the heavily defended Arras-Cambrai before reaching the outer defences of the [[Hindenburg Line]], breaching them on the 28 and 29&nbsp;August. Bapaume fell on the 29&nbsp;August to the New Zealand Division of the Third Army and the Australians, still leading the advance of the Fourth Army, were again able to push forward at Amiens to take Peronne and [[Mont Saint-Quentin]] on 31&nbsp;August. Further south the French First and Third Armies had slowly fought forward while the Tenth Army, who had by now crossed the Ailette and was east of the Chemin des Dames, was now near to the Alberich position of the Hindenburg Line.<ref name="Chron-FWW">{{harvnb|Gray|Argyle|1990}}</ref> During the last week of August the pressure along a {{convert|70|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."<ref name="Pitt-1918" /> Even to the north in [[Flanders]] the British Second and Fifth Armies during August and September were able to make progress taking prisoners and positions that were previously denied them.<ref name="Chron-FWW"/>

[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|left|upright|Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an [[observation balloon]] flying over territory near front lines]]On 2 September the [[Canadian Corps]] outflanking of the Hindenburg line, with the breaching of the Wotan Position, made it possible for the Third Army to advance and sent repercussions all along the Western Front. That same day [[Oberste Heeresleitung]] (OHL) had no choice but to issue orders to six armies for withdrawal back into the Hindenburg Line in the south, behind the [[Canal du Nord]] on the Canadian-First Army's front and back to a line east of the Lys in the north, giving up without a fight the salient seized in the previous April.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson|1962}}</ref> According to [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] “We had to admit the necessity&nbsp;... to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.”<ref name="Ludendorff">{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919}}</ref>

In nearly four weeks of fighting since 8&nbsp;August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] and the rest by the French. Since "The Black Day of the German Army" the German High Command realised the war was lost and made attempts for a satisfactory end. The day after the battle Ludenforff told Colonel Mertz "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." On 11&nbsp;August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it and replied, "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended." On 13 August at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Chancellor and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and on the following day the German Crown Council decided victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations, to which the Kaiser responded by instructing Hintz to seek the mediation of the Queen of the Netherlands. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier." On 10&nbsp;September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On the 14&nbsp;September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil and on 15&nbsp;September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected and on 24&nbsp;September [[Oberste Heeresleitung|OHL]] informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.<ref name="Chron-FWW"/>

September saw the Germans continuing to fight strong rear guard actions and launching numerous counter attacks on lost positions, with only a few succeeding and then only temporarily. Contested towns, villages, heights and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the Hindenburg Line continued to fall to the Allies, with the BEF alone taking 30,441&nbsp;prisoners in the last week of September. Further small advances eastward would follow the Third Army victory at Ivincourt on 12&nbsp;September, the Fourth Armies at Epheny on 18&nbsp;September and the French gain of [[Essigny-le-Grand]] a day later. On 24&nbsp;September a final assault by both the British and French on a 4&nbsp;mile (6&nbsp;km) front would come within 2&nbsp;miles (3&nbsp;km) of St. Quentin.<ref name="Chron-FWW"/> With the outposts and preliminary defensive lines of the Siegfried and Alberich Positions eliminated the Germans were now completely back in the Hindenburg Line. With the Wotan position of that line already breached and the Siegfried position in danger of being turned from the north the time had now come for an assault on the whole length of the line.

The Allied [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|attack on the Hindenburg Line]] began on 26&nbsp;September including U.S. soldiers. The still-green American troops suffered problems coping with supply trains for large units on a difficult landscape.<ref>{{harvnb|Jenkins|2009|p=215}}</ref> The following week cooperating French and American units broke through in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] at the [[Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge]], forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.<ref>{{harvnb|McLellan|p=49}}</ref> The last Belgian town to be liberated before the armistice was Ghent, which the Germans held as a pivot until Allied artillery was brought up.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibbs|1918b}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gibbs|1918a}}</ref> The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions.

When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29&nbsp;September, the Allies gained control of Serbia and Greece. Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=380}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hull|2006|pp=307–10}}</ref>

Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy. Knowing the government of [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at [[Kiel]]. Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be suicidal. Ludendorff took the blame—the Kaiser dismissed him on 26&nbsp;October. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. The reserves had been used up, but U.S. troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=383}}</ref>

Having suffered over 6&nbsp;million casualties, Germany moved towards peace. [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Telegraphic negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the vain hope that better terms would be offered than by the British and French. Instead Wilson demanded the abdication of the Kaiser. There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic|social democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9&nbsp;November declared Germany to be a republic. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born: the Weimar Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|ch=17}}</ref>

===Armistices and capitulations===
[[File:Armisticetrain.jpg|thumb|In the forest of [[Compiègne]] after agreeing to the armistice that ended the war, [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] is seen second from the right. The carriage seen in the background, where the armistice was signed, later was chosen as the symbolic setting of Pétain's June 1940 armistice. It was moved to Berlin as a prize, but due to Allied bombing it was eventually moved to [[Crawinkel]], [[Thuringia]], where it was deliberately destroyed by [[SS]] troops in 1945.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.compiegne.fr/decouvrir/clairierearmistice.asp| title=Clairière de l'Armistice| publisher=Ville de [[Compiègne]]| language=French| accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref>]]
The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice on 29 September 1918 at [[Saloniki]].<ref name = "indiana.edu-1918">{{cite web| url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1918.htm| work=League of Nations Photo Archive| title=1918 Timeline| accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> On 30 October the [[Ottoman Empire]] capitulated at [[Moudros]].<ref name = "indiana.edu-1918"/>

On 24 October the Italians began a push which rapidly recovered territory lost after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. This culminated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice. But the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine and Trieste. On 3 November Austria–Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[Armistice]]. The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian Commander and accepted. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|Armistice with Austria]] was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

Following the outbreak of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]], a republic was proclaimed on 9 November. The [[Kaiser]] fled to the Netherlands. On 11 November an [[armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at [[Compiègne]]. At 11 a.m. on 11 November 1918; "the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"; a ceasefire came into effect. Opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions. Canadian Private [[George Lawrence Price]] is traditionally regarded as the last soldier killed in the Great War: he was shot by a German sniper at 10:57 and died at 10:58.<ref>{{citation| last=Lindsay| first=Robert| url=http://www.nwbattalion.com/last.html| title=The Last Hours| work=28th (Northwest) Battalion Headquarters| accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

====Allied superiority and the stab-in-the-back legend, November 1918====
In November 1918 the Allies had ample supplies of men and [[materiel]] to invade Germany, yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied soldier had set foot on German soil in anger and Berlin was still almost {{convert|900|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the Western Front. The Kaiser's armies had also retreated from the battlefield in good order which enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]]<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chickering|2004|pp=185–188}}</ref> which attributed Germany's losing the war not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the intentional sabotaging of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists and Bolsheviks.

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. Later treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the [[Turkish War of Independence]]) and a final peace treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]], at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]] on 24 July 1923.

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles treaty was signed in 1919; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally the last formal peace treaties were not signed until the Treaty of Lausanne. Under its terms, the Allied forces divested [[Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

==Technology==
{{See also|Technology during World War I|Weapons of World War I}}

[[File:Armoured car.jpg|thumb|Armoured cars]]
The First World War began as a clash of 20-century [[technology]] and 19th-century [[military tactics|tactics]], with inevitably large casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|p=154}}</ref> [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tanks]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=82–86}}</ref> and [[aircraft]]. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100 man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre. Instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. Artillery also underwent a revolution.

In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]]. [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilising heavy indirect fire. She employed 150 and 210&nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s in 1914 when the typical French and British guns were only 75 and 105&nbsp;mm. The British had a 6&nbsp;inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. Germans also fielded Austrian 305&nbsp;mm and 420&nbsp;mm guns, and already by the beginning of the war had inventories of various calibers of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'' ideally suited for trench warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Mosier|2001|pp=42–48}}</ref>

Much of the combat involved [[trench warfare]], where hundreds often died for each yard gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. Such battles include [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] was employed to provide the German forces with a constant supply of gunpowder, in the face of British naval blockade.<ref>{{harvnb|Harcup|1988}}</ref> Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|p=421}}</ref> and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head-wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel [[helmet]], led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and U.S. troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

|}
The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Few war casualties were caused by gas,<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens}}</ref> as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] were both outlawed by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|1907 Hague Conventions]], and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|1984}}</ref> though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future "gas wars" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>

The most powerful land-based weapons were [[railway gun]]s weighing hundreds of tons apiece. These were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over 100&nbsp;kilometres (60&nbsp;mi), though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb). While the Allies had railway guns, German models severely out-ranged and out-classed them.

[[File:Sopwith F-1 Camel.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Sopwith Camel]]]]
[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914 the military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bombers]] were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.<ref name="Cross 1991">{{harvnb|Cross|1991}}</ref> Towards the end of the conflict, [[aircraft carrier]]s were used for the first time, with [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in [[Tondern raid|a raid]] to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|1991|pp=56–57}}</ref>

German [[U-boat]]s ([[submarines]]) were deployed after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, they were employed by the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] in a strategy to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), [[hydrophone]]s (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[Hunter-killer armored-vehicle team|hunter-killer]] submarines ([[British R class submarine|HMS ''R&-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref>{{harvnb|Price|1980}}</ref> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the [[interwar period]] until World War II revived the need.

[[File:Vickers IWW.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]]]]
[[File:Old england first.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old England first, 1916]]
Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability became an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds and showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Light [[Automatic firearm|automatic weapons]] also were introduced, such as the [[Lewis Gun]] and [[Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]].

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|1983}}</ref> If there was an enemy air attack, the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output) and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb|Johnson|2001}}</ref> Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft.

[[File:Nieuport w Le Prieur rockets.jpg|thumb|left|Johnson's Nieuport 11 armed with [[Le Prieur rocket]]s for attacking observation balloons.]]To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were even tried. Blimps and balloons contributed to air-to-air combat among aircraft, because of their reconnaissance value, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines. The resulting panic took several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name="Cross 1991"/><ref name=FullCircle />

Another new weapon, [[flamethrower]]s, were first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, they were a powerful, demoralising weapon and caused terror on the battlefield. It was a dangerous weapon to wield, as its heavy weight made operators vulnerable targets.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for wheeled vehicles eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

{{Main|Ottoman casualties of World War I}}
{{See also|Armenian Genocide|Assyrian Genocide|Greek genocide|Genocide denial}}
The [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Ottoman Empire's Christian population, with the most prominent among them being the deportation and massacres of [[Armenians]] (similar policies were enacted against the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Ottoman Greeks]]) during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered [[genocide]].<ref name="IAGSletter">{{cite web| url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/TurkishPMIAGSOpenLetterreArmenia6-13-05.htm| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071006024502/http://www.genocidewatch.org/TurkishPMIAGSOpenLetterreArmenia6-13-05.htm| archivedate=2007-10-06| author=[[International Association of Genocide Scholars]]| title=Open Letter to the Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan| date=13 June 2005| publisher=[[Genocide Watch]] (via archive.org)}}</ref> The Ottomans saw the entire Armenian population as an [[Fifth column|enemy]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lewy|2005|p=57}}</ref> that had chosen to side with Russia at the beginning of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|2006|p=177}}</ref> In early 1915, a number of Armenian nationalist groups, such as the [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party|Armenakan]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] and [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hunchak]] organisations, joined the Russian forces, and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the [[Tehcir Law]]. This authorised the deportation of the Armenians from eastern Anatolia to Syria between 1915 and 1917. The exact number of deaths is unknown, although Balakian gives a range of 250,000 to 1.5 million for the deaths of Armenians,<ref>{{harvnb|Balakian|2003|pp=195–196}}</ref> the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] estimates over 1 million.<ref name="IAGSletter" /> The government of Turkey has consistently [[Armenian Genocide denial|rejected charges of genocide]], arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine or disease during the First World War.<ref>{{harvnb|Fromkin|1989|pp=212–215}}</ref>

===Rape of Belgium===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
In Belgium, German troops, in fear of French and Belgian guerrilla fighters, or ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', massacred townspeople in [[Andenne]] (211 dead), [[Tamines]] (384 dead), and [[Dinant]] (612 dead). On 25 August 1914, the Germans set fire to the town of [[Leuven]], burned the library containing about 230,000 books, killed 209 civilians and forced 42,000 to evacuate. These actions brought worldwide condemnation.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=82–83}}</ref>

The soldiers of the war were initially volunteers, except for Italy, but increasingly were [[conscription|conscripted]] into service. Britain's [[Imperial War Museum]] has collected more than 2,500&nbsp;recordings of soldiers' personal accounts and selected transcripts, edited by military author [[Max Arthur]], have been published. The museum believes that historians have not taken full account of this material and accordingly has made the full archive of recordings available to authors and researchers.<ref>{{citation| last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Forgotten Voices of the Great War| work=| publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]|date=| url=http://www.forgottenvoices.co.uk/| format=| doi=| accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref> Surviving veterans, returning home, often found that they could only discuss their experiences amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed "veterans' associations" or "Legions".

===Prisoners of war===
[[File:Indian army soldier after siege of Kut q79446.jpg|thumb|upright|This photograph shows an emaciated Indian Army soldier who survived the [[Siege of Kut]].]]
About 8 million men surrendered and were held in [[Pow camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the Hague Convention on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]]. A POW's rate of survival was generally much higher than their peers at the front.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillimore|Bellot|1919|pp=4–64}}</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon. Large units usually surrendered en masse. At the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] 92,000&nbsp;Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000&nbsp;Russians became prisoners. Over half of Russian losses were prisoners (as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed); for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.-3.5{{clarify|2-point-what? Does this mean 2.5-3.5? Or 2 million to 3.5?|date=October 2010}} million men as prisoners.) From the Central Powers about 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|pp=368–9}}</ref>

Germany held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.9&nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just prior to the Armistice. The U.S. held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.<ref>{{harvnb|Blair|2005}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cook|2006|pp=637&-665}}</ref> Once prisoners reached a camp, in general, conditions were satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations. Conditions were terrible in Russia, [[starvation]] was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died. In Germany food was scarce, but only 5% died.<ref>{{harvnb|Speed|1990}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|ch=13}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1992}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly.<ref name="isbn0-691-09278-8">{{harvnb|Bass|2002|p=107}}</ref> Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the [[Siege of Kut]], in [[Mesopotamia]], in April 1916, 4,250 died in captivity.<ref>{{citation |publisher=British National Archives |title=The Mesopotamia campaign |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/battles/mesopotamia.htm |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>
Although many were in very bad condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march {{convert|1100|km|mi|0|sing=off}} to [[Anatolia]]. A survivor said: "we were driven along like beasts, to drop out was to die."<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/stolenyears/ww1/turkey/story2.asp| publisher=Australian War Memorial|work=Stolen Years: Australian Prisoners of War| title=Prisoners of Turkey: Men of Kut ''Driven along like beasts''| accessdate=2008-12-10 }}</ref> The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the [[Taurus Mountains]].

In Russia, where the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917 they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of which had to serve as [[forced labor]], e.g. in France until 1920. They were only released after many approaches by the Red Cross to the [[Allied Supreme Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQGQ |title=ICRC in WWI: overview of activities |publisher=Icrc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> There were still German prisoners being held in Russia as late as 1924.<ref>{{cite news|author=Monday, Sep. 01, 1924 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,768983,00.html |title=GERMANY: Notes, Sep. 1, 1924 |publisher=Time.com |date=1924-09-01 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

===Military attachés and war correspondents===
{{Main|Military attachés and war correspondents in the First World War}}
Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern  "[[embedded journalist|embedded]]" positions within the opposing land and naval forces. These military attachés and other observers prepared voluminous first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers.

For example, former U.S. Army Captain [[Granville Roland Fortescue|Granville Fortescue]] followed the developments of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] from an embedded perspective within the ranks of the Turkish defenders; and his report was passed through Turkish censors before being printed in London and New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Fortescue|28 October 1915|p=1}}</ref> However, this observer's role was abandoned when the U.S. entered the war, as Fortescue immediately re-enlisted, sustaining wounds at [[Forest of Argonne]] in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], September 1918.<ref>{{citation| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/fortesc.htm| title=Granville Roland Fortescue| accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>

In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This was not the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] had been closely observed by Military attachés, war correspondents and other observers; but, from a 21st century perspective, it is now apparent that a range of tactical lessons were disregarded or not used in the preparations for war in Europe and throughout the Great War.<ref name="sizemore1">{{harvnb|Sisemore|2003}}</ref>

==Support and opposition to the war==
{{Main|Opposition to World War I|French Army Mutinies (1917)}}

===Support===
The war was primarily supported by nationalists, industrial producers, and imperialists.

In the Balkans, [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalists]] such as Yugoslav nationalist leader [[Ante Trumbić]] in the [[Balkans]] strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of [[Yugoslavs]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=autogenerated4>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1189}}</ref> The [[Yugoslav Committee]] was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London, Trumbić led the Committee.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

In the Middle East, [[Arab nationalism]] soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] state.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=117}}</ref> In 1916, the [[Arab Revolt]] began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

[[Italian nationalism]] was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] who promoted Italian [[irredentism]] and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=335}}</ref> The [[Italian Liberal Party (historical)|Italian Liberal Party]] under the leadership of [[Paolo Boselli]] promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and utilised the [[Dante Aligheri Society]] to promote Italian nationalism.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=219}}</ref>

A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1001}}</ref> Initially European socialists became split on national lines with the conception of [[class conflict]] held by radical socialists such as Marxists and [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] being overstepped by their support for war.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1069}}</ref> Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their country's intervention in the war.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=884}}</ref>

Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it, some were militant supporters of the war including [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Leonida Bissolati]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=209}}</ref> However the [[Italian Socialist Party]] decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a [[general strike]] called [[Red Week]].<ref name=autogenerated6>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=596}}</ref> The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> Mussolini, a [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and the ''Fasci Riviluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista'' ("Revolutionary [[Fasci]] for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the ''[[Fasci di Combattimento]]'' in 1919 and the origin of fascism.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=826}}</ref> Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies to create ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.<ref>Dennis Mack Smith. 1997. ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. Pp. 284.</ref>

In April 1918 the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities was held that included [[Czechoslovak]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Transylvanian]], and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] representatives that urged the Allies to support national [[self-determination]] for the peoples residing within [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />

===Opposition===

[[File:1917 - Execution à Verdun lors des mutineries.jpg|thumb|1917&nbsp;– Execution at Verdun at the time of the mutinies.]]
The [[trade union]] and socialist movements had long voiced their opposition to a war, which they argued, meant only that workers would kill other workers in the interest of capitalism. Once war was declared, however, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolshevik]]s, the [[Socialist Party of America]], and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], and individuals such as [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and their followers in Germany. There were also small anti-war groups in Britain and France.

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the U.S., the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] effectively made free speech illegal and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic. The [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made any statements deemed "disloyal" a federal crime. Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors.<ref name = "Karp-PoW-1979"/>

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists held hostility to. [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] staunchly opposed taking part in intervention with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=autogenerated5>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=584}}</ref> The war had begun amid the Home Rule crisis in [[Ireland]] that had begun in 1912 and by 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of [[civil war]] in Ireland between Irish unionists and republicans.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland in order to stir unrest in the United Kingdom.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> The UK government placed Ireland under [[martial law]] in response to the Easter Rising.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=586}}</ref>

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s&nbsp;– some socialist, some religious&nbsp;– who refused to fight. In Britain 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1999|p=62}}</ref> Many suffered years of prison, including [[solitary confinement]] and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors need apply".

The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.<ref>[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12499.html Uzbeks]. Based on the Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.</ref>

In 1917, a series of [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies in the French army]] led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

In [[Milan]] in May 1917, [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.<ref name="Seton_6">Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925.'' London: Methuen & Co. Ltd. Pp. 471</ref> The Italian army was forced to enter [[Milan]] with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] who fought violently until May 23 when the army gained control of the city with almost fifty people killed (three of which were Italian soldiers) and over 800 people arrested.<ref name="Seton_6"/>

The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] in [[Canada]] erupted when conservative Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking [[Quebec]]ers.<ref>"[http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent.html&series_id=1&episode_id=12&chapter_id=2&page_id=3&lang=E The Conscription Crisis]". CBC.ca.</ref> Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 173,000 were wounded.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| title=World War I| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91513/Canada/43004/World-War-I|accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref>

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly entered into peace negotiations with the Allied powers, with his brother-in-law [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] as intermediary, without the knowledge of his ally Germany. He failed, however, because of the resistance of Italy.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106679/Charles-I#ref214141 Charles (I) (emperor of Austria)]". "Encyclopædia Britannica."</ref>

In September 1917, the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian soldiers in France]] began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied.<ref>{{harvnb|Cockfield|1997|pp=171–237}}</ref> In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees and helped foment the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, with the call going up for "bread, land, and peace". The Bolsheviks reached a peace treaty with Germany, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace of Brest-Litovsk]], despite its harsh conditions.

The end of October 1918, in northern [[German Empire|Germany]], saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]] which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]] spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and shortly thereafter to the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].

====Conscription====
As the war slowly turned into a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], [[conscription]] was implemented in some countries. This issue was particularly explosive in Canada and Australia. In the former it opened a political gap between French-Canadians, who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire, and the Anglophone majority who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada. Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] pushed through a [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]], provoking the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], caused a split in the [[Australian Labor Party]] and Hughes formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917 to pursue the matter. Nevertheless, the [[labour movement]], the Catholic Church, and [[Irish republican|Irish nationalist]] expatriates successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|rejected in two plebiscites]].

Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man in Britain, six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.<ref>{{harvnb|Havighurst|1985|p=131}}</ref>

No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically&nbsp;— four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and the Russian. Four dynasties: the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]], the [[Habsburg]], [[Romanov]]s and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]], together with their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France with 1.4&nbsp;million soldiers dead,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm "France's oldest WWI veteran dies"], ''BBC News'', 20 Jan 2008.</ref> not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia were similarly affected.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA273&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Spencer Tucker (2005), ''Encyclopedia of World War I''], [[ABC-CLIO]], p. 273. ISBN 1851094202</ref>

The war had profound economic consequences. Of the 60&nbsp;million European soldiers who were mobilised from 1914–1918, 8&nbsp;million were killed, 7&nbsp;million were permanently disabled, and 15&nbsp;million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria–Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%.<ref>{{harvnb|Kitchen|2000|p=22}}</ref> About 750,000 German civilians died from [[starvation]] caused by the British blockade during the war.<ref>{{citation| quote=Die miserable Versorgung mit Lebensmitteln erreichte 1916/17 im "Kohlrübenwinter" einen dramatischen Höhepunkt.

Lobbying by [[Chaim Weizmann]] and fear that American Jews would encourage the USA to support Germany culminated in the British government's [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], endorsing creation of a [[Jewish homeland]] in [[Palestine]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50162/Balfour-Declaration "Balfour Declaration" (United Kingdom 1917)], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''.</ref> A total of more than 1,172,000 Jewish soldiers served in the Allied and Central Power forces in World War I, including 450,000 in Czarist Russia and 275,000 in Austria-Hungary.<ref>"[http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jafi75/timeline.html The Jewish Agency for Israel Timeline]"</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}

The social disruption and widespread violence of the [[Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]] sparked more than 2,000 [[pogrom]]s in the former Russian Empire, mostly in the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukraine]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0016_0_15895.html| title=Pogroms| work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]| accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref> An estimated 60,000–200,000&nbsp;civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/modtimeline.html| title=Jewish Modern and Contemporary Periods (ca. 1700–1917)| work=Jewish Virtual Library| accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>

In the aftermath of World War I, Greece [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|fought]] against Turkish nationalists led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], a war which resulted in a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|massive population exchange between the two countries]] under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,451140,00.html "The Diaspora Welcomes the Pope"], ''Der Spiegel'' Online. November 28, 2006.</ref> According to various sources,<ref>[[R. J.

===Peace treaties and national boundaries===
After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers. The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] officially ended the war. Building on [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's 14th point]], the Treaty of Versailles also brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Magliveras|1999|pp=8–12}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Northedge|1986|pp=35–36}}</ref>

In signing the treaty, Germany acknowledged responsibility for the war, agreeing to pay enormous [[war reparations]] and award territory to the victors. The "Guilt Thesis" became a controversial explanation of later events among analysts in Britain and the United States. The Treaty of Versailles caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the [[Nazi]]s, exploited with a [[conspiracy theory]] they called the ''Dolchstosslegende'' ([[Stab-in-the-back legend]]). The [[Weimar Republic]] lost the former [[German colonial empire|colonial possessions]] and was saddled with accepting blame for the war, as well as paying punitive [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for it. Unable to pay them with exports (a result of territorial losses and postwar recession),<ref>{{harvnb|Keynes|1920}}</ref> Germany did so by borrowing from the United States. Runaway inflation in the 1920s contributed to the economic collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the reparations were suspended in 1931 following the [[Stock Market Crash]] in 1929 and the beginnings of the [[Great Depression]] worldwide.

Austria–Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Yugoslavia]], largely but not entirely along ethnic lines.  [[Transylvania]] was shifted from [[Hungary]] to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule.  Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]], only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]].

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]], lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of [[Estonia]], Finland, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it.  [[Bessarabia]] was re-attached to the [[Greater Romania]], as it had been a Romanian territory for more than a thousand years.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1927}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, and much of its non-[[Anatolia]]n territory was awarded as protectorates of various Allied powers.  The Turkish core was reorganised as the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish republican movement]], leading to the [[Turkish Independence War]] and, ultimately, to the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].

==Legacy==
{{Main|World War I in art and literature|Media of World War I|War memorial}}
The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities.

===Memorials===
[[File:Beaumont hamel newfoundland memorial.jpg|thumb|The [[Beaumont Hamel Newfoundland Memorial]] in the Somme.]]
Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to battlefields, the improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], the [[German War Graves Commission]] and [[Le Souvenir français]]. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the [[Menin Gate]] memorial and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]].

[[File:JohnMcCraeportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Surgeon Lt. Col. [[John McCrae]] of Canada, author of ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'', died in 1918 of [[pneumonia]].]]
On 3 May 1915, during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], Lieutenant Alexis Helmer was killed. At his graveside, his friend [[John McCrae]], M.D., of [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], Canada wrote the memorable poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'' as a salute to those who perished in the Great War. Published in [[Punch Magazine|''Punch'']] on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today, especially on [[Armistice Day|Remembrance Day]] and [[Memorial Day]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10200 |title=John McCrae |publisher=Historica }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&ArticleId=A0004849 |author=Evans David |title=John McCrae |work=Canadian Encyclopedia}}</ref>

===Cultural memory===
The First World War had a lasting impact on social memory. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of Victorian England, and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed moment.<ref>Mark David Sheftall, ''Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada'' (2010)</ref>  Historian Samuel Hynes explained:

{{quote|A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.<ref name="Hynes1991">{{Citation|last=Hynes|first=Samuel Lynn|title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture|accessdate=18 May 2010|year=1991|publisher=Atheneum|isbn=9780689121289|pages=i–xii}}</ref>}}

This has become the most common perception of the First World War, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems and stories published subsequently. Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[For King and Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea; while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''Flanders Poppies'' and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.<ref name="Todman2005">{{Citation|last=Todman|first=Daniel|title=The Great War: myth and memory|accessdate=18 May 2010|year=2005|publisher=Hambledon and London|isbn=9781852854591|pages=153–221}}</ref> Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevison]] and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name="Hynes1991" /> Several historians have since countered these interpretations:
[[Image:Siegfried Sassoon by George Charles Beresford (1915).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Siegfried Sassoon]] (May 1915)]]

<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of the First World War. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less [[liberal democracy]]. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.<ref name="Todman2005" /></blockquote>

Though these historians have discounted as "myths"<ref name="Hynes1991" /><ref name="Fussell2000">{{Citation|last=Fussell|first=Paul|title=The Great War and modern memory|url=http://books.google.com/?id=D9iNQYfeKdwC|accessdate=18 May 2010|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=9780195133325|pages=1–78}}</ref> these perceptions of the war, they are nevertheless prevalent across much of society.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as 'aimless' following the contrasting Second World War, and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s.<ref name="Todman2005" /> The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.<ref name="Todman2005" />

===Social trauma===
The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.<ref name="todmanxi-xv"/> Some people{{Who|date=May 2010}} were revolted by nationalism and its results, and so they began to work towards a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world, supporting organisations such as the [[League of Nations]]. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only strength and military could be relied upon in a chaotic and inhumane world. [[Development criticism|Anti-modernist]] views were an outgrowth of the many changes taking place in society.

The experiences of the war led to a collective trauma shared by many from all participating countries. The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle Époque|la belle époque]]'' was destroyed and those who fought in the war were referred to as the [[Lost Generation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roden}}</ref> For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.<ref>{{harvnb|Wohl|1979}}</ref> Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia, now called [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=108–1086}}</ref> Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status.<ref name="todmanxi-xv"/> In the United Kingdom, mass-mobilisation, large casualty rates and the collapse of the [[Edwardian era]] made a strong impression on society. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception.<ref name="todmanxi-xv">Todman, D. ''The Great War, Myth and Memory'', p. xi–xv.</ref> Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.<ref name="todmanxi-xv"/>

The end of the war set the stage for other world conflicts.  For instance, it enabled the rise of the [[Bolshevik]]s and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]].

===Discontent in Germany===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstosslegende'') was a testament to the [[Mental health|psychological state]] of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This [[conspiracy theory]] of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The ''Dolchstosslegende'''s popular acceptance in Germany played a significant role in the rise of Nazism. A sense of disillusionment and [[cynicism]] became pronounced, with [[nihilism]] growing. Many believed the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it because of the high fatalities among a generation of men, the dissolution of governments and empires, and the collapse of capitalism and [[imperialism]].

Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity.  These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. Out of German discontent with the still controversial [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity and power.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml| publisher=BBC| title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/hitlergainspower.htm| title=The Rise of Hitler| accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by the First World War; in fact, it was common for Germans in the 1930s and 1940s to justify acts of international aggression because of perceived injustices imposed by the victors of the First World War.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704030736/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II| archivedate=2008-07-04| title=World War II| work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia| accessdate=2009-11-12| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{citation| last=Baker| first=Kevin |url=http://harpers.org/StabbedInTheBack.html |title=Stabbed in the Back!

===Views in the United States===
U.S. intervention in the war, as well as the Wilson administration, became deeply unpopular. This  was reflected in the [[U.S. Senate]]'s rejection of the [[Versailles treaty]] and membership in the [[League of Nations]].  In the interwar era a consensus arose that U.S. intervention was a mistake, and the Congress passed [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|laws]] in an attempt to preserve U.S. neutrality in any future conflict. Polls taken in 1937 and the opening months of World War II established that nearly  60% regarded the intervention as a mistake, with only 28% opposing that view. But, in the period between the [[fall of France]] and the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], public opinion changed dramatically and, for the first time, a narrow plurality rejected the idea that the war was a mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RPUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3742,5638207&dq=war+poll&hl=en |title=1941 Gallup poll |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

===New national identities===
[[Poland]] reemerged as an independent country, after more than a century. As a "minor Entente nation" and the country with the largest casualties per head<ref>{{cite news |title=Appeals to Americans to Pray for Serbians |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 27, 1918 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9406E4D8143EE433A25754C2A9619C946996D6CF}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Serbia Restored |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 1918 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=990CEFDC113BEE3ABC4D53DFB7678383609EDE }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Minor Powers During World War One&nbsp;– Serbia |first=Matt |last=Simpson |work= |publisher=firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/features/minorpowers_serbia.htm }}</ref> the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its dynasty became the backbone of the new multinational state, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later renamed [[Yugoslavia]]). [[Czechoslovakia]] became a new nation. Russia became the [[Soviet Union]] and lost [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], which became independent countries. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was soon replaced by [[Turkey]] and several other countries in the Middle East.

In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]] became known as those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]]. [[Anzac Day]], commemorating the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], celebrates this defining moment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9400E1DD113FE233A25755C2A9629C946796D6CF&scp=12&sq=New+Zealand+anzac&st=p |title='ANZAC Day' in London; King, Queen, and General Birdwood at Services in Abbey |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 April 1916}}</ref><ref name=awmtradition>

After the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], where the Canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps, Canadians began to refer to theirs as a nation "forged from fire".<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/vimy-ridge-e.aspx| publisher=[[Canadian War Museum]]| title=Vimy Ridge |accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref> Having succeeded on the same battleground where the "mother countries" had previously faltered, they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments. Canada entered the war as a Dominion of the British Empire and remained so afterwards, although she emerged with a greater measure of independence.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/war-impact-e.aspx| title=The War's Impact on Canada| publisher=[[Canadian War Museum]]| accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/05/09/babcock-citizen.html| title=Canada's last WW1 vet gets his citizenship back| publisher=[[CBC News]]| date=2008-05-09}}</ref> While the other Dominions were represented by Britain, Canada was an independent negotiator and signatory of the [[Versailles Treaty]].

===Economic effects===
One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. In order to harness all the power of their societies, new government ministries and powers were created. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many of which have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of the formerly large and bureaucratised governments such as in Austria–Hungary and Germany; however, any analysis of the long-term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00104, Inflation, Tapezieren mit Geldscheinen.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Germany, 1923: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper. Millions of middle-class Germans were ruined by the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]]. When the war began in 1914, a dollar was worth 4.2 marks. By November 1923, the dollar was at 4.2 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]]<ref>10<sup>12</sup> in this context&nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> marks.<ref>"[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,641758,00.html Germany in the Era of Hyperinflation]". Spiegel Online. August 14, 2009.</ref>]]
[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the main three Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most of the pigs were slaughtered and, at war's end, there was no meat.

All nations had increases in the government's share of GDP, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching fifty percent in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans, which, in part, were funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid. In 1934, Britain owed the US $4.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]<ref>10<sup>9</sup> in this context&nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> of World War I debt.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm What's a little debt between friends?]". BBC News. May 10, 2006.</ref>

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and [[Margarine|oleo]]), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917–1918 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, alcohol control, pay disputes, fatigue from overtime and working on Sundays and inadequate housing.

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called upon to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].<ref>{{harvnb|Green|1938|pp=CXXVI}}</ref>

[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (the so-called "war guilt" clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all "loss and damage" suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for [[World War I reparations|reparations]]. The total reparations demanded was 132 billion gold marks which was far more than the total German gold or foreign exchange. The economic problems that the payments brought, and German resentment at their imposition, are usually cited as one of the more significant factors that led to the end of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the beginning of the dictatorship of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After Germany’s defeat in World War II, payment of the reparations was not resumed. There was, however, outstanding German debt that the Weimar Republic had used to pay the reparations. Germany finished paying off the reparations in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1004/Germany-finishes-paying-WWI-reparations-ending-century-of-guilt|title=Germany finishes paying WWI reparations, ending century of 'guilt'}} Christian Science Monitor. 4 October 2010.</ref>
