Today's '''[[pipe organ]]s''' descend from ''a kind of'' early pipe organ {{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=easier to discuss on Talk:Organ (music); click on "discussion" tab above}} that also used wind moving through [[organ pipe|pipes]] to produce sounds. From the 16th century, pipe organs used various materials of pipes, which can vary widely in timbre and volume, and are divided into ranks and controlled by the use of [[Organ stop|hand stops]] and/or [[combination action|combination pistons]].  The keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]];  some divisions{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} may be enclosed in a [[swell box]], allowing  the dynamics to be controlled by shutters.  These instruments vary greatly in size, ranging from a cubic yard to a height reaching five floors,<ref>The [[Wanamaker Organ]] is built from the 2nd to 7th floors.</ref> and are [[organ builder|built]] in churches, synagogues, concert halls, and homes.  Small organs are called '''[[positive organ|positive]]''' (i. e. easily placed in different locations) or '''[[portative organ|portative]]''' (small enough to carry while playing).  Increasingly '''hybrid organs''' are appearing in which pipes are augmented with electronic additions; great economies of space as well as cost are possible especially when the lowest (and largest) of the pipes can be so replaced.

'''Non-piped organs''' include the [[reed organ]] or [[harmonium]], <!-- {{Accuracy|ACCORDION IS NOT AN ORGAN!}} : and [[accordion]] ([[squeezebox]]) --> which like the [[accordion]], [[harmonica]] or mouth organ use air to excite [[Free reed aerophone|free reeds]].

'''[[Electronic organ]]s''' or '''digital organs''' generate electronically-produced sound through one or more [[loudspeaker]]s. <!-- {{Accuracy|MOST TYPE OF HYDRAULOPHONEs ARE NOT PIPE ORGAN. ONLY SOME TYPE OF ACOUSTIC HYDRAULOPHONE USES PIPE TO PRODUCE SOUND}}{{Nonnotable}}: and more exotic instruments like the '''[[hydraulophone]]''', which use pipes but not air -->.

'''[[Mechanical organ]]s''' include the [[barrel organ]], [[water organ]], and [[Orchestrion]]. These are controlled by mechanical means such as pinned [[barrel organ|barrels]] or [[book music]]. Barrel organs dispense with the hands and feet of an [[organist]] and   ''may be''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} powered by an [[organ grinder]] or by other means such as an [[electric motor]].

{{Main|Pipe organ}}

The [[pipe organ]] is the grandest [[musical instrument]] in size and scope, and has existed in its current form since the 14th century (though other designs, such as the [[Hydraulis|hydraulic organ]], were already used in [[ancient history|Antiquity]]). Along with the [[clock]], it was considered one of the most complex human-made creations before the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Pipe organs range in size from a single short keyboard to huge instruments with over 10,000 [[organ pipe|pipe]]s. A large modern organ typically has three or four keyboards ([[Manual (music)|manuals]]) with five octaves (61 notes) each, and a two-and-a-half octave (32-note) [[Pedal clavier|pedalboard]].

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] called the organ the "King of instruments".<ref>[http://ncregister.com/site/article/4552 ''The King of Instruments'' - [[National Catholic Register]]]</ref> Some of the biggest instruments have 64-foot pipes (a foot here means "sonic-foot", a measure quite close to the English measurement unit), and it sounds to an 8&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] frequency fundamental tone. Perhaps the most distinctive feature is the ability to range from the slightest sound to the most powerful, [[plein-jeu]] impressive sonic discharge, which can be sustained in time indefinitely by the organist. For instance, the [[Wanamaker organ]], located in Philadelphia, USA, has sonic resources comparable with three simultaneous symphonic orchestras. Another interesting feature lies in its intrinsic "[[polyphony]]" approach: each set of pipes can be played simultaneously with others, and the sounds mixed and interspersed in the environment, not in the instrument itself. (Contrast this with digital organs, where the electronically-produced sound comes from loudspeakers.)

The principal purpose of most organs in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand is to play in Christian and Reform Jewish religious services.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} An organ used for this purpose is generally called a church organ. The introduction of church organs is traditionally attributed to [[Pope Vitalian]] in the 7th century. Due to its ability to simultaneously provide a musical foundation below the vocal register, support in the vocal register, and increased brightness above the vocal register, the organ is ideally suited to accompany [[human voice]]s, whether a [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]], a [[choir]] or a cantor or soloist. Most services also include solo [[organ repertoire]] for independent performance rather than by way of accompaniment, often as a prelude at the beginning the service and a postlude at the conclusion of the service.

<!-- LAYOUT SPACE TOO SHORT: [[Image:Kaltenbrunnerorgantaiwan.jpg|thumb|Modern style pipe organ at the concert hall of [[Aletheia University]] in [[Danshui]], [[Taiwan]].]] -->
Today this organ may be a [[pipe organ]] (see above), a digital or [[electronic organ]] that generates the sound with [[Digital Signal Processing]] (DSP) chips or a combination of pipes and electronics. It may be called a church organ or classical organ to differentiate it from the [[theatre organ|theater organ]], which is a different style of instrument. However, as classical [[organ repertoire]] was developed for the pipe organ and in turn influenced its development, the line between a church and a concert organ is hard to draw.

Organs are also used to give recital concerts, called [[organ recital]]s. In the early 20th century, [[symphonic organ]]s flourished in secular venues in the United States and UK, designed to replace symphony orchestras by playing transcriptions of orchestral pieces.  Symphonic and orchestral organs largely fell out of favor as the [[Organ reform movement|Orgelbewegung (Organ Reform Movement)]] took hold in the middle of the 20th century and organ builders began to look to historical models for inspiration in constructing new instruments.  Today, modern builders construct organs in a variety of styles and for both secular and sacred applications.

Chamber organs
</heading>
<text>

A chamber organ is a small pipe organ, often with only one manual, and sometimes without separate pedal pipes that is placed in a small room, that this diminutive organ can fill with sound. It is often confined to chamber organ repertoire, as often the organs have too little voice capabilities to rival the grand pipe organs in the performance of the classics. The sound and touch are unique to the instrument, sounding nothing like a large organ with few stops drawn out, but rather much more intimate. They are usually tracker instruments, although the modern builders are often building electropneumatic chamber organs.

Theatre organs

{{Main|theatre organ}}
[[Image:State organ close.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre organ in State Cinema, Grays. (Compton Organ)]]
The [[theatre organ]] or cinema organ was designed to accompany [[silent movie]]s. Like a symphonic organ, it is made to replace an orchestra. However, it includes many more gadgets, such as percussion and special effects, to provide a more complete array of options to the theatre organist. Theatre organs tend not to take nearly as much space as standard organs, relying on [[extension organ|extension]] and higher wind pressures to produce a greater variety of tone and larger volume of sound from fewer pipes.

<div style="position:relative;top:-3ex;bottom:-3ex;">
[[Image:SoloMarHarp.jpg|thumb|Marimba in the solo chamber <span style="font-size:85%;font-strech:narrower">at Ann Arbor's Michigan Theatre (3/13 [[Barton Organ Company|Barton]])</span>]]</div>
This extension is called "unification", meaning that instead of one pipe for each key at all pitches, the higher octaves of pitch (and in some cases, lower octaves) are achieved by merely adding 12 pipes (one octave) to the top and/or bottom of a given division. Assuming there are sixty-one keys on an organ manual (a common number in concert organs and in North America), a classical organ will have, for [[Flue pipe#Diapasons|diapason]] stops at 8', 4' and 2' pitch, a total of 183 pipes (61 plus 61 plus 61). The same chorus of diapasons on a theatre organ will have only 85 pipes (61 plus 12 plus 12). Some ranks, such as the [[Tibia Clausa]], with up to 97 pipes, allow the organist to draw stops at 16', 8', 4', 2', and mutations from a single rank of pipes.

Unification gives a smaller instrument the capability of a much larger one, and works well for monophonic styles of playing (chordal, or chords with solo voice). The sound is, however, thicker and more homogeneous than a classically-designed organ, and is very often reliant on the use of tremulant, which has a depth greater than that usually found on a classical organ. Unification also allows pipe ranks to be played from more than one manual and the pedals.

{{Main|Reed organ|Harmonium|Melodeon (organ)}}

The [[reed organ]] and [[harmonium]] was the other main type of organ before the development of electronic organs. It generated its sounds using reeds similar to those of a [[piano accordion]]. Smaller, cheaper and more portable than the corresponding pipe instrument, these were widely used in smaller churches and in private homes, but their volume and tonal range was extremely limited, and they were generally limited to one or two manuals, pedalboards being extremely rare.

The [[chord organ]] was invented by Laurens Hammond in 1950.<ref name=chordOrgans_Hammond1950>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253678/Laurens-Hammond Laurens Hammond], Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2009 - His later inventions included the chord organ (1950, i.e. Hammond S-6 chord organ).</ref> It provided chord buttons for the left hand, similar to an accordion. Other reed organ manufacturers have also produced chord organs.<ref name=chordOrgans_Magnus1960>[http://www.dbeconline.com/magnus/ Magnus Organ Homepage] - In the 1960s, Magnus introduced their famous Electric Chord Organs to compete with Hammond.</ref>

{{Main|Electronic organ}}

Since the 1930s, pipeless electric instruments have been available to produce similar sounds and perform similar roles to pipe organs. Many of these have been bought both by houses of worship and other potential pipe organ customers, and also by many musicians both professional and amateur for whom a pipe organ would not be a possibility. Far smaller and cheaper to buy than a corresponding pipe instrument, and in many cases portable, they have taken organ music into private homes and into dance bands and other new environments, and have almost completely replaced the reed organ.

{{Main|Hammond organ}}
[[Image:Hammond b3 con leslie 122.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hammond organ|Hammond]] B3 <span style="font-size:90%;">organ, and [[Leslie speaker]] cabinet.</span>]]

The Hammond organ was the first successful electric organ, released in the 1930s. It used mechanical, rotating [[tonewheel]]s to produce the sound waveforms. Its system of [[Hammond_organ#Drawbars|drawbar]]s allowed for setting volumes for specific sounds, and it provided vibrato-like effects. The drawbars allow the player to choose volume levels of 0-8 for each of the members of the harmonic series starting from 16'. By emphasizing certain harmonics from the overtone series, desired sounds (such as 'brass' or 'string') can be imitated. Generally, the older Hammond drawbar organs had only preamplifiers and were connected to an external, amplified speaker. The [[Leslie speaker]] became the most popular, which is a rotating type speaker. The three most popular models of Hammond organs were the consoles: the B-3, C-3, and A-100. Inside all three models, the tone generators, drawbars, and keyboards were identical. The B-3 cabinet stood on 4 legs, the C-3 was an enclosed "church" model, and the A100 series had built in amplifiers and speakers.

In addition to these console models, Hammond also produced spinet models, which differed from the consoles in the size of keyboard (44 keys per keyboard versus 61 for the consoles, and 12 or 13 pedals instead of 25) and the absence of foldback and scaling in the keyboards making them cheaper to manufacture. Other features of the console organs such as vibrato or percussion were included in the spinets; all the spinet models featured a built in amplifier and speaker; when used with the external amplified speaker (e.g.: Leslie) they sound similar to the console models. These smaller all-in-one organs were intended primarily for use in homes or very small churches.

Though originally produced to replace organs in the church, the Hammond organ, especially the model B-3, became popular in [[jazz]], particularly [[soul jazz]], and in [[gospel music]]. Since these were the roots of [[rock and roll]], the Hammond organ became a part of the rock and roll sound. It was widely used in rock and popular music during the 1960s and 1970s by bands like [[The Doors]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Procol Harum]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and [[Deep Purple]]. Its popularity resurged in pop music around 2000, in part due to the availability of [[clonewheel organ]]s that were light enough for one person to carry.

[[Frequency divider organ]]s used [[oscillator]]s instead of mechanical parts to make sound. These were even cheaper and more portable than the Hammond. They featured an ability to bend pitches.

In the 1940s until the 1970s, small organs were sold that simplified traditional [[organ stop]]s. These instruments can be considered the predecessor to modern portable [[Musical Keyboard|keyboards]], as they included one-touch chords, rhythm and accompaniment devices, and other electronically assisted gadgets.  [[Lowrey organ|Lowrey]] was the leading manufacturer of this type of organs in the smaller (spinet) instruments.

In the '60s and '70s, a type of simple, portable electronic organ called the [[combo organ]] was popular, especially with pop and rock bands, and was a signature sound in the pop music of the period, such as [[The Doors]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Iron Butterfly]]. The most popular combo organs were manufactured by [[Farfisa]] and [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]].

[[Conn-Selmer]] and [[Rodgers]], dominant in more larger instrument market, also made electronic organs that used [[Electronic organ#Separate_oscillators|separate oscillators]] for each note, giving them a richer sound, closer to a pipe organ, due to the slight imperfections in tuning, by not using precise division.

Also available are [[Electronic organ#Pipe.2Felectronic_hybrid_organs|hybrids]], starting from early 20th century,<ref name=TheIllustrationNewspaper1934>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001RH0B68	Synthetic Radio Organ Church Diagram French Print 1934], The ILlustration Newspaper of 1934, Paris</ref> which incorporating a few ranks of pipes to produce some sounds, and using electronic circuits or digital samples for other sounds and to resolve borrowing collisions. Major manufacturers include [[Allen Organ|Allen]], Walker, [[John Compton (organ builder)|Compton]], Wicks, Marshall & Ogletree, Phoenix, [[Makin Organs]], [[Wyvern Organs]] and [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]].

Digital organs
</heading>
<text>


The development of the [[integrated circuit]] enabled another revolution in electronic keyboard instruments.
Digital organs sold since the 1970s utilize [[additive synthesis]], then [[sampling (music)|sampling technology]] (1980s) and [[physical modelling synthesis]] (1990s) are also utilized to produce the sound.

Virtual Pipe Organs, played via [[MIDI]], access samples of real pipe organs stored on a computer, as opposed to digital organs that use DSP and processor hardware inside a console to produce sounds or deliver sound samples.  They have high polyphony (up to about 40,000 pipes/1PC), which is necessary as there is a sample for every single pipe on the organ, plus samples and modeling effects such as mechanical action noise and pipe wind fluctuations. Addition of touch screen monitors or custom midi controllers allows the user to control the virtual organ console (drawing stops, operating couplers etc.) In its basic form, without a traditional wooden console, a Virtual Organ can be obtained at a much lower cost than other digital classical organs. With [[Stereo]] or mulitple channel audio systems, virual organs can approach the acoustic realism of a real pipe organ. For example, for most Virtual Organs with a pedal division containing 16&nbsp;ft or 32&nbsp;ft pipes, a subwoofer arrangement is required to reproduce the powerful movement of air at frequencies around 32&nbsp;Hz or lower. For personal purpose, typically small studio quality [[near-field monitors]] with subwoofer are used.<ref name=PCorgan>[http://www.pcorgan.com/FotosEN.html Images of Hauptwerk consoles], PCorgan.com; Hauptwerk's customer set-ups</ref>

The wind can also be created by using pressurized steam instead of air. The steam organ, or [[calliope (music)|calliope]], was invented in the United States in 19th century. Calliopes usually have very loud and clean sound. Calliopes are used as outdoors instruments, and many have been built on wheeled platforms.

Classical music

<text>

{{Main|organ repertoire}}

The organ has had an important place in [[European classical music|classical music]] throughout its history.  [[Antonio de Cabezón]], [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]], and [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]] were three of the most important composers and teachers before 1650. Influenced by these composers, the [[North German school]] then rose to prominence with notable composers including [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] and especially [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], considered by many to have achieved the height of organ composition. During this time, the [[French organ mass|French Classical school]] also flourished.

After Bach, the organ's prominence gradually lost ground to the [[piano]].  [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Alexandre Pierre François Boëly|A.P.F. Boëly]], and [[César Franck]] led a resurgence in the mid-19th century, leading a [[Romantic music|Romantic movement]] that would be carried further by [[Max Reger]], [[Charles-Marie Widor]], [[Louis Vierne]], and others. In the 20th century, composers such as [[Marcel Dupré]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] added significant contributions to the organ repertoire.

Because the organ has both manuals and pedals, organ music has come to be notated on three [[musical staff|staves]]. The music played on the manuals is laid out like music for other keyboard instruments on the top two staves, and the music for the pedals is notated on the third stave or sometimes, to save space, added to the bottom of the second stave as was the early practice. To aid the eye in reading three staves at once, the [[Bar (music)|bar lines]] are broken between the lowest two staves; the brace surrounds only the upper two staves. Because music racks are often built quite low to preserve sightlines over the console, organ music is usually published in oblong or landscape format.

Soap operas
</heading>
<text>

From their creation on radio in the 1930s to the times of television in the early 1970s, [[soap operas]] were perhaps the biggest users of organ music. Day in and day out, the melodramatic serials utilized the instrument in the background of scenes and in their opening and closing theme songs. Some of the best-known soap organists included [[Charles Paul]], [[John Gart]], and [[Paul Barranco]]. In the early 1970s, the organ was phased out in favor of more dramatic, full-blown [[orchestras]], which in turn were replaced with more modern [[Pop music|pop]]-style compositions.


</text>
<heading>
Popular music
</heading>
<text>

Church-style pipe organs are occasionally used in [[popular music]]. In some cases, groups have sought out the sound of the pipe organ, such as [[Tangerine Dream]], and Arrogant Worms, which combined the distinctive sounds of electronic [[synthesizer]]s and pipe organs when it recorded both music [[album]]s and [[video]]s in several [[cathedral]]s in Europe. [[Rick Wakeman]] of British [[progressive rock]] group [[Yes (band)|Yes]] also used pipe organ to excellent effect in a number of the group's albums (including ''[[Close to the Edge (Yes album)|Close to the Edge]]'' and ''[[Going for the One]]''). Wakeman has also used pipe organ in his solo pieces such as "Jane Seymour" from ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives Of Henry VIII]]'' and "Judas Iscariot" from ''Criminal Record''. Even more recently, he has recorded an entire album of organ pieces – ''Rick Wakeman at [[Lincoln Cathedral]]''. [[George Duke]] employed the pipe organ in a flamboyant manner in the piece "50/50" on the [[Frank Zappa]] album ''[[Over-Nite Sensation]]''. [[Dennis DeYoung]] of American [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Styx (band)|Styx]] used the pipe organ at [[Chicago]]'s [[St. James Cathedral, Chicago|St. James Cathedral]] on the song "I'm O.K." on the group's 1978 album ''[[Pieces of Eight (album)|Pieces of Eight]]''. In 2000 [[Radiohead]] frontman [[Thom Yorke]] played the organ on the ''[[Kid A]]'' album to great effect, most notably in "Motion Picture Soundtrack".  More recently, [[Arcade Fire]] have used a church organ on the songs "Intervention" and "My Body Is a Cage" on their second album ''[[Neon Bible]]''. [[Muse (band)|Muse]] have also used a church organ on their album ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' in the form of "Megalomania", played by their frontman [[Matt Bellamy]]. It has been performed live only once on a pipe organ, at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. [[Roger Hodgson]] (formerly of [[Supertramp]]) used a pipe organ for the songs ''Say Goodbye'', ''Open the Door'' and [[Danielle (song)|Danielle]] in 2000 for the album ''[[Open the Door]]''.

On the other hand, [[electronic organ]]s and electromechanical organs such as the [[Hammond organ]] have an established role in a number of non-"Classical" genres, such as blues, jazz, gospel, and 1960s and 1970s rock music. Electronic and electromechanical organs were originally designed as lower-cost substitutes for pipe organs. Despite this intended role as a sacred music instrument, electronic and electromechanical organs' distinctive tone-often modified with electronic effects such as vibrato, rotating Leslie speakers, and overdrive-became an important part of the sound of popular music. [[Billy Preston]] and [[Iron Butterfly]]'s [[Doug Ingle]] have featured organ on popular recordings such as "[[Let it Be (song)|Let it Be]]" and "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]", respectively. Well-known rock artists using the Hammond organ include [[Counting Crows]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], [[Sheryl Crow]], and [[Deep Purple]].

Recent performers of Popular organ music include [[William Rowland]] of [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]] who is noted for his compositions of "Piano Rags," which he plays on a Wurlitzer theatre organ in [[Miami, Oklahoma]]; [[George Wright]] (1920–1998) whose "Jealousie" and "Puttin on the Ritz" are some of the finest performances of this genre and [[Virgil Fox]] (1912–1980), who bridged both the classical and religious areas of music with pop and so-called Heavy Organ concerts that he played on an electronic organ accompanied by a light show similar to those created in the 1960s for rock concerts. [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] was a famous jazz organist of the 20th century.

The American Theatre Organ Society [[ATOS]] has been instrumental in programs to preserve the instruments originally installed in theatres for accompaniment of silent movies. In addition to local chapter events they hold an annual convention each year, highlighting performers and instruments in a specific locale. These instruments feature the Tibia pipe family as their foundation stops and regular use of tremulants. They were usually equipped with mechanical percussion accessories, pianos, and other imitative sounds useful in creating movie sound accompaniments such as auto horns, doorbells, and bird whistles.

Sporting organs
</heading>
<text>

Organ music is commonly associated with several American sports, most notably [[baseball]]. The baseball organ has been referred to as "an accessory to the overall auditory experience of the ballpark."<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAz1pA51vr8</ref> The first team to introduce an organ during breaks of play (before and after games, in between innings, and during longer stoppages) was the [[Chicago Cubs]], who put an organ in [[Wrigley Field]] as an experiment in 1940 and kept it there after positive public reaction. Over the years, many ballparks caught on to the trend, and many organists became well-known and associated with their parks or signature tunes: [[Eddie Layton]] playing at [[Old Yankee Stadium]] for over 50 years, [[Jane Jarvis]] greeting the [[New York Mets]] at [[Shea Stadium]] with their club song "[[Meet the Mets]]", [[Ernie Hays]] serenading a [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] crowd with "[[Here Comes the King]]", Chicago favorite [[Nancy Faust]] urging [[Chicago White Sox]] fans to tell an opposing pitcher or a Pale Hose home run to "[[Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)]]" or [[Rick DePiro]] playing for [[Cleveland Indians]] games and known for his youth and controversy with songs like "[[If I Only Had A Brain]]" played often for the Umpires. During the 1990s, several teams fired their organists and replaced them entirely with recorded music and sound effects. However, many fans support organs at ballparks, believing it to be a traditional aspect of the game. As a result, several teams (notably the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]) have begun to feature organ music more prominently, and in 2009 the [[Atlanta Braves]] re-introduced an organist at [[Turner Field]], even going so far as to promote his [[Twitter]] feed to take requests from fans.

The electronic organ, especially the Hammond B-3, has occupied a significant role in [[jazz]] ever since [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] made it popular in the 1950s. It can function as a replacement for both piano and bass in the standard jazz combo.
