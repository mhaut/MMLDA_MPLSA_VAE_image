[[File:PRCFounding.jpg|thumb|left|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] proclaiming the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949.]]
Major combat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with the Communist Party of China in control of mainland China, and the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) retreating to [[Taiwan]]. On 1 October 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic of China.<ref name="Ref_c">[http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/mao490921.htm The Chinese people have stood up].

The economic and social plan known as the [[Great Leap Forward]] resulted in an estimated 45&nbsp;million deaths.<ref name="Akbar2010">{{Cite news|url =http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title= Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years'|accessdate=October 30, 2010 |publisher=The Independent|location=London|first=Arifa|last=Akbar|date=17 September 2010}}</ref> In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which would last until Mao's death a decade later. The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [[Soviet Union]], led to a major upheaval in Chinese society. In 1972, at the peak of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing to establish relations with the United States. In the same year, the PRC was [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|admitted to the United Nations]] in place of the Republic of China for China's membership of the United Nations, and permanent membership of the Security Council.

After Mao's death in 1976 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, [[Deng Xiaoping]] quickly wrested power from Mao's anointed successor [[Hua Guofeng]]. Although he never became the head of the party or state himself, Deng was in fact the [[Paramount Leader]] of China at that time, his influence within the Party led the country to [[Chinese economic reform|significant economic reforms]]. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [[People's commune|communes]] were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some<ref name="Ref_e">[[Martin Hart-Landsberg|Hart-Landsberg, Martin]]; and [[Paul Burkett|Burkett, Paul]]. [http://www.monthlyreview.org/chinaandsocialism.htm "China and Socialism. Market Reforms and Class Struggle"]. Retrieved 30 October 2008.</ref> "[[market socialism]]", and officially by the Communist Party of China "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]". The PRC adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on 4 December 1982.

In 1989, the death of pro-reform official [[Hu Yaobang]] helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. However, they were eventually put down on 4 June when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, resulting in numerous casualties. This event was widely reported and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government.<ref name="Ref_f">Youngs, R. ''The European Union and the Promotion of Democracy.''

President [[Jiang Zemin]] and Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of Shanghai, led post-Tiananmen PRC in the 1990s. Under Jiang and Zhu's ten years of administration, the PRC's economic performance pulled an estimated 150&nbsp;million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.<ref name="Ref_h">[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm ''Nation bucks trend of global poverty''] (11 July 2003).

''People's Daily''.</ref> The country formally joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001.

Although the PRC needs economic growth to spur its development, the government has begun to worry that rapid economic growth has negatively impacted the country's resources and environment. Another concern is that certain sectors of society are not sufficiently benefiting from the PRC's economic development; one example of this is the wide gap between urban and rural areas. As a result, under current President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], the PRC has initiated policies to address these issues of equitable distribution of resources, but the outcome remains to be seen.<ref name="Ref_j">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4913622.stm ''China worried over pace of growth''].

Additionally the border between the PRC and the ROC is located in [[territorial waters]]. China has a land border of {{convert|22117|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the [[List of land border lengths|largest in the world]].

The territory of China lies between latitudes [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and longitudes [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. It contains a large variety of [[landscapes]]. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, grasslands can be seen. Southern China is dominated by hill country and low mountain ranges. In the central-east are the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang). Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west, major mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas, with China's highest point at the eastern half of [[Mount Everest]], and high [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]].

A major issue is the continued expansion of deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.<ref name="Ref_au">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm "Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm"]. BBC news.

Climate
</heading>
<text>

China has a [[climate]] mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which leads to temperature differences between winter and summer. In winter, northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from sea areas at lower latitude are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's extensive and complex [[topography]].

  |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> China lies in two of the world's major [[ecozone]]s, the [[Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalaya]]. In the Palearctic zone are found such mammals as the horse, camel, [[tapir]], and [[jerboa]]. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the [[Leopard Cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous giant panda is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze. There is a continuing problem with trade in endangered species, although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.

China contains also a variety of forest types. Both northeast and northwest reaches contain mountains and cold coniferous forests, supporting animal species which include moose and [[Asiatic black bear]], along with some 120 types of birds. Moist [[conifer]] forests can have thickets of [[bamboo]] as an understorey, replaced by [[rhododendrons]] in higher montane stands of [[juniper]] and [[taxus|yew]]. [[Subtropical]] forests, which dominate central and southern China, support an astounding 146,000 species of flora. Tropical rainforest and seasonal rainforests, though confined to [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan Island]], actually contain a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in China.

The PRC has been playing an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref name="Ref_s">Dillon, Dana; and Tkacik, John, Jr.; [http://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html ''China’s Quest for Asia''], Policy Review, December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

The PRC is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), with Russia and the Central Asian republics.

In 2000 the U.S. Congress approved "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.<ref name="Ref_t">"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/ Clinton signs China trade bill]".

Sinophobic attitudes often target Chinese [[Chinese diaspora|minorities]] and nationals living outside of China. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died.<ref name="Ref_y">[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 ''Malaysia's race rules''].

Much of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] of Zhou Enlai - non-interference in other states' affairs, non-aggression, peaceful coexistence, and equality and mutual benefits. China's foreign policy is also driven by the concept of "harmony without uniformity" which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. This has led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous by Western nations, such as Zimbabwe, North Korea, or Iran.<ref name="Keith">{{Cite book|last=Keith|first=Ronald C.|title=China from the inside out - fitting the People's republic into the world|publisher=PlutoPress}}</ref> Conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at times in its recent history, particularly with the United States; for example, the [[NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|US bombing of the Chinese embassy]] in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident|US-China spy plane incident]] in April 2001.

The relationship between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]] has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its [[World War II|wartime]] past to the satisfaction of the PRC; take for instance [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials and in some [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. However, Sino-Japanese relations have warmed considerably since [[Shinzo Abe]] became the new Japanese Prime Minister in September 2006. A joint historical study conducted by the PRC and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward a new consensus on the issue of [[Japanese war crimes|WWII atrocities]].<ref name="Ref_ac">[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/09/nanjing_by_the_numbers ''Nanjing by the Numbers''].

Equally bordering the most countries in the world alongside Russia, the PRC was in a number of [[Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]]. China's territorial disputes have led to localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969, and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] in 1979. In 2001, the PRC and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship]],<ref name="Ref_ad">[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm ''Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation''] (21 March 2006).

Other territorial disputes include islands in the [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s, and undefined or disputed land borders with India and Bhutan.

While accompanying a rapid economic rise, the PRC since the 1990s seeks to maintain a policy of quiet diplomacy with its neighbors. It does so by keeping economic growth steady and participating in regional organizations and cultivating bi-lateral relations in order to ease suspicion over China's burgeoning military capabilities. The PRC has started a policy of [[Involvement of the People's Republic of China in Africa|wooing African nations]] for trade and bilateral co-operation.<ref name="Ref_ae">McLaughlin, Abraham; [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0330/p01s01-woaf.html ''A rising China counters US clout in Africa''], The Christian Science Monitor, 30 March 2005 edition.</ref><ref name="Ref_af">Lyman, Princeton N.; [http://www.cfr.org/publication/8436/ ''China’s Rising Role in Africa''], 21 July 2005 Council of Foreign Relations.

The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and certain members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need to address sociopolitical issues with reform. While economic and social controls have been greatly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]]. However, these provisions do not afford significant protection in practice against criminal prosecution by the State.<ref name="Ref_ah">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2009/china |title=Human Rights Watch, World Report 2009 |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=14 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="Ref_ai">''Will the Boat Sink the Water?: The Life of China's Peasants'' / [[Chen Guidi]] and Wu Chuntao (2006) ISBN 1586483587</ref><ref name="Ref_aj">''Empire of Lies: The Truth About China in the Twenty-First Century'' / [[Guy Sorman]] (2008) ISBN 1594032165</ref>

The PRC government has responded by arguing that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present level of [[economic development]], and focus more on the people's rights to subsistence and development in poorer countries.<ref name = "yqlgro">[http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/28/content_18115.htm "China's Progress in Human Rights"] July 2005, Accessed: 18 April 2008.</ref> The rise in the [[standard of living]], [[literacy]], and [[life expectancy]] for the average Chinese in the last three decades is seen by the government as tangible progress made in human rights.<ref name="Ref_ao">[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/first%20beginning/t56058.htm "China's reform and opening-up promotes human rights, says premier"]. 11 December 2003.

The PRC government remains divided over the issue of political reform. Some high ranking members have spoken out in favor reforms, while others remain more conservative. Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] states that the PRC needs "to gradually improve the democratic election system so that state power will truly belong to the people and state power will be used to serve the people." Despite his status, Wen's comments were later censored by the government.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101306347.html Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao talks reform, but most countrymen never get to hear what he says]. ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref>

As the social, cultural and political as well as economic consequences of market reform become increasingly manifest, tensions between the conservative and reformists in the party are sharpening. Some Chinese scholars such as Zhou Tianyong, the vice director of research of the [[Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]], argue that gradual political reform as well as repression of those pushing for overly rapid change over the next thirty years will be essential if China is to avoid an overly turbulent transition to a middle class dominated polity.<ref>[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2005/04/david_cowhig_in.php Part I of summary of Zhou Tianyong's 2004 book Reform of the Chinese Political System] Accessed February 7, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2005/06/zhou_tianyong_r.php Part II of summary of Zhou Tianyong's 2004 book Reform of the Chinese Political System] Accessed February 7, 2007.</ref> Some Chinese look back to the Cultural Revolution and fear chaos if the Communist Party should lose control due to domestic upheavals and so a robust system of monitoring and control is in place to counter the growing pressure for political change.

From its founding in 1949 to late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style centrally [[planned economy]]. [[Private sector|Private businesses]] and capitalism did not exist. To propel the country towards a modern, industrialized communist society, [[Mao Zedong]] instituted the [[Great Leap Forward]]. Following Mao's death and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move to a market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. In 1978, China and Japan had normalized diplomatic relations and China had decided to borrow money from Japan in soft loans. Since 1978, Japan has been the No.1 foreign donor for China. China's economy is mainly characterised as a market economy based on private property ownership.<ref name="Ref_ax">

A wide variety of small-scale enterprises were encouraged while the government relaxed price controls and promoted foreign investment. Foreign trade was focused upon as a major vehicle of growth, which led to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs) first in [[Shenzhen]] (near Hong Kong) and then in other Chinese cities. Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured by introducing western-style management system and the unprofitable ones were closed, resulting in massive job losses.

After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], China started to develop its own [[nuclear weapon]]s and delivery systems, successfully detonating its first surface [[nuclear testing|nuclear test]] in 1964 at [[Lop Lake|Lop Nur]].

This made the PRC the fifth nation to independently launch a satellite.

Domestic air travel has increased significantly, but remains too expensive for most. Long distance transportation is dominated by railways and charter bus systems. Railways are the vital carrier in China; they are monopolized by the state, divided into various railway bureaus in different regions. At the rates of demand it experiences, the system has historically been subject to overcrowding during travel seasons such as ''[[Chunyun]]'' during the [[Chinese New Year]].

The major cities have rapidly expanding networks of [[Rapid transit|underground]] or [[light rail]] systems. Numerous cities are also constructing subways. [[Transport in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] has one of the most developed transport systems in the world.

As of July 2010, there are 1,338,612,968 people in the PRC. About 21% (male 145,461,833; female 128,445,739) are 14 years old or younger, 71% (male 482,439,115; female 455,960,489) are between 15 and 64 years old, and 8% (male 48,562,635; female 53,103,902) are over 65 years old.

The government's goal is [[one-child policy|one child per family]], with exceptions for ethnic minorities and flexibility in rural areas. The government's goal is to stabilize population growth early in the 21st century, though some projections estimate a population of anywhere ranging from 1.4&nbsp;billion to 1.6&nbsp;billion by 2025. Hence, the country's family planning minister has indicated that China will maintain its one-child policy until at least the year 2020.<ref name="Ref_2008b">{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/10/china.onechild/index.html |title=China to keep one-child policy |publisher=CNN |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Population and Natural Increase Rate of PRC.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Population of China from 1949 to 2008]]

The policy is resisted, particularly in rural areas, because of the need for agricultural labour and a traditional preference for boys (who can later serve as male heirs).

The decreasing reliability of PRC population statistics since family planning began in the late 1970s has made evaluating the effectiveness of the policy difficult.<ref name="censuslie"/> Estimates by Chinese demographers of the [[Total fertility rate|average number of children for a Chinese woman]] vary from 1.5 to 2.0.

At that time, the Communist Party started the [[Patriotic Health Campaign]], which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as attacking several diseases. This has shown major results as diseases like cholera, typhoid, and scarlet fever were nearly eradicated.

With economic reform after 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition despite the disappearance, along with the People's Communes, of much of the free public health services provided in the countryside.

In mainland China, the government allows a limited degree of religious freedom, however official tolerance is only extended to members of state-approved religious organizations and not to those who worship underground, such as [[house church]]es.

For centuries, opportunity for economic and social advancement in China could be provided by high performance on [[Imperial examination]]s. The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that [[East Asian calligraphy|calligraphy]] and literati painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. China's traditional values were derived from various versions of [[Confucianism]] and conservatism.

A number of more authoritarian and [[rationalism|rational]] strains of thought have also been influential, such as [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. There was often conflict between the philosophies, such as the individualistic [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucians]], who believed Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian "Asian values."<ref name="Ref_abcdee">Bary, Theodore de.

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born in the old society but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and a Confucian education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and obedience to the state.

Many observers believe that the period following 1949 is a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others say that the CPC's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]], where many aspects of traditional culture were labeled 'regressive and harmful' or 'vestiges of feudalism' by the regime and thus, were [[Cultural revolution#Destruction of antiques, historical sites and culture|destroyed]]. They further argue that many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as [[Confucianism]], [[Chinese art]], literature, and performing arts like [[Beijing opera]], were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.

Today, the Chinese government has accepted a great deal of traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] as an integral part of Chinese society, lauding it as an important achievement of the Chinese civilization and emphasizing it as vital to a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese national identity]]. Since the Cultural Revolution ended, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,<ref name="Ref_abcdef">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0133) "China: Traditional arts".

The overwhelmingly large variety of Chinese cuisine comes mainly from the practice of dynastic period [[Emperor of China|emperors]] hosting  banquets with 100 dishes per meal.<ref name="Kong">Kong, Foong, Ling. [2002]. The Food of Asia. Tuttle Publishing. ISBN 0-7946-0146-4</ref> A countless number of imperial kitchen staff and [[concubines]] were involved in the food preparation process.

Over time, many dishes became part of the everyday-citizen culture. Some of the highest quality restaurants with recipes close to the dynastic periods include [[Fangshan]] restaurant in [[Beihai Park]] [[Beijing]] and the Oriole Pavilion.<ref name="Kong"/> Arguably all branches of [[Cuisine of Hong Kong#Eastern Styles|Hong Kong eastern style]] or even [[American Chinese food]] are in some ways rooted from the original dynastic cuisines.

China has one of the [[Sport in the People's Republic of China|oldest sporting cultures]] in the world, spanning the course of several millennia. There is, in fact, evidence that a form of [[Association football|football]] was played in China in ancient times.<ref name="Ref_abcdel">[http://athleticscholarships.net/history-of-soccer.htm Origins of the Great Game]. 2000. Athleticscholarships.net. Retrieved 23 April 2006.</ref> Besides football,<ref name="Ref_abcdem">[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=370457&cc=5901 ESPN Soccernet]. 2002. ESPN Soccernet.

[[Physical fitness]] is widely emphasized in [[culture of China|Chinese culture]]. Morning exercises are a common activity and often one can find the elderly practicing [[qigong]] and [[tai chi chuan]] in parks or students doing stretches on school campuses.

Young people are also keen on basketball, especially in urban centers with limited space and grass areas. The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] has a huge following among Chinese youths, with [[Yao Ming]] being the idol of many.<ref name="Beech2003">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yao_ming.html |title=Yao Ming |accessdate=30 March 2007 |last=Beech |first=Hannah |work=Asian Heroes |work=Time Magazine | date=28 April 2003}}</ref> Major sporting events were also held in Beijing such as the [[1990 Asian Games]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

Many traditional sports are also played. The popular Chinese dragon boat racing occurs during the [[Dragon Boat Festival]]. In [[Inner Mongolia]], sports such as [[Mongolian wrestling|Mongolian-style wrestling]] and [[horse racing]] are popular. In [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], [[archery]] and [[equestrianism]] are a part of traditional festivals.<ref name="Ref_abcden">Qinfa, Ye.
