{{Main|Name of the Czech Republic}}
The current Czech Republic comprises three historical lands: [[Bohemia]] (Čechy) in the West, [[Moravia]] (Morava) in the South-East, and [[Czech Silesia]] (Slezsko; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern [[Poland]]) in the North-East. Jointly, these 3 parts can be described as "Czech lands", with Czech language being spoken in all three. When the Czech nation regained its independence in 1918, the new state of ''Czechoslovakia'' was constituted to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak territories that were merged together after the WWI (in addition, a small part of Western Ukraine was included as well).

The word ''Czech'' itself came into English later via [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/czech?view=uk |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The current English spelling is the same as an antiquated Czech spelling, however it is unlike the modern ''Čechy'' and ''Česko''. This discrepancy arises from a 15th century [[Orthographia bohemica|reform]] of Czech orthography.

Following the dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]] in the end of 1992, the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single-word name in English. In 1993, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested the name [[Name of the Czech Republic#Czechia|Czechia]] as an official alternative in all situations other than formal official documents and the full names of government institutions; however, this has not become widespread in English, even though most other languages have single-word names for the country (usually their own variants of "Czechia").

Prehistory
</heading>
<text>

Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the [[Neolithic]] era. In the [[classical era]], from the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, the [[Boii]] (see [[Bohemia]]) and later in the 1st century, Germanic tribes of [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe.

[[Slavic peoples]] from the [[Black Sea]] and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] regions settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). Following in the Germans' wake, they moved southwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present day Austria. During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant, [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting their Avar rulers, became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe. The Moravian principality arose in the 8th century (see [[Great Moravia]]).

[[Image:Premysl2Gelnhausen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ottokar II Přemysl at miniature from Gulhausen kodex.]]

The [[History of the Czech lands|Bohemian or Czech state]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. The kingdom of [[Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the entire existence of that confederation.<ref>[http://www.czech.cz/en/czech-republic/history/all-about-czech-history/the-premyslid-dynasty/ The Přemyslid Dynasty – Czech republic]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar I]] (1198–1230), bearing the title “king“ already since 1198, extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming the royal title for Otakar and his descendants. The 13th century was also a period of large-scale [[Germans|German]] immigration. The Germans populated towns and mining districts on the Bohemian periphery and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of the Czech lands. In 1235, the mighty [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]] and after the [[Battle of Legnica]], the Mongols carried their devastating raid into [[Moravia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.impub.co.uk/dlug3.html |title=The Annals of Jan Dlugosz |publisher=Impub.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar II]] (1253–1278) earned the nickname of "the King of Gold and Iron" due to his military power and wealth. He acquired Austria, Styria and Carinthia thus spreading the Bohemian territory to the Adriatic sea. He met his death at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] in 1278, in a war with his rival, the Roman king [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history03.html |title=The rise and fall of the Przemyslid Dynasty |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] acquired the Polish crown in 1300 for himself and the Hungarian crown for his son. In 1306, however, the Přemyslid line died out and, after a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of Luxembourg]] gained the Bohemian crown.

The 14th century, particularly the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1342–1378), is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348. The [[Black Death]], which had raged in Europe from 1347 to 1352, decimated the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1380,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Czech_Hist4.html |title=The flowering and the decline of the Czech medieval state |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> killing about 10% of the population.<ref>''"[http://books.google.com/books?id=3u3rNCWtv0MC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Plague epidemics in Czech countries]"''. E. Strouhal. p.49.</ref>

In the 15th century the religious and social reformer [[Jan Hus]] formed a movement, later named after him. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in Constanz in 1415, his followers seceded from the Catholic Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. [[Petr Chelčický]] continued with Czech Hussite Reformation movement.

During the next two centuries, 90% of the inhabitants converted to the Hussite form of Protestantism. After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. The [[Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which quickly spread throughout Central Europe. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] and the ties between Bohemia and Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The war had a devastating effect on the local population; the people were given the choice either to convert to Catholicism or leave the country.

[[File:Schlacht-Kolin-1.jpg|thumb|Frederick II of Prussia was defeated in the [[Battle of Kolin]], as a result of which he had to evacuate Bohemia.]]

The following period, from 1620 to the late 18th century, has been often called the "Dark Age". The population of the Czech lands declined by a third due to war, disease, famine and the expulsion of the Protestant Czechs.<ref>[http://www.czech.cz/en/czech-republic/history/all-about-czech-history/the-thirty-years-war/ Czech.cz], The Thirty Years' War – Czech republic</ref> The Habsburgs banned all religions other than Catholicism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history_96/history07.html |title=RP's History Online – Habsburgs |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] and [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] invaded Moravia in 1663,<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=j08L5xLOQKwC&pg=PA557&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century.

The reigns of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] (1740–80) and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (1780–90), Holy Roman Emperor and co-regent from 1765, were characterized by [[enlightened absolutism]]. In 1742, most of [[Silesia]], then the possession of the Bohemian crown, was seized by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[Famines in Czech lands|Great Famine]], which lasted from 1770 until 1771, killed about one tenth of the Czech population, or 250,000 inhabitants, and radicalized countrysides leading to peasant uprisings.<ref>"''The Cambridge economic history of Europe: The economic organization of early modern Europe''".

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Bohemia became part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later of [[Austria–Hungary]]. [[Serfdom]] was not completely abolished until 1848. After the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]] attempted to rule as an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]], keeping all the nationalities in check.

{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia}}
An estimated 150,000 Czech soldiers died in World War I. More than 100,000 Czech volunteers formed the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in Russia, where they fought against the [[Central Powers]] and later against [[Bolshevik]] troops.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/105664 Radio Praha – zprávy] {{cs icon}}</ref> Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, the independent republic of [[Czechoslovakia]] was created in 1918.

[[File:Tomáš G Masaryk1918.jpg|thumb|right|185px|[[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], first president of [[Czechoslovakia]].]]
Although Czechoslovakia was a [[unitary state]], it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities. However, it did not grant its minorities any territorial political autonomy. The failure to do so resulted in discontent and strong support among some of the minorities for a break from Czechoslovakia. [[Adolf Hitler]] took advantage of this opportunity and, supported by [[Konrad Henlein]]'s [[Sudeten German Party]], gained the largely [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|German]] speaking [[Sudetenland]] (and its substantial [[Maginot Line]] like [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|border fortifications]]), through the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]]. Poland annexed the [[Zaolzie]] area around [[Český Těšín]]. [[Hungary]] gained parts of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus as a result of the [[First Vienna Award]] in November 1938.

The remainders of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus gained greater autonomy, with the state renamed to "Czecho-Slovakia" (The Second Republic; see [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]). After Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia, allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary and Poland, Slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity, seceding from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and allying itself, as demanded by Germany, with Hitler's coalition.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481.</ref>

The remaining Czech territory was occupied by Germany, which transformed it into the so-called [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The Protectorate was proclaimed part of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and the President and Prime Minister were subordinate to the Nazi ''[[Protector (title)|Reichsprotektor]]'' ("imperial protector"). Subcarpathian Rus declared independence as the Republic of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939, but was invaded by Hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day. Approximately 345,000 Czechoslovak citizens, including 277,000 Jews, were killed or executed, while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and [[Internment|concentration camps]] or used as forced labour. Perhaps two–thirds of the Czech nation was destined either for extermination or removal.<ref>Stephen A. Garrett (1996). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=lF9NBUZlh0AC&pg=PA60&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Conscience and power: an examination of dirty hands and political leadership]''". Palgrave Macmillan. p.60. ISBN 0312159080</ref> A [[Nazism|Nazi]] concentration camp existed at [[Terezín]], to the north of Prague.

There was [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation]], both at home and abroad, most notably with the assassination of Nazi leader [[Reinhard Heydrich]] in a Prague suburb on 27 May 1942. The [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia#Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] and its army fighting against the Germans were acknowledged by the Allies; Czechoslovak troops fought in the UK, North Africa, the Middle East and the [[Soviet Union]]. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and American armies and the [[Prague uprising]]. An estimated 140,000 Soviet soldiers died in the fighting for the liberation of Czechoslovakia.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&pg=PA409&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A Companion to Russian History]''". Abbott Gleason (2009). Wiley-Blackwell. p.409. ISBN 1-4051-3560-3</ref>

In 1945–1946, almost the entire German minority in Czechoslovakia, about 2.7&nbsp;million people, [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II#Czechoslovakia|were expelled]] to Germany and [[Austria]]. During this time, thousands of Germans were held in prisons and detention camps, or used as forced labour. In the summer of 1945, there were several massacres. The only Germans not expelled were some 250,000, who had been active in the resistance against the Nazis or were considered economically important, though many of these emigrated later. Following a Soviet-organised referendum, the Subcarpathian Rus never returned under Czechoslovak rule, but became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] in 1946.

Czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a "bridge" between the West and East. However, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] rapidly increased in popularity, with a general disillusionment with the West, due to the pre-war [[Munich Agreement]], and a favourable popular attitude towards the [[Soviet Union]], due to the Soviets' role in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule. In the 1946 elections, the Communists gained 38% of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament. They formed a coalition government with other parties of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] and moved quickly to consolidate power. The decisive step took place in February 1948, during a series of events characterized by Communists as a "revolution" and by anti-Communists as a "takeover", the Communist [[People's Militias (Czechoslovakia)|People's Militias]] secured control of key locations in Prague, and a new, all-Communist government was formed.

[[File:Memorial lidice children (2007)-commons.JPG|thumb|A memorial to 82 [[Lidice]] children killed by the Nazis in Chelmno.]]

For the next 41 years, Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the [[Eastern Bloc]] (see [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)]]). This period was marked by a variety of social developments. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s, but slowed down in the 1970s, with increasing problems during the 1980s. The political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s, but became more open and tolerant in the 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dubček]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create "socialism with a human face" and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by 21 August 1968 [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion.

The invasion was followed by a harsh program of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]" in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition, though using more "carrot" than "whip" to secure the populace's passivity. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977 and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988. Between 1948 and 1989 more than 250,000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison for "anti-state activities", and over 400,000 emigrated.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4388764.stm Czech schools revisit communism].

<text>

{{main|Velvet Revolution}}
In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful "[[Velvet Revolution]]". However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened and on 1 January 1993, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[capitalism|capitalist economy]]. This process was largely successful, as in 2006, the Czech Republic was recognised by the World Bank as a "developed country"<ref name="worldbank06"/> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".<ref name="hdi09"/>

From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and now in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the European Union on 1 May 2004. It held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] for the first half of 2009.

[[File:Vaclav Klaus headshot.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Václav Klaus]], current President of the Czech Republic.]]

The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], with the [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') is bicameral, with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] ({{lang-cs|Poslanecká sněmovna}}) (200 members) and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Senát'') (81 members).

The [[President of the Czech Republic]] is selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms. The president is a formal [[head of state]] with limited specific powers, most importantly to return bills to the parliament, nominate [[Constitutional court]] judges for the Senate's approval and dissolve the parliament under certain special and unusual circumstances. He also appoints the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|prime minister]], as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister.

The [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] is the head of government and wields considerable powers, including the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy, mobilize the parliamentary majority and choose government ministers.

The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four year term by [[proportional representation]], with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former [[Czechoslovakia]].

The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. The first election was in 1996, for differing terms. This arrangement is modeled on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout, overall roughly 30% in the first round and 20% in the second.

Membership in the European Union is central in Czech Republic's foreign policy. The Czech Republic held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] for the first half of 2009.

{{Main|Military of the Czech Republic}}
The Czech armed forces consist of the [[Military of the Czech Republic|Army]], [[Czech Air Force|Air Force]] and of specialized support units. In 2004, the Czech armed forces completely phased out [[conscription]] and transformed into a fully [[volunteer military]] army and air force. The country has been a member of [[NATO]], since 12 March 1999. Defence spending is around 1.8% of the GDP (2006).

{{See also|Regions of the Czech Republic|Districts of the Czech Republic}}
Since 2000, the Czech Republic is divided into [[List of regions of the Czech Republic|thirteen regions]] ([[Czech language|Czech]]: [[wikt:en:kraj#Czech|''kraje'', singular ''kraj'']]) and the capital city of [[Prague]]. Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (''krajské zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (usually translated as [[hetman]] or "president"). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The older seventy-six [[districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three "statutory cities" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046 The death of the districts], [[Radio Prague]] 3 January 2003.</ref>

Geography

<text>

{{See also|Geography of the Czech Republic|Protected Areas of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Ez-map.png|thumb|left|General map of the Czech Republic]]
The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] (a small area lies north of 51°), and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

The Czech landscape is exceedingly varied. [[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] (or Moldau) rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkonoše]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sněžka]] at {{convert|1602|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. [[Moravia]], the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder River]] ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).

Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sing=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, [[Western European broadleaf forests]] and Carpathian montane conifer forests.

There are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is
[[Krkonoše National Park]] ([[Biosphere Reserve]]), [[Šumava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), National Park Podyjí, České Švýcarsko National Park.

[[File:Smrk a rameno Šance 1.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Šance Dam]], part of the [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]]]]
The Czech Republic has a temperate [[continental climate]], with relatively hot summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. Most rain falls during the summer. The temperature difference between summer and winter is relatively high, due to the landlocked geographical position.

Within the Czech Republic, temperatures vary greatly, depending on the [[elevation]]. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[Bílý Potok (Liberec District)|Bílý Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of Prague. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.

At the highest peak of [[Sněžka]] ({{convert|1602|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=/}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|2}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.

[[File:Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Rolling hills of [[Králický Sněžník]]]]
The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.

The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about 20 degrees higher than during winter. Especially in the last decade,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} are not unusual. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.

Autumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous|deciduous trees]] begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.

Most of the economy has been privatised, including the banks and telecommunications. The current centre-right government plans to continue with privatisation, including the energy industry and the Prague airport. It has recently agreed to the sale of a 7% stake in the energy producer, [[CEZ Group]], with the sale of the [[Budějovický Budvar]] brewery also mooted.

[[Ruzyně International Airport]] is the main international airport in the country. In 2007, it handled 12.4&nbsp;million passengers, which makes it one of the busiest airports in Central Europe. In total, Czech Republic has 46 airports with paved runways, six of which provide international air services.

[[České dráhy]] (the Czech railways) is the main railway operator in the Czech Republic, with about 180&nbsp;million passengers carried yearly. Its cargo division, ČD Cargo, is the fifth largest railway cargo operator in the European Union. With {{convert|9505|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of tracks, the Czech Republic has one of the densest railway networks in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level#Railways |title=Transport infrastructure at regional level – Statistics explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> From that number, {{convert|2926|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} is electrified, {{convert|7617|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} are single-line tracks and {{convert|1866|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} are double and multiple-line tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://provoz.szdc.cz/portal/Show.aspx?oid=185802 |title=SZDC.cz |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>

In 2005, according to the Czech Statistical Office, 65.4% of electricity was produced in steam, combined and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30% in [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6% from renewable sources, including hydropower. Russia, via pipelines through Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Norway, via pipelines through Germany, supply the Czech Republic with liquid and natural gas.

[[File:Czech.highways.png|thumb|right|Czech motorway network]]
The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. [[Nuclear energy]] presently provides about 30% of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40%. Natural gas is procured from [[Russia]]n [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from [[Norway|Norwegian]] companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost two times higher than the electricity consumption. South Moravia has small [[Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic|oil and gas deposits]].

Government-owned Český Telecom slowed down broadband penetration. At the beginning of 2004, [[local-loop unbundling]] began and alternative operators started to offer ADSL and also SDSL. This and later privatisation of Český Telecom helped drive down prices.

On 1 July 2006, Český Telecom was acquired by globalized company (Spain owned) Telefonica group and adopted new name [[Telefónica O2 Czech Republic]]. As of January 2006, ADSL2+ is offered in many variants, both with data limit and without with speeds up to 10 Mbit/s. Cable internet is gaining popularity with its higher download speeds beginning at 2 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s.

The Czech Republic has a rich scientific tradition. From the invention of the modern [[contact lens]] and separation of modern [[blood type]]s, to the production of the [[Semtex]] plastic explosive, the world owes much of its scientific insight to prominent scientists who lived and worked in historically Czech lands, including:

* [[John Amos Comenius|Jan Amos Komenský]] (1592–1670), educator and national hero, often considered the founder of modern education for his work in [[pedagogy]].<ref name="science1">[http://www.czech.cz/en/economy-business-science/science/ingenious-inventions?i=1 Czech.cz – Ingenious inventions]. Retrieved 3 March 2009. {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
* [[Václav Prokop Diviš]] (1698–1765), inventor of the [[lightning rod]]; independently of [[Benjamin Franklin]]
* [[Bernard Bolzano]] (1781–1848), noted mathematician, logician, philosopher, and pacifist.
* [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]] (1787–1869), anatomist and physiologist responsible for the discovery of [[Purkinje cells]], [[Purkinje fibres]] and [[sweat gland]]s, as well as [[Purkinje images]] and the [[Purkinje effect|Purkinje shift]].
* [[Josef Ressel]] (1793–1857), inventor of the [[propeller|screw propeller]].<ref name="science1" />
* [[Gregor Mendel]] (1822–1884), often called the "''father of [[genetics]]''", is famed for his research concerning the inheritance of genetic traits.<ref name="science1" />
* [[Bedřich Hrozný]] (1879–1952), deciphered the [[Hittite language]].<ref name="science1" />
* [[Jaroslav Heyrovský]] (1890–1967), first Czech [[Nobel Prize]] laureate, awarded the prize in 1959 for pioneering research in [[polarography]] and [[Analytical chemistry|electroanalytical chemistry]].<ref name="science1" />
* [[Otto Wichterle]] (1913–1998) and [[Drahoslav Lím]] (1925–2003), Czech [[chemist]]s responsible for the invention of the modern [[contact lens]].<ref>[http://www.eyetopics.com/articles/18/1/The-History-of-Contact-Lenses.html The History of Contact Lenses]. Retrieved 3 March 2009.</ref>
A number of other scientists are also connected in some way with the Czech Lands, including astronomers [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Tycho Brahe]], the founder of the [[psychoanalytic school]] of psychiatry [[Sigmund Freud]], physicists [[Ernst Mach]], [[Albert Einstein]], engineer [[Viktor Kaplan]] and logician [[Kurt Gödel]].

There are several centres of tourist activity.

Other popular tourist sites are the many castles and chateaux, such as those at [[Karlštejn|Karlštejn Castle]], [[Český Krumlov]] and the [[Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape|Lednice–Valtice area]]. Away from the towns, areas such as [[Bohemian Paradise|Český ráj]], [[Bohemian Forest|Šumava]] and the [[Krkonoše|Krkonoše Mountains]] attract visitors seeking outdoor pursuits.

The country is also famous for its love of [[puppeteer|puppetry]] and [[marionette]]s with a number of puppet [[theatre festival|festivals]] throughout the country. The [[Pilsener]] style beer originated in western Bohemian city of [[Plzeň]], and further south the town of [[Budweis]] lent its name to its beer, eventually known as [[Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu]] thus [[Budweiser]].

The Czech Republic, along with [[Estonia]], the [[Nordic countries]], France, the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand]], has one of the least religious populations in the world. Historically, the Czech people have been characterised as "tolerant and even indifferent towards religion".<ref>Richard Felix Staar, Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Issue 269, p. 90</ref> According to the 2001 census, 59% of the country is [[agnosticism|agnostic]], [[atheism|atheist]] or [[Irreligion by country|non-believer]], 26.8% is Roman Catholic and 2.5% is [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.czso.cz/csu/2003edicniplan.nsf/o/4110-03--obyvatelstvo_hlasici_se_k_jednotlivym_cirkvim_a_nabozenskym_spolecnostem|title=Obyvatelstvo hlásící se k jednotlivým církvím a náboženským společnostem|language=Czech|accessdate=19 December 2006|publisher=Czech Statistical Office}}</ref>
According to the census, the fastest growing belief system during the intercensal period between 1991 and 2001 was that of those with no religion, which increased by 19.1 percent. Christianity showed negative growth, especially the Roman Catholic Church which lost more than 1&nbsp;million of its members in 10 years.
The largest population increase was No-religion which increased by nearly 2&nbsp;million people.

{{Main|Music of the Czech Republic}}
Music in the Czech Republic has its roots both in high-culture opera and symphony and in the [[traditional music]] of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]]. Cross-pollination and diversity are important aspects of Czech music. Composers were often influenced by traditional music; jazz and bluegrass music have become popular; pop music partially consisted of English language hits sung in Czech (mostly in years 1960–1989). Notable Czech composers include [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Josef Mysliveček]], [[Leoš Janáček]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], and [[Bedřich Smetana]].

Literature
</heading>
<text>

{{Main|Czech literature}}

[[Czech literature]] is the literature written by [[Czechs]] or other inhabitants of the Czech state, mostly in the [[Czech language]], although other languages like [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Latin]] or German have been also used, especially in the past. Modern authors from the Czech territory who wrote in other languages (e.g. German) are however sometimes considered separately, thus [[Franz Kafka]], for example, who wrote in German (though he was also fluent in Czech), is often considered part of Austrian or German literature.

Czech literature is divided into several main time periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the years of re-Catholicization and the baroque; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the 19th century; the avantgarde of the interwar period; the years under Communism and the Prague Spring; and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic. Czech literature and culture played a major role on at least two occasions, when Czech society lived under oppression and no political activity was possible. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to create political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.

Theatre

<text>

{{Main|Theatre of the Czech Republic}}

[[Theatre of the Czech Republic]] has rich tradition with roots in the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, the theatre played an important role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century it became a part of the modern European theatre art.

{{Main|Czech cuisine}}
[[File:VeproKnedloZelo-00.jpg|thumb|right|''Vepřo-knedlo-zelo'' (Roast pork with [[dumpling]]s and [[sauerkraut]]).]]
Czech cuisine is marked by a strong emphasis on meat dishes. Pork is quite common; beef and chicken are also popular. Goose, duck, rabbit and wild game are served. Fish is rare, with the occasional exception of fresh [[trout]] and [[carp]], which is served at Christmas.

Aside from [[Slivovitz]], [[Czech beer]] and [[Czech wine|wine]], Czechs also produce two uniquely Czech liquors, [[Fernet Stock]] and [[Becherovka]]. [[Kofola]] is a non-alcoholic domestic [[cola]] [[soft drink]] which competes with [[Coca Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] in popularity.

Sports
</heading>
<text>

{{See also|Sport in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic national football team}}
Sports play a part in the life of many [[Czechs]], who are generally loyal supporters of their favourite teams or individuals. The two leading sports in the Czech Republic are [[Association football|football]] (soccer) and [[ice hockey]], both drawing the largest attention of both the media and supporters. Tennis is also a very big sport in the Czech Republic. The many other sports with professional leagues and structures include basketball, volleyball, [[team handball]], [[track and field athletics]] and [[floorball]].

Sport is a source of strong waves of [[patriotism]], usually rising several days or weeks before an event and sinking several days after. The events considered the most important by Czech fans are: the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], Olympic Ice hockey tournament, [[UEFA European Football Championship]], [[FIFA World Cup]] and qualification matches for such events. In general, any international match of the Czech ice hockey or football national team draws attention, especially when played against a traditional rival: Germany and [[Netherlands]] in football; [[Russia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Canada]] in ice hockey; and [[Slovakia]] in both.
