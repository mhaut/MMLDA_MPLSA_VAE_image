[[File:Rice 02.jpg|thumb|left|Planting rice is a labour-intensive process.]]

The seeds of the rice plant are first milled using a [[rice huller]] to remove the [[chaff]] (the outer husks of the grain). At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the '[[bran]]', ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the disease [[beriberi]].

White rice may also be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called ''polished rice'', though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into [[flour]]. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.

In some countries [[parboiled rice]] is popular. Parboiled rice is subjected to a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice. This causes nutrients from the outer husk, especially [[thiamine]], to move into the grain itself. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.

Despite the hypothetical health risks of talc (such as stomach cancer),<ref>[http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/cosmetics/talc.htm Risks of Talcum Powder]</ref> talc-coated rice remains the norm in some countries due to its attractive shiny appearance, but it has been banned in some, and is no longer widely used in others (such as the United States). Even where talc is not used, glucose, starch, or other coatings may be used to improve the appearance of the grains.

[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and [[Takuan]].

Raw rice may be ground into [[flour]] for many uses, including making many kinds of [[beverage]]s such as [[amazake]], [[horchata]], [[rice milk]], and [[sake]]. Rice flour does  not contain [[gluten]] and is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]]. Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually 1 week to 30 days); see also ''Gaba rice'' below.

Processed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Cooked rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or [[butter]], or beaten in a tub to make [[mochi]].

Rice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name="Protein content">{{cite web | url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6M-44XK5WK-3&_user=918210&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000047944&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=918210&md5=65f76ac6c52c83d057a73ee21f915f0e#sec7 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G. Wu |coauthors=Chunhai Shia and Xiaoming Zhanga | year=2003 | accessdate=2008-01-08 | publisher=Field Crops Research}}</ref>

Rice, like other [[cereal]] [[caryopsis|grains]], can be [[Puffed rice|puffed (or popped)]]. This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing pre-puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means that either lowering the local pressure or raising the water [[temperature]] results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm³. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.

:''Further information: [[Steamed rice]]''
There are many varieties of rice; for many purposes the main distinction is between long- and medium-grain rice. The grains of long-grain rice (high [[amylose]]) tend to remain intact after cooking; medium-grain rice (high [[amylopectin]]) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for [[risotto]] in Italy and many ''[[arrossos]]'' &mdash; as in [[arròs negre]], etc. &mdash; in Spain.

Rice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. It can be cooked in just as much water as it absorbs (the absorption method), or in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving (the rapid-boil method).<ref>The latter method of using excess water is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are flushed away when the water is discarded.</ref>  Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice is often heated in oil{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} before boiling, or oil is added to the water; this is thought to make the cooked rice less sticky.

In [[Arab cuisine]] rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves. When combined with milk, sugar and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Medieval Islamic texts spoke of medical uses for the plant.<ref>Watson, p. 15</ref>

Rice may also be made into [[rice porridge]] (also called congee, fawrclaab, okayu, jook, or rice gruel) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water to the point that it becomes very soft, expanded, and fluffy. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.

Rice may be soaked prior to cooking, which saves fuel, decreases cooking time, minimizes exposure to high temperature and thus decreases the stickiness of the rice. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains.

[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is milled, fully cooked and then dried. There is also a significant degradation in taste and texture.

A nutritionally superior method of preparing brown rice known as '''GABA Rice''' or GBR (Germinated Brown Rice)<ref>Shoichi Ito and Yukihiro Ishikawa Tottori University, Japan. {{cite web | title=(Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread.) | url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html | accessdate=February 12, 2004 }}</ref> may be used. This involves soaking washed brown rice for 20 h in warm water (38[[degree Celsius|°C]] or 100[[degree Fahrenheit|°F]]) prior to cooking it. This process stimulates [[germination]], which [[activator|activates]] various [[enzymes]] in the rice. By this method, a result of research carried out for the [[United Nations]] [[International Year of Rice]], it is possible to obtain a more complete [[amino acid]] profile, including [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]].

Cooked rice can contain [[Bacillus cereus]] spores, which produce an [[emetic]] toxin when left at {{convert|4|–|60|°C|°F}} [http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/food-safety-topics/foodborne-illnesses/safe-cooling-of-cooked-rice/index.htm]. When storing cooked rice for use the next day, rapid cooling is advised to reduce the risk of toxin production.

Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in batters and breadings to increase crispiness.

Changes in the morphology of Diaotonghuan phytoliths dating from 10,000-8,000 BP show that rice had by this time been domesticated.<ref>[[Richard MacNeish|MacNeish R. S.]] and Libby J. eds.

The earliest remains of cultivated rice in India have been found in the north and west and date from around 2000 BC. Perennial wild rices still grow in [[Assam]] and [[Nepal]]. It seems to have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} It then spread to all the fertile alluvial plains watered by rivers. Cultivation and cooking methods are thought to have spread to the west rapidly and by medieval times, southern Europe saw the introduction of rice as a hearty grain.

Rice is first mentioned in the [[Yajur Veda]] (c. 1500-800 BC) and then is frequently referred to in [[Sanskrit]] texts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In India, there is a saying that grains of rice should be like two brothers, close but not stuck together.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Rice is often directly associated with prosperity and fertility, therefore there is the custom of throwing rice at weddings.<ref>http://ask.yahoo.com/20030626.html</ref>

Today, the majority of all rice produced comes from [[China]], [[Korea]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]],  and [[Japan]]. [[Asian people|Asian]] farmers still account for 92% of the world's total rice production. Rice is grown in all parts of India, Northern and Central Pakistan. Basmati rice cultivated in the northern plains of the [[Punjab region]] is famous all over the world for its aroma and quality.

One of the earliest known examples of [[companion plant]]ing is the growing of rice with [[Azolla]], aka mosquito fern, which covers the top of a fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.

African rice has been cultivated for 3500 years. Between 1500 and 800 BC, ''[[Oryza glaberrima]]'' propagated from its original centre, the [[Niger River]] [[river delta|delta]], and extended to [[Senegal]]. However, it never developed far from its original region. Its cultivation even declined in favour of the Asian species, possibly brought to the African [[continent]] by Arabs coming from the east coast between the 6th and 11th centuries CE.

According to Zohary and Hopf (2000, p.&nbsp;91), ''O. sativa'' was introduced to the Middle East in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Parthia]]n times, and was familiar to both Greek and Roman writers. They report that a large sample of rice grains was recovered from a grave at [[Susa]] in [[Iran]] (dated to the 1st century AD) at one end of the ancient world, while at the same time rice was grown in the [[Po River|Po]] valley in Italy.

In [[Iraq]] rice was grown in some areas of southern Iraq. With the rise of Islam it moved north to [[Nisibin]], the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] and then beyond the Muslim world into the valley of [[Volga]]. In [[Israel]], rice came to be grown in the Jordan Valley. Rice is also grown in Yemen.<ref name="Watson">Watson, p. 17-18</ref>

The Moors brought Asiatic rice to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 10th century. Records indicate it was grown in [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and [[Majorca]]. In Majorca, rice cultivation seems to have stopped after the Christian [[Reconquesta|conquest]], although historians are not certain.<ref name="Watson" />

Muslims also brought rice to [[Sicily]], where it was an important crop<ref name="Watson" /> long before it is noted in the plain of [[Pisa]] (1468) or  in the Lombard plain (1475), where its cultivation was promoted by [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, and demonstrated in his model farms.<ref>H.C. Darby, "The face of Europe on the eve of the great discoveries", in ''The New Cambridge Modern History'', vol. 1, 1957:32.</ref>

After the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later propagating to all the continents during the age of European exploration.

[[File:MansfieldWinnowingBarn.jpg|thumb|right|South Carolina rice plantation ([[Mansfield Plantation]], Georgetown.)]]
In 1694, rice arrived in [[South Carolina]], probably originating from [[Madagascar]].<ref name="slaveryinamerica.org"/>

In the United States, [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] South Carolina and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] grew and amassed great wealth from the Slavery labor obtained from the [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]] area of [[West Africa]] and from coastal Sierra Leone. At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices, in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantation]]s around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. From the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was milled by hand with [[wood]]en paddles, then winnowed in [[sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward. Rice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as "Carolina Gold." The [[cultivar]] has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop.<ref>http://www.carolinagoldricefoundation.org/ Carolina Gold Rice Foundation</ref>

In the southern United States, rice has been grown in southern [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and east [[Texas]] since the mid-19th century. Many [[Cajun]] farmers grew rice in wet marshes and low lying prairies where they could also farm [[crayfish]] when the fields were flooded.<ref>[http://www.crawfish.com/farmed-crawfish-vs-wild-crawfish.php Farm Raised Crawfish]</ref> In recent years rice production has risen in North America, especially in the [[Mississippi River Delta]] areas in the states of [[Arkansas]] and [[Mississippi]].

Rice cultivation began in [[California]] during the [[California Gold Rush]], when an estimated 40,000 Chinese laborers immigrated to the state and grew small amounts of the grain for their own consumption. However, commercial production began only in 1912 in the town of [[Richvale, California|Richvale]] in [[Butte County, California|Butte County]].<ref name="Historic Richvale">{{cite web | url=http://www.cfbf.com/magazine/MagazineStory.cfm?ID=17&ck=70EFDF2EC9B086079795C442636B55FB | title=Historic Richvale — the birthplace of California rice | author=Ching Lee | publisher=California Farm Bureau Federation | year=2005 | accessdate=2007-08-10 }}</ref> By 2006, California produced the second largest rice crop in the United States,<ref name="CRC region">{{cite web | url=http://www.calrice.org/e7b_cas_rice_growing_region.htm | title=California's Rice Growing Region | publisher=California Rice Commission | accessdate=2007-08-10 }}</ref> after Arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].<ref name="CRC economic">{{cite web | url=http://www.calrice.org/c3a_economic_impact.htm | title=The economic contributions of the California rice industry | author=Daniel A.

Australia
</heading>
<text>

Rice was one of the earliest crops planted in Australia by British settlers, who had experience with rice plantations in the Americas and the subcontinent.

Although attempts to grow rice in the well-watered north of Australia have been made for many years, they have consistently failed because of inherent [[iron]] and [[manganese]] toxicities in the soils and destruction by [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s.

In the 1920s it was seen as a possible [[irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] crop on soils within the [[Murray-Darling Basin]] that were too heavy for the cultivation of fruit and too infertile for [[wheat]].<ref name="Wadham, Sir Samuel p. 246">Wadham, Sir Samuel; Wilson, R. Kent and Wood, Joyce; '''Land Utilization in Australia''', 3rd ed. Published 1957 by Melbourne University Press; p. 246</ref>

Because irrigation water, despite the extremely low runoff of temperate Australia, was (and remains) very cheap, the growing of rice was taken up by agricultural groups over the following decades. Californian varieties of rice were found suitable for the climate in the [[Riverina]], and the first mill opened at [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]] in 1951.

Even before this Australia's rice production greatly exceeded local needs,<ref name="Wadham, Sir Samuel p. 246" /> and rice exports to Japan have become a major source of foreign currency. Above-average rainfall from the 1950s to the middle 1990s<ref>Australian Bureau of Meteorology; '''Climatic Atlas of Australia: Rainfall'''; published 2000 by Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Victoria</ref> encouraged the expansion of the Riverina rice industry, but its prodigious water use in a practically waterless region began to attract the attention of environmental scientists. These became severely concerned with declining flow in the [[Snowy River]] and the lower [[Murray River]].

Although rice growing in Australia is highly profitable due to the cheapness of land, several recent years of severe drought have led many to call for its elimination because of its effects on extremely fragile aquatic ecosystems. The Australian rice industry is somewhat opportunistic, with the area planted varying significantly from season to season depending on water allocations in the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] irrigation regions.

Production

<text>

World production of rice<ref>all figures from UNCTAD 1998–2002 and the [http://www.irri.org/science/ricestat/index.asp International Rice Research Institute] statistics (accessed September 2005)</ref>{{dead link|date=January 2011}} has risen steadily from about 200 million tonnes of paddy rice in 1960 to over 607.9 million tonnes in 2004, 634.5 million tonnes in 2005, and 685 million tonnes in 2008. In 2004, the top four producers were China (26% of world production), India (20%), Indonesia (9%) and Pakistan (5%).{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Harvesting, drying and milling
</heading>
<text>

Unmilled rice, known as paddy (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25 percent. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labour groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20 percent for milling. A familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of moulds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tons a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tons a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72 percent but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60 percent. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.


</text>
<heading>
Distribution
</heading>
<text>

Because of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all  heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds), From Parastatals to Private Trade. International Food Policy Research Institute and Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008</ref>

Trade
</heading>
<text>


World trade figures are very different to those for production, as only about 5–6% of rice produced is traded internationally. The largest three exporting countries are [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], and the United States. Major importers usually include [[Bangladesh]], the [[Philippines]], [[Brazil]] and some African and [[Persian Gulf]] countries. Although China and India are the two largest producers of rice in the world, both countries consume the majority of the rice produced domestically, leaving little to be traded internationally.


</text>
<heading>
Price
</heading>
<text>

In late 2007 to May 2008, the price of grains rose greatly due to droughts in major producing countries (particularly Australia), increased use of grains for animal feed and US subsidies for bio-fuel production. Although there was no shortage of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam) and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice prices. In late [[2008#April|April 2008]], prices hit 24 [[US cent]]s a [[pound (mass)|pound]], twice the price of seven months earlier.<ref name=cyclone>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7387251.stm "Cyclone fuels rice price increase"], ''BBC News'', 7 May 2008</ref>

On April 30, 2008, [[Thailand]] announced plans for the creation of the [[Organisation of Rice Exporting Countries]] (OREC) with the intention that this should develop into a price-fixing [[cartel]] for rice.<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200804/s2232076.htm?tab=asia "Mekong nations to form rice price-fixing cartel"], Radio Australia, April 30, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/01May2008_news07.php "PM floats idea of five-nation rice cartel"], ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', May 1, 2008.</ref>

Between 1961 and 2002, [[per capita]] consumption of rice increased by 40%.

Rice is the most important crop in Asia. In [[Cambodia]], for example, 90% of the total agricultural area is used for rice production.<ref>[http://sidharta.com/books/index.jsp?uid=67  Don Puckridge, ''The Burning of the Rice'']</ref>

Environmental impacts
</heading>
<text>

In many countries where rice is the main [[Cereal|cereal crop]], rice cultivation is responsible for most of the methane emissions.<ref>[http://www.ciesin.org/docs/004-032/004-032.html Methane Emission from Rice Fields - Wetland rice fields may make a major contribution to global warming] by Heinz-Ulrich Neue.</ref>  Rice requires slightly more water to produce than other grains.<ref>[http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report12.pdf report12.pdf Virtual Water Trade - Proceedings of the International Expert Meeting on Virtual Water Trade] p. 108</ref>

As sea levels rise, rice will become more inclined to remain flooded for longer periods of time. The longer it stays in water, it cuts the soil off from atmospheric oxygen and causes fermentation of organic matter in the soil. During the wet season, rice cannot hold the carbon in anaerobic conditions. The microbes in the soil convert the carbon into methane which is then released through the respiration of the rice plant or through [[diffusion]] of water.  Current contributions of methane from agriculture is ~15% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, as estimated by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]. A further rise in sea level of 10-85 centimeters would then stimulate the release of more methane into the air by rice plants. [[Methane]] is twenty times more potent a greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>IPCC. Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

A 2010 study found that, as a result of rising temperatures and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century, the rice yield growth rate has decreased in many parts of Asia, compared to what would have been observed had the temperature and solar radiation trends not occurred.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1001222107 |author=Welch, Jarrod R.; Vincent, J.R.; Auffhammer, M.; Doberman, A.; Moya, P.; Dawe, D. |title=Rice yields in tropical/subtropical Asia exhibit large but opposing sensitivities to minimum and maximum temperatures |journal=Proc.

The study was based on records from 227 farms in six important rice-producing countries like Thailand, Vietnam, India, China, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The mechanism of this falling yield was not clear but might involve increased respiration during warm nights, so expending energy without being able to photosynthesise.

{{Main|List of rice diseases}}
Rice pests are any [[organisms]] or [[microbes]] with the potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop (or of rice seeds).<ref>Jahn et al. 2000</ref> (Jahn et al. 2007) Rice pests include weeds, [[pathogen]]s, insects, rodents, and birds. A variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including the overuse of [[pesticides]] and high rates of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] application.<ref>[http://docserver.esa.catchword.org/deliver/cw/pdf/esa/freepdfs/0046225x/v34n4s26.pdf e.g. Jahn et al. 2005]</ref> Weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. For example, rice [[gall midge]] and [[army worm]] outbreaks tend to follow periods of high rainfall early in the wet season, while [[thrips]] outbreaks are associated with drought.<ref>[http://www.aciar.gov.au/web.nsf/att/ACIA-6Y2342/$file/Rice%20In%20Laos%20chapter%2016-25.pdf Douangboupha et al. 2006]</ref>

[[Crop protection]] scientists are trying to develop rice pest management techniques which are [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable]]. In other words, to manage crop pests in such a manner that future crop production is not threatened.<ref>Jahn et al. 2001</ref> At present, rice pest management includes cultural techniques, pest-resistant rice varieties, and [[pesticide]]s (which include [[insecticide]]). Increasingly, there is evidence that farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary, and even facilitate pest outbreaks.<ref>[http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/cambodia/docs/pestMgmtCamLoLnd.pdf Jahn et al. 1996]</ref><ref>[http://www.petrra-irri.org/html/sp_doc_download.asp?doc_id=105 2004a,b)]</ref><ref>[http://www.scidev.net/Features/index.cfm?fuseaction=readfeatures&itemid=306&language=1]</ref><ref>[http://www.irri.org/videos/LITE-research.wmv]</ref><ref>[http://www.irri.org/videos/LITE-research.rm]</ref><ref>[http://science.notary.ru/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T5T-50RV88N-1&_user=10&_coverDate=08%2F11%2F2010&_rdoc=15&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info%28%23toc%235011%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles%29&_cdi=5011&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=31&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=8db120fbb3abec61a518cd449310dec7&searchtype=a]</ref> By reducing the populations of natural enemies of rice pests,<ref>(Jahn 1992)</ref> misuse of insecticides can actually lead to pest outbreaks (Cohen et al. 1994). Botanicals, so-called "natural pesticides", are used by some farmers in an attempt to control rice pests. Botanicals include extracts of leaves, or  a mulch of the leaves themselves. Some upland rice farmers in Cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush (''[[Chromolaena odorata]]'') over the surface of fields after planting. This practice probably helps the soil retain moisture and thereby facilitates seed germination. Farmers also claim the leaves are a natural fertilizer and helps suppress weed and insect infestations.<ref>(Jahn et al. 1999)</ref>

Among rice cultivars there are differences in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage.<ref>([http://titania.esa.catchword.org/vl=10988418/cl=24/nw=1/rpsv/cw/esa/00220493/v97n6/s20/p1923 Jahn et al. 2004c], Khiev et al. 2000)</ref> Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance.<ref>[http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/glossary/default.htm#Glossary/D.htm Definition of resistance]</ref> Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.<ref>Painter 1951, Smith 2005)</ref> Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].<ref>Kogan and Ortman, 1978</ref> Over time, the use of pest resistant rice varieties selects for pests that are able to overcome these mechanisms of resistance. When a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down. Rice varieties that can be widely grown for many years in the presence of pests, and retain their ability to withstand the pests are said to have durable resistance. Mutants of popular rice varieties are regularly screened by plant breeders to discover new sources of durable resistance.<ref>(e.g. Liu et al. 2005, [http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/esa/00220493/v101n2/s44.pdf?expires=1209291646&id=0000&titleid=10264&checksum=359D8EA730A84C8A612AC6A8F046DCE6 Sangha et al. 2008])</ref>

Cultivars
</heading>
<text>

{{Main|List of rice varieties}}
[[File:Rice diversity.jpg|thumb|right|Rice seed collection from [[IRRI]]]]

While most rice is bred for crop quality and productivity, there are varieties selected for characteristics such as texture, smell, and firmness. Cultivars exist that are adapted to deep flooding, and these are generally called "floating rice".<ref>http://www.cgiar.org/impact/research/rice.html</ref>

There are four major categories of rice worldwide: Indica, [[japonica rice|japonica]], [[Aromatic rice|aromatic]] and [[glutinous rice|glutinous]]. The different varieties of rice are not considered interchangeable, either in food preparation or agriculture, so as a result, each major variety is a completely separate market from other varieties. It is common for one variety of rice to rise in price while another one drops in price.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/Rice/SpecialArticle/USricemarket.pdf|title=The U.S. Rice Export Market|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]|date=Nov 2000}}</ref>

The largest collection of rice cultivars is at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([http://www.irri.org/ IRRI]) in the [[Philippines]], with over 100,000 rice accessions<ref>http://www.irri.org/media/press/press.asp?id=1</ref> held in the International Rice Genebank.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005709332130 |author=Jackson MT |title=Conservation of rice genetic resources: the role of the International Rice Genebank at IRRI |journal=Plant Mol. Biol. |volume=35 |issue=1-2 |pages=61–7 |year=1997 |month=September |pmid=9291960 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0167-4412&volume=35&page=61}}</ref> Rice [[cultivar]]s are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as "glutinous rice" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to "gluten") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.

Indian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (ਬਾਸਮਤੀ) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]] and short-grained Sona Masoori (also spelled [[sona masuri|Sona Masuri]]). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.
[[File:Unpolished-rice.jpg|thumb|Unpolished long-grain rice grains with bran]]
[[File:sona-masuri.jpg|right|thumb|Polished Indian [[sona masuri]] rice grains]]

Aromatic rices have definite aromas and flavours; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America sold under the trade name, Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavour. In Indonesia there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.

High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystem]]s called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in [[West Africa]].

Draft [[genome]]s for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pair]]s). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005 | publisher=washingtonpost.com | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html?referrer=email }}</ref>

On December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice. The declaration was sponsored by more than 40 countries.

High-yielding varieties
</heading>
<text>

{{Main|High-yielding variety}}
The High Yielding Varieties are a group of crops created intentionally during the [[Green Revolution]] to increase global food production. Rice, like corn and wheat, was genetically manipulated to increase its yield. This project enabled labor markets in Asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors. The first "Rice Car", IR8 was produced in 1966 at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] which is based in the Philippines at the [[University of the Philippines]]' Los Baños site. IR8 was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named "Peta" and a Chinese variety named "Dee Geo Woo Gen."<ref name="ir8">[http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm Rice Varieties: IRRI Knowledge Bank. Accessed August 2006]</ref>

Scientists have identified and cloned many genes involved in the [[gibberellin]] signaling pathway, including GAI1 ([[Gibberellin]] Insensitive) and SLR1 (Slender Rice).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092804 |author=Yamaguchi, S. |title=Gibberellin Metabolism and its Regulation |journal=Ann Rev Plant Biol |volume=59 |pages=225–251 |year=2008 }}</ref> Disruption of [[gibberellin]] signaling can lead to significantly reduced stem growth leading to a dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.

Future potential
</heading>
<text>

As the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the "Green Revolution" is cited as the model for economic development.  With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity.  An important way this can happen is the production of "[[New Rices for Africa]]" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology "from Africa, for Africa".  The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].

Golden rice
</heading>
<text>

{{Main|Golden rice}}
Rice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]].  German and Swiss researchers have [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] rice to produce [[beta-carotene]], the precursor to vitamin A, in the rice kernel. The beta-carotene turns the processed (white) rice a "gold" color, hence the name "golden rice".  The beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in humans who consume the rice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/PDFs/ASNonGR.pdf |title=Researchers Determine That Golden Rice Is an Effective Source of Vitamin A |publisher=[[American Society for Nutrition]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-10-28 }}</ref>  Although some rice strains produce beta-carotene in the hull, no non-genetically engineered strains have been found that produce beta-carotene in the kernel, despite the testing of thousands of strains.  Additional efforts are being made to improve the quantity and quality of other nutrients in golden rice.<ref name="gcgh">Grand Challenges in Global Health, [http://www.gatesfoundation.org/nr/downloads/globalhealth/GCGH_Grants_Backgrounder.pdf Press release], June 27, 2005</ref>

Expression of human proteins
</heading>
<text>

[[Ventria Bioscience]] has [[genetically modified]] rice to [[gene expression|express]] [[lactoferrin]], [[lysozyme]], and [[human serum albumin]] which are [[protein]]s usually found in [[breast milk]]. These proteins have [[Antiviral protein|antiviral]], [[antibacterial]], and [[antifungal]] effects.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070514/full/070514-17.html#B1 Nature's story]
</ref>

Rice containing these added proteins can be used as a component in [[oral rehydration solution]]s which are used to treat [[diarrhea]]l diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements may also help reverse [[anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:BIOM.0000027714.56331.b8 |author=Bethell DR, Huang J |title=Recombinant human lactoferrin treatment for global health issues: iron deficiency and acute diarrhea |journal=Biometals |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=337–42 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15222487 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0966-0844&volume=17&page=337}}</ref>

Sayings
</heading>
<text>

*In the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]], there is a saying in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], "Annam Parabrahma Swaroopam" which means 'Rice (Food) is a form of God'.
*The expression for eating a meal in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], "Htamin Sar" means to eat rice. It is similar in the Thai  "gin kow".  Vietnamese use the phrase "ăn cơm" in the same way, as do Bengali people use the phrase "bhat khaowa".
*[[Bengali people]] identify themselves as 'Bengali by rice and fish', alluding to their collective [[Bengali cuisine|food habit]].
*A proverbial saying in Japan states: "The farmer spends eighty-eight efforts on rice from planting to crop." This teaches the sense of [[mottainai]] and [[gratitude]] for the farmer and for rice itself.<ref>[http://www.maff.go.jp/j/heya/sodan/0404/19.html proverbial] saying, [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)]], (Japanese)</ref>
*There is a Sri Lankan saying, 'deyyange haal kawila', meaning 'having eaten God's rice'. This is used to explain a crazy person or his actions in general with humour. The reasoning behind this is that when the rice harvest is collected, a small fraction of the best part is dedicated to the gods and that is sacred - if a person eats that, they will be afflicted with curses and lose mental stability/act crazy.
*The Korean term for meals is "bap 밥" which means rice. It is equivalent to the Japanese word "meshi めし" which also means rice. Both of which are also equivalent to the Chinese word "fan 飯" which also means rice.
*Hmong culture has a saying, "annokao bin biao", literally "grains of rice", which is a metaphor for great effort or exertion.
*In the Philippines and Malaysia there is an expression "One grain of rice equals one bead of sweat". This expression is meant to encourage appreciation of the high level of labour involved in the production of the rice and of food in general and to discourage wasting it.
* In Costa Rica there is a popular expression "arroz con mango", which literally means, "rice with mango", that it's used to denote an absurd or nonsensical situation. This, because in Costa Rican cuisine rice is a main dish and mango, being a sweet fruit (and often used as a dessert) are never supposed to mix or even mingle in any kind of dish.
* In Puerto rico there is a popular expression "Estás como el arroz blanco", which means "you are like white rice". White rice is most popular way of cooking rice in Puerto Rico. So it means that you are everywhere, popular, highly sought.
