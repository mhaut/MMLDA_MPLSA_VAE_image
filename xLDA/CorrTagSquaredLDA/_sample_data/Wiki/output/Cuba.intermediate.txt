Etymology
</heading>
<text>

The name ''Cuba'' comes from the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] language. The exact meaning of the name is unclear but it may be translated either as ''where fertile land is abundant'' (cubao),<ref>Alfred Carrada, ''[http://www.alfredcarrada.org/notes8.html The Dictionary of the Taino Language (plate 8)]''{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref> or ''great place'' (coabana).<ref>[http://members.dandy.net/~orocobix/terms1.htm Dictionary – Taino indigenous peoples of the Caribbean Dictionary --]{{Verify credibility|date=June 2009}}</ref> Scholars who believe that [[Origin theories of Christopher Columbus#Portuguese hypothesis|Christopher Columbus was Portuguese]] state that ''Cuba'' was named by Columbus for the [[Cuba (Portugal)|ancient town of Cuba]] in the district of [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] in [[Portugal]].<ref>Augusto Mascarenhas Barreto: O Português. Cristóvão Colombo Agente Secreto do Rei Dom João II. Ed. Referendo, Lissabon 1988. English: The Portuguese Columbus: secret agent of King John&nbsp;II, Palgrave Macmillan, ISBN 0-333-56315-8</ref><ref>da Silva, Manuel L. and Silvia Jorge da Silva. (2008). ''Christopher Columbus was Portuguese'', Express Printing, Fall River, MA. 396pp. ISBN 9781607028246.</ref>

The Republic of Cuba remains the only country in the world whose name has not been changed in any way following the communist revolution. Adjectives such as "Soviet", "Socialist", "People's", "Democratic" or "Bolivarian" were in common use in other communist states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Cuba was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] people known as the [[Taíno]], also called [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] by the Spanish, and [[Guanajatabey]] and [[Ciboney people]] before the arrival of the Spanish. The ancestors of these Native Americans migrated from the mainland of North, Central and South America several centuries earlier.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Art and archaeology of pre-Columbian Cuba|page=22|year=1996|author=Ramón Dacal Moure, Manuel Rivero de la Calle|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=082293955X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=PEE9oipDYksC&pg=PA22}}</ref> The native Tainos called the island ''Caobana''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indio.net/taino/main/language/Tisland.htm |title=Taino Name for the Islands |publisher=Indio.net |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> The Taíno were farmers and the Ciboney were farmers and [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

Cuba remained a Spanish possession for almost 400 years (1511–1898), with an economy based on [[Agriculture of Cuba|plantation agriculture]], [[mining]], and the export of [[sugar]], [[coffee]], and [[tobacco]] to Europe and later to North America. The work was done primarily by [[African slave trade|African slaves]] brought to the island.

The small land-owning elite of Spanish settlers held social and economic powers supported by a population of Spaniards born on the island ([[Criollo (people)|Criollos]]), other Europeans, and African-descended slaves. The population in 1817 was 630,980, of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 free black, and 224,268 black slaves.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=o-OVsN5SwPIC&pg=PA352&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Latin America's Wars: The age of the caudillo, 1791-1899]''.

In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in [[Latin America]] rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal. Although there was agitation for independence, the Spanish Crown gave Cuba the motto ''La Siempre Fidelísima Isla'' ("The Always Most Faithful Island"). This loyalty was due partly to Cuban settlers' dependence on Spain for trade, their desire for protection from [[pirate]]s and against a [[slave rebellion]], and partly because they feared the rising power of the United States more than they disliked Spanish rule.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Independence from Spain was the motive for a rebellion in 1868 led by [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]]. The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the [[Ten Years' War]].

Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army which relied mostly on [[guerrilla]] and [[sabotage]] tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression.

The U.S. battleship [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|''Maine'']] arrived in Havana on {{Nowrap|25 January}} 1898 to offer protection to the 8,000 American residents on the island, but the Spanish saw this as intimidation.

The facts remain disputed today, although an investigation by Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] in 1976 established that the blast was most likely a large internal explosion.

[[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had fought in the Spanish-American War and had some sympathies with the independence movement, succeeded McKinley as U.S. President in 1901 and abandoned the treaty. Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S. on {{Nowrap|May 20}}, 1902, as the Republic of Cuba. Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the [[Platt Amendment]], the U.S. leased the [[Guantánamo Bay]] naval base from Cuba.

Following disputed elections in 1906, the first president, [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], faced an armed revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government forces.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Corruption in Cuba: Castro and Beyond|page=63|first=Sergio|last=Diaz-Briquets|coauthor=Jorge F Pérez-López|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=2006|isbn=0292713215|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Fiquofr8LSoC&pg=PA63|accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> The U.S. intervened by occupying Cuba and named [[Charles Edward Magoon]] as Governor for three years.

During [[World War I]], Cuba exported considerable quantities of sugar to Britain. Cuba was able to avoid [[U-boat]] attacks by the subterfuge of shipping the sugar to [[Sweden]]. The [[Mario García Menocal|Menocal]] government declared war on Germany very soon after the United States.

A constitutional government was maintained until 1930 when [[Gerardo Machado y Morales]] suspended the constitution. During Machado's tenure, a nationalistic economic program was pursued with several major [[Infrastructure of Cuba|national development projects]] which included the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]] and [[El Capitolio]]. Machado's hold on power was weakened following a decline in demand for exported agricultural produce due to the [[Great Depression]], attacks by independence war veterans, and attacks by covert terrorist organizations, principally the ABC.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The Party then installed [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]], son of Cuba's founding father (Carlos Manuel de Céspedes), as President. During 4–{{Nowrap|5 September}} 1933, a second coup overthrew Céspedes which led to the formation of the first [[Ramón Grau]] government. Notable events in this violent period include the separate sieges of [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba]] and [[Blas Hernández|Atares Castle]]. This government lasted 100 days but engineered radical socialist changes in Cuban society and a rejection of the Platt Amendment.

The 1952 election was a three-way race. [[Roberto Agramonte]] of the Ortodoxos party led in all the polls, followed by Dr. Aurelio Hevia of the Auténtico party, and Fulgencio Batista, seeking a return to office, as a distant third. Both Agramonte and Hevia had decided to name Col. [[Ramón Barquín]] to head the Cuban armed forces after the elections. Barquín, then a diplomat in [[Washington, DC]], was a top officer. He was respected by the professional army and had promised to eliminate corruption in the ranks. Batista feared that Barquín would oust him and his followers. When it became apparent that Batista had little chance of winning, he staged a coup on {{Nowrap|10 March}} 1952. Batista held on to power with the backing of a [[nationalist]] section of the army as a "provisional president" for the next two years.

In March 1952 Justo Carrillo informed Barquín in Washington that the inner circles knew that Batista had plotted the coup. They immediately began to conspire to oust Batista and restore democracy and civilian government in what was later dubbed ''La Conspiracion de los Puros de 1956'' (Agrupacion Montecristi). In 1954, Batista agreed to elections. The [[Partido Auténtico]] put forward ex-President Grau as their candidate, but he withdrew amid allegations that Batista was rigging the elections in advance.

{{rquote|right| At the beginning of 1959 United States companies owned about 40 percent of the Cuban sugar lands – almost all the cattle ranches – 90 percent of the mines and mineral concessions – 80 percent of the utilities – practically all the oil industry – and supplied two-thirds of Cuba's imports.

In April 1956 Batista ordered Barquín to become General and chief of the army, but Barquín decided to move forward with his coup to secure total power. On {{Nowrap|4 April}} 1956, a coup by hundreds of career officers led by Barquín was frustrated by Rios Morejon. The coup broke the back of the Cuban armed forces. The officers were sentenced to the maximum terms allowed by Cuban Martial Law. Barquín was sentenced to solitary confinement for eight years. ''La Conspiración de los Puros'' resulted in the imprisonment of the commanders of the armed forces and the closing of the military academies.

{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}

On 2 December 1956 a party of 82 people on the yacht ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' landed in Cuba. The party, led by [[Fidel Castro]], had the intention of establishing an armed resistance movement in the [[Sierra Maestra]]. While facing armed resistance from Castro's rebel fighters in the mountains, Fulgencio Batista's regime was weakened and crippled by a United States [[arms embargo]] imposed on {{Nowrap|14 March}} 1958. By late 1958, the rebels broke out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general popular insurrection. After the fighters captured [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], Batista fled from Havana on {{Nowrap|1 January}} 1959 to exile in [[Portugal]]. Barquín negotiated the symbolic change of command between [[Camilo Cienfuegos]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Raúl Castro]], and his brother Fidel Castro after the Supreme Court decided that the Revolution was the source of law and its representatives should assume command.

Fidel Castro's forces entered the capital on {{Nowrap|8 January}} 1959. Shortly afterward, a liberal lawyer, Dr [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]] became president. He was backed by Castro's [[26th of July Movement]] because they believed his appointment would be welcomed by the United States.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Disagreements within the government culminated in Urrutia's resignation in {{Nowrap|July 1959}}. He was replaced by [[Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado]], who served as president until 1976. Castro became prime minister in {{Nowrap|February 1959}}, succeeding [[José Miró Cardona|José Miró]] in that post.

By 1963, Cuba was moving towards a full-fledged Communist system modeled on the USSR.<ref>Faria, Miguel A. ''Cuba in Revolution – Escape From a Lost Paradise'', 2002, Hacienda Publishing, Inc., Macon, Georgia, pp. 163–228</ref> The U.S. imposed a complete diplomatic and commercial embargo on Cuba and began [[Cuban Project|Operation Mongoose]], a program of covert CIA operations.

In 1965, Castro merged his revolutionary organizations with the Communist Party, of which he became First Secretary; [[Blas Roca]] was named Second Secretary. Roca was succeeded by Raúl Castro, who, as Defense Minister and Fidel's closest confidant, became and remained the second most powerful figure in Cuba until his brother's retirement. Raúl's position was strengthened by the departure of Che Guevara to launch unsuccessful insurrections in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and then [[Bolivia]], where he was killed in 1967.

During the 1970s, Fidel Castro dispatched tens of thousands troops in support of Soviet-supported wars in Africa, particularly the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]] in [[Angola]] and [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in [[Ethiopia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=To Make a World Safe for Revolution|author=Jorge I.

Cuba was suspended from the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1962 in support of the U.S. embargo, but in 1975 the OAS lifted all sanctions against Cuba, with approval of 16 countries, including the U.S.<ref>[http://www.petersoninstitute.org/research/topics/sanctions/cuba2.cfm Case Studies in Sanctions and Terrorism: Case 60-3, US v.

On 3 June 2009, the OAS adopted a resolution to end the 47-year exclusion of Cuba. The meetings were contentious, with the U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] walking out at one point. However, in the end, the U.S. delegation agreed with the other members and approved the resolution.

The Cuban state adheres to [[socialist]] principles in organizing its largely state-controlled [[planned economy]]. Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen a trend towards more private sector employment. By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf|title=Social Policy at the crossroads|format=PDF|publisher=oxfamamerica.org|accessdate=2009-02-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Capital investment is restricted and requires approval by the government.

Cuba relied heavily on trade with the [[Soviet Union]]. From the late 1980s, Soviet subsidies for Cuban goods started to dry up. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its exports. The removal of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid depression known in Cuba as the Special Period. In 1992 the United States tightened the [[trade embargo]], hoping to see democratization of the sort that took place in Eastern Europe.

Like some other Communist and post-Communist states following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba took limited free market-oriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. These steps included allowing some self-employment in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors, the legalization of the use of the [[US dollar]] in business, and the encouragement of [[Tourism in Cuba|tourism]]. Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system (the ''[[organopónicos]]'') to compensate for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union. In recent years, Cuba has rolled back some of the market oriented measures undertaken in the 1990s. In 2004 Cuban officials publicly backed the [[Euro]] as a "global counter-balance to the US dollar", and eliminated U.S. currency from circulation in its stores and businesses.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Paramount issues have been state salaries failing to meet personal needs under the state [[rationing in Cuba|rationing]] system, chronically plagued with shortages.

The Constitution of 1976, which defined Cuba as a [[socialist republic]], was replaced by the Constitution of 1992, which is guided by the ideas of [[José Martí]], [[Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and [[Lenin]].<ref name=constitution>{{cite web|url=http://www.parlamentocubano.cu/ingles/constitution.html|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Cuba|publisher=National Assembly of People's Power|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> The constitution describes the Communist Party of Cuba as the "leading force of society and of the state".<ref name=constitution/> The first secretary of the Communist Party is concurrently President of the Council of State ([[President of Cuba]]) and President of the [[Council of Ministers of Cuba|Council of Ministers]] (sometimes referred to as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/1203299.stm|title=Country profile: Cuba|publisher=BBC News|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> Members of both councils are elected by the [[National Assembly of People's Power]].<ref name=constitution/> The President of Cuba, who is also elected by the Assembly, serves for five years and there is no limit to the number of terms of office.<ref name=constitution/>

The [[Supreme Court of Cuba]] serves as the nation's highest judicial branch of government. It is also the court of last resort for all appeals against the decisions of provincial courts.

Cuba's national legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power (''Asamblea Nacional de Poder Popular''), is the supreme organ of power; 609 members serve five-year terms.<ref name=constitution/> The assembly meets twice a year; between sessions legislative power is held by the 31 member Council of Ministers. Candidates for the Assembly are approved by public referendum. All Cuban citizens over 16 who have not been convicted of a criminal offense can vote. Article 131 of the Constitution states that voting shall be "through free, equal and secret vote".<ref name=constitution/> Article 136 states: "In order for deputies or delegates to be considered elected they must get more than half the number of valid votes cast in the electoral districts".<ref name=constitution/> Votes are cast by [[secret ballot]] and counted in public view. Nominees are chosen at local gatherings from multiple candidates before gaining approval from election committees. In the subsequent election, there is only one candidate for each seat, who must gain a majority to be elected.

No [[List of political parties in Cuba|political party]] is permitted to nominate candidates or campaign on the island, though the Communist Party of Cuba has held five party congress meetings since 1975. In 1997 the party claimed 780,000 members, and representatives generally constitute at least half of the Councils of state and the National Assembly. The remaining positions are filled by candidates nominally without party affiliation. Other political parties campaign and raise finances internationally, while activity within Cuba by [[opposition to Fidel Castro|opposition groups]] is minimal and illegal.

{{anchor|Provinces and municipalities}}The country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente. The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided. The provinces are divided into municipalities.

{{Main|Foreign relations of Cuba}}

From its inception, the Cuban Revolution defined itself as [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], joining [[Comecon]] in 1972. Cuba was a major contributor to Soviet-supported wars in Africa, Central America and Asia. In Africa, the largest war was in [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Angola]], where Cuba sent tens of thousands of troops. Cuba was a friend of the Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207|title=Superpower diplomacy in the Horn of Africa|page=207|year=1987|author=Samuel M.

The Cuban government's military involvement in Latin America—mostly with the aim of overthrowing U.S. backed right wing regimes, many of them dictatorial—has been extensive. One of the earliest interventions was the Marxist militia led by Che Guevara in Bolivia in 1967, though a modicum of funds and troops were sent. Lesser known actions include the 1959 missions to the [[Dominican Republic]]<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=Waterloo Daily Courier|date=1959-06-24|location=Waterloo, Iowa|title=AP 1950 Invasion Wiped Out Says Trujillo|page=7}}{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref> and [[Panama]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In the former, the Cuban government provided military assistance to a group of Dominican exiles with the intention of overthrowing the tyrannical dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]].

{{Main|Geography of Cuba}}

[[File:Alejandro de Humboldt National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Alejandro de Humboldt National Park]] in eastern Cuba]]

Cuba is an [[archipelago]] of islands located in the northern [[Caribbean Sea]] at the confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and longitudes [[74th meridian west|74°]] and [[85th meridian west|85°W]]. The United States lies to the north-west, [[the Bahamas]] to the north, [[Haiti]] to the east, [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south, and [[Mexico]] to the west. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.

The main island is {{convert|1199|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|105006|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the [[List of islands by area|16th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1975|m|abbr=on}}). The second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|3056|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Cuba has a total land area of {{convert|110860|km2|abbr=on|0}}.

Climate

<text>

{{Main|Climate of Cuba}}

[[File:Cayol3.jpg|thumb|left|Beach on [[Cayo Largo del Sur]] in the Canarreos archipelago]]

The local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|°C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. These are most common in September and October.

The most important mineral resource is [[nickel]], of which Cuba has the world's second largest reserves (after Russia).<ref name=torres>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/1997/9509097.pdf|title=The Mineral Industry of Cuba|author=Ivette E.

Between 1882 and 1898, a total of 508,455 people left Spain, and more than 750,000 Spanish immigrants left for Cuba between 1899 and 1923, with many returning back to Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |title=La inmigración entre 1902 y 1920 |publisher=Tau.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

According to the census of 2002, the population was 11,177,743,<ref name=census/> including 5,597,233 men and 5,580,510 women. The racial make-up was 7,271,926 whites, 1,126,894 blacks and 2,778,923 mulattoes (or mestizos).<ref>{{cite web|last=DePalma|first=Anthony|year=1998|month={{Nowrap|July 5}}|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/41/310.html|title=Cuban Site Casts Light on an Extinct People|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref> The population of Cuba has very complex origins and intermarriage between diverse groups is general. There is disagreement about racial statistics.

The [[Minority Rights Group International]] says that "An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 33.9 per cent to 62 per cent".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d342c.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Cuba: Afro-Cubans}}</ref>

Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in the demographic profile of Cuba during the 20th century. During the 18th, 19th, and the early part of the 20th century large waves of [[Canarian people|Canarian]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]], [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Galician people|Galician]], and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. Between 1900 and 1930 close to a million Spaniards arrived from Spain. Other foreign immigrants include: French,<ref>[http://www.cubagenweb.org/french/index.htm#refugees Etat des propriétés rurales appartenant à des Français dans l'île de Cuba] from http://www.cubagenweb.org Cuban Genealogy Center]</ref> [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[British people|British]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and other ethnic groups, including a small number of descendants of U.S. citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Cuba has a sizable number of [[Asian people]] who comprise 1% of the population. They are primarily of Chinese descent (see [[Chinese Cubans]]), followed by [[Filipinos|Filipino]], [[Koreans]] and [[Vietnamese people]]. They are descendants of farm laborers brought to the island by Spanish and American contractors during the 19th and early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Afro-Cubans]] are descended primarily from the [[Kongo people]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009|reason=Unreliable source removed: joshuaproject.net}}, as well as several thousand [[North Africa]]n refugees, most notably the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi Arabs]] of [[Western Sahara]] under [[Morocco|Moroccan]] occupation since 1976.<ref>{{cite web|date=31 March 2006|url=http://www.moroccotimes.com/Paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=13816|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061125161820/http://www.moroccotimes.com/Paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=13816|archivedate=2006-11-25|title=Sahrawi children inhumanely treated in Cuba, former Cuban official|publisher=MoroccoTimes.com|accessdate=2006-07-09}} (archived from [http://www.moroccotimes.com/Paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=13816 the original] on 2006-11-25)</ref>

Cuba is officially a secular state. After having long maintained that churches were fronts for subversive political activity, the government reversed course in 1992, amending the constitution to characterize the state as secular instead of atheist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It has many faiths representing the widely varying culture. [[Roman Catholicism]] was the largest religion; it was brought to the island by the Spanish and remains the dominant faith,<ref name=catholic>{{cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/033106/033106o.php|title=Catholic church in Cuba strives to re-establish the faith|author=David Einhorn|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|date=31 March 2006|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> with 11 dioceses, 56 orders of nuns, and 24 orders of priests. In {{Nowrap|January 1998}}, [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]] paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and Catholic Church. The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly marked by [[syncretisms]] of various kinds. Catholicism is often practiced in tandem with [[Santería]], a mixture of Catholicism and other, mainly African, faiths that include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of ''Cobre'') is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess [[Oshun]].

Three hundred thousand Cubans belong to the island's 54 Protestant denominations. Pentecostalism has grown rapidly in recent years, and the Assemblies of God alone claims a membership of over 100,000 people. Cuba has small communities of Jews, Muslims and members of the Bahá'í Faith.<ref>{{cite web|year=2005|month={{Nowrap|June 13}}|url=http://news.bahai.org/story.cfm?storyid=377|title=Government officials visit Baha'i center|publisher=Baha'iWorldNewsService.com}}</ref> Most Jewish Cubans are descendants of Polish and Russian Ashkenazi Jews who fled pogroms at the beginning of the 20th century. There is a sizeable number of Sephardic Jews in Cuba who trace their origin to Turkey. Most of these Sephardic Jews live in the provinces, although they maintain a synagogue in Havana.

[[File:Università de La Habana.jpg|thumb|[[University of Havana]], founded in 1728]]

The [[University of Havana]] was founded in 1728 and there are a number of other well-established colleges and universities. In 1957, just before Castro came to power, the literacy rate was fourth in the region at almost 80% according to the United Nations, higher than in Spain.<ref name=asce/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/125095.html|title=Still Stuck on Castro – How the press handled a tyrant's farewell}}{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref> Castro created an entirely state-operated system and banned private institutions. School attendance is compulsory from ages six to the end of basic secondary education (normally at age 15), and all students, regardless of age or gender, wear school uniforms with the color denoting grade level. Primary education lasts for six years, secondary education is divided into basic and pre-university education.<ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org">{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099080026826/The_Cuban_education_system_lessonsEn00.pdf |title=The Cuban Education System: Lessons and Dilemmas.

Higher education is provided by universities, higher institutes, higher [[pedagogical]] institutes, and higher polytechnic institutes. The Cuban Ministry of Higher Education operates a scheme of distance education which provides regular afternoon and evening courses in rural areas for agricultural workers. Education has a strong political and ideological emphasis, and students progressing to higher education are expected to have a commitment to the goals of Cuba.<ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/> Cuba has provided state subsidized education to a limited number of foreign nationals at the [[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19942866/ |title=Students graduate from Cuban school – Americas – MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-07-25 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6914265.stm|title=Cuba-trained US doctors graduate|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=2009-09-07 | work=BBC News}}</ref> Internet access is limited.<ref>Resolución 120 del 2007 del Ministro del MIC la cual está vigente desde el ·0 de Septiembre de 2007</ref> The sale of computer equipment is strictly regulated.

According to the UN, the life expectancy in Cuba is 78.3 years (76.2 for males and 80.4 for females). This ranks Cuba 37th in the world and 3rd in the Americas, behind only Canada and Chile, and just ahead of the United States.

{{Main|Culture of Cuba|Sport in Cuba}}

Cuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain and Africa. Sport is Cuba's national passion. Due to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports which are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally promoted in other Spanish-speaking nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is by far the most popular; other sports and pastimes include [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[track and field athletics|athletics]]. Cuba is a dominant force in [[amateur boxing]], consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions.

{{Main|Music of Cuba}}
[[File:Casa de la Trova Santiago Cuba.jpg|thumb|A local musical house, Casa de la Trova in Santiago de Cuba]]

Cuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of culture. The central form of this music is [[Son (music)|Son]], which has been the basis of many other musical styles like [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] and an upbeat derivation of the rumba, the [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha]]. Rumba music originated in early Afro-Cuban culture. The [[Tres]] was also invented in Cuba, but other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Taíno nations|Taíno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[güiro]], [[marimba]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuacan]]. Popular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s. During that time, [[reggaetón]] was  growing in popularity. Dance in Cuba has taken a major boost over the 1990s.

[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]

Cuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume11/alvarez.pdf|title=Rationed Products and Something Else: Food Availability and Distribution in 2000 Cuba|work=Cuba in Transition|volume=11|pages=305–322|author=José Alvarez|year=2001|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time. The typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Platillo Moros y Cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.

Literature

{{Main|Cuban literature}}

Cuba has produced more than its fair share of literature. Cuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicolás Guillén]] and [[Jose Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce María Loynaz]] and [[José Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica – Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref> Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Daína Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Gutiérrez]], [[Zoé Valdés]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.
