Kosovo in Tito's Yugoslavia (1945–1986)
</heading>
<text>

{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}
Tensions between the Serbian and Kosovo communities simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the [[First Balkan War]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The [[Socialist]] government of [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed nationalist manifestations throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no Yugoslav republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]&mdash;the largest and most populous republic&mdash;was diluted by the establishment of autonomous governments in the province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north of Serbia and Kosovo in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians were left in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Albanians in the Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]
though the majority of its inhabitants were Albanian. Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. Tito's [[UDBA|secret police]] cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956, a number of [[Albanians]] were put on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] were politically insignificant. Their long-term impact was substantial, though, as some&mdash;particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded by [[Adem Demaci]]&mdash;were to form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.

Student demonstrations and riots in [[Belgrade]] in June 1968 spread to Kosovo in November the same year, but were quelled by the Yugoslav security forces. However, some of the students' demands&mdash;in particular, representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies, and better recognition of the [[Albanian language]]&mdash;were conceded by Tito. The [[University of Priština]] was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]]. The Albanianisation of education in Kosovo was hampered by the lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia, so an agreement was struck with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] itself to supply textbooks. In 1974, Kosovo's political status was improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with [[Socialist Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], Kosovo was [[Socialist Province of Kosovo|declared a province]] and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the federal presidency and its own assembly, police force, and national bank.

Power was still exercised by the Communist Party, but it was now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on May 4, 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, [[Pristina]], in March 1981, when Albanian students rioted over long queues in their university canteen. This seemingly trivial dispute rapidly spread throughout Kosovo and took on the character of a national revolt, with massive popular demonstrations in many Kosovo towns.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The protesters demanded that Kosovo should become the seventh republic of Yugoslavia.

However, this was politically unacceptable to Serbia and the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. Some Serbs (and possibly some Albanian nationalists as well) saw the demands as being a prelude to a "[[Greater Albania]]" which could encompass parts of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and Kosovo itself. The Communist Yugoslav presidency quelled the disturbances by sending in riot police and the army, and proclaiming a state of emergency, although it did not repeal the province's autonomy as some Serbian Communists demanded. The Yugoslav press reported that about 11 people had been killed (although others claimed a death toll as high as 1,000) and another 4,200 were imprisoned. Kosovo's Communist Party also suffered purges, with several key figures (including its president) expelled.

Hardliners instituted a fierce crackdown on nationalism of all kinds, Albanian and Serbian alike. Kosovo endured a heavy secret police presence throughout most of the 1980s that ruthlessly suppressed any unauthorized nationalist manifestations, both Albanian and Serbian. According to a report quoted by [[Mark Thompson]], as many as 580,000 inhabitants of Kosovo were arrested, interrogated, interned, or reprimanded. Thousands of these lost their jobs or were expelled from their educational establishments. During this time, tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities continued to escalate.

In 1969, the Serbian [[Orthodox Church]] had ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of Serbs in Kosovo, seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the Serbian faithful. In February 1982, a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask "why the Serbian Church is silent" and why it did not campaign against "the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo". Such concerns did attract interest in Belgrade. Stories appeared from time to time in the Belgrade media claiming that Serbs and Montenegrins were being persecuted. There was a perception among Serbian nationalists that Serbs were being driven out of Kosovo. A significant fact contributing to fear and instability was large-scale drug trafficking by mafias of Kosovo Albanians.

In addition to all this, the worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when employing new recruits, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. To that end, it is believed that a large number of those declaring Albanian ethnicity are in fact from the Roma community who happen to be of Islamic faith. Kosovo was the poorest part of Yugoslavia: the average [[per capita income]] was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635 (and $5,315 in Slovenia).

Riots
</heading>
<text>

In 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to Central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several deaths of Serbs and desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards.<ref>The Associated Press-October 17, 1981 "Minorities Leaving Yugoslav Province Dominated by Albanians"</ref> In 1982 It was concluded that the Serbs were victims of major prejudice and harassment, several murders had been committed by ethnic Albanians, and forming of serious nationalist groups was reality. 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by the Yugoslav Police who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material.<ref>Financial Times (London)February 5, 1982-"Police fail to crush resistance in Kosovo"</ref> An estimated 20,000+ Serbs had moved from Kosovo since the riots until the end of 1982. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In the summer of 1986, 40 attacks on Serbs in only 2 months were documented.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 1987 David Binder wrote a report on [[The New York Times]] about rising nationalism among Albanians in Kosovo. In his report he tells about [[Paracin massacre]], where an Albanian soldier killed 4 soldiers and wounded 5 in a JNA barracks.<ref name=NYDB>[[The New York Times]], November 1, 1987, Late City Final Edition (p.14) -"[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/in-yugoslavia-rising-ethnic-strife-brings-fears-of-worse-civil-conflict.html In Yugoslavia, Rising Ethnic Strife Brings Fears of Worse Civil Conflict] By David Binder</ref>

The report quoting Federal Secretary for National Defense, Fleet Adm. Branko Mamula, shows that from 1981–1987, 216 illegal Albanian organizations with 1,435 members were discovered in the JNA. They had prepared the mass killings of officers and soldiers, poisoning food and water, sabotage, breaking in and stealing weapons and ammunition.<ref name=NYDB/>

In Kosovo, growing [[Albanian nationalism]] and separatism led to tensions between Serbs and Albanians. An increasingly poisonous atmosphere led to wild rumors being spread around and otherwise trivial incidents being blown out of proportion.

It was against this tense background that the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU, from its Serbian initials, САНУ) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm|title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija|year=2000|published=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|author=Ruza Petrovic, Marina Blagojevic}}</ref> The report concluded that a considerable part of those who had left had been under pressure by Albanians to do so.

Sixteen prominent members of the SANU began work in June 1985 on a draft document that was leaked to the public in September 1986. The [[SANU Memorandum]], as it has become known, was hugely controversial. It focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside Serbia proper.

The Memorandum paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the province's Serbs were being subjected to "physical, political, legal and cultural genocide" in an "open and total war" that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the Nazi occupation or the First World War occupation of Serbia by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]]. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous twenty years and warned that there would soon be none left "unless things change radically." The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for "genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established" and "objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created." It concluded that "Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past."

The SANU Memorandum met with many different reactions. The Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at a local level. They claimed that all Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons. Other Yugoslav nationalities, notably the Slovenes and Croats, saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs themselves were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official [[Slobodan Milošević]].

In November 1988, Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989, Milošević announced an "[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]" in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen). Milošević and his government claimed that the constitutional changes were necessary to protect Kosovo's remaining Serbs against harassment from the Albanian majority.

[[File:General Wesley Clark official photograph, edited.jpg|thumb|[[Wesley Clark]] served as the [[SACEUR#Supreme_Allied_Commander_Europe_.28SACEUR.29|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]].]]
Slobodan Milošević took the process of retrenchment a stage further in 1990 when he revoked the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina and replaced locally chosen leaders with his sympathizers. Crucially, as both provinces had a vote in the eight member Yugoslav Presidency, this gave Milosevic an automatic four votes when combined with Serbia and Montenegro (which was closely allied to Serbia). [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] thus had to maintain an uneasy alliance to prevent Milošević from driving through constitutional changes. Serbia's political changes were ratified in a July 5, 1990 [[referendum]] across the entire republic of Serbia, including Kosovo. As a result of these measures more than 80,000 Kosovo Albanians were expelled from their state jobs in Kosovo. A new Serb curriculum was imposed in all higher education in Kosovo, a move which was rejected by Albanians who responded by creating their parallel education system.

The impact on Kosovo was drastic. The reduction of its autonomy was accompanied by the abolition of its political institutions (including the [[League of Communists of Kosovo]]); its assembly and government were formally disbanded. As most of Kosovo's industry was state-owned, the changes brought a wholesale change of corporate cadres. Technically, few were sacked outright: their companies required them to sign loyalty pledges, which most Albanians would not sign, although a few did and remained employed in Serbian state companies right up to 1999.

Albanian cultural autonomy was also drastically reduced. The only Albanian-language newspaper, ''Rilindja'', was banned, and TV and radio broadcasts in Albanian ceased. Albanian was no longer an official language of the province. The [[University of Pristina]], seen as a hotbed of [[Albanian nationalism]], was purged: 800 lecturers at Pristina University were sacked and 22,500 of the 23,000 students expelled. Some 40,000 Yugoslav troops and police replaced the original Albanian-run security forces. A punitive regime was imposed that was harshly condemned as a "[[police state]]". Poverty and unemployment reached catastrophic levels, with about 80% of Kosovo's population becoming unemployed. As many as a third of adult male Albanians chose to go abroad (particularly to [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]) to find work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

With Kosovo's Communist Party effectively broken up by Milošević's crackdown, the dominant Albanian political party position passed to the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]], led by the writer [[Ibrahim Rugova]]. It responded to the abolition of Kosovo's autonomy by pursuing a policy of peaceful resistance. Rugova took the very practical line that armed resistance would be futile given Serbia's military strength and would lead only to a bloodbath in the province. He called on the Albanian populace to boycott the Yugoslav and Serbian states by not participating in any elections, by ignoring the [[military draft]] (compulsory in Yugoslavia), and most important, by not paying any taxes or duties to the State. He also called for the creation of parallel Albanian schools, clinics, and hospitals. In September 1991, the shadow Kosovo Assembly organized a [[referendum]] on independence for Kosovo. Despite widespread harassment and violence by Serbian security forces, the referendum achieved a reported 90% turnout among the province's Albanians, and a 98% vote&mdash;nearly a million votes in all&mdash;which approved the creation of an independent "Republic of Kosovo". In May 1992, a second referendum elected Rugova as President of Kosovo. The Serbian government declared that both referendums were illegal, and their results null and void.

{{Kosovo War}}
{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}
Rugova's policy of passive resistance succeeded in keeping Kosovo quiet during the war with [[Slovenia]], and the wars in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] during the early 1990s. However, as evidenced by the emergence of the KLA, this came at the cost of increasing frustration among Kosovo's Albanian population. In the mid-1990s, Rugova pleaded for a [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force for Kosovo. In 1997, Milošević was promoted to the presidency of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (comprising Serbia and Montenegro since its inception in April 1992).

Continuing Serbian repression had radicalized many Albanians, some of whom decided that only armed resistance would change the situation. On April 22, 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in several parts of Kosovo. A hitherto-unknown organization calling itself the "[[Kosovo Liberation Army]]" (KLA) subsequently claimed responsibility. The nature of the KLA was at first highly mysterious.

It is widely believed that the KLA received financial and material support from the Kosovo Albanian diaspora.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.kosovo.net/judah2.html | title = Kosovo: Peace Now | publisher = kosovo.net, originally from b92.net | author = Tim Judah | date = 1999-08-12 | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}</ref><ref name="interpol"/> In early 1997, [[Albania]] collapsed into chaos following the fall of President [[Sali Berisha]]. Military stockpiles were looted with impunity by criminal gangs, with much of the hardware ending up in western Kosovo and boosting the growing KLA arsenal. [[Bujar Bukoshi]], shadow Prime Minister in exile (in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]]), created a group called [[FARK]] ([[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosova]]) which was reported to have been disbanded and absorbed by the KLA in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Yugoslav government considered the KLA "[[terrorists]]" and "[[insurgents]]", attacking police and civilians, while most Albanians saw the KLA as "[[freedom fighters]]".

In 1998, the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization,<ref name="interpol">{{Cite web| url = http://judiciary.house.gov/Legacy/muts1213.htm | title = The Threat Posed by the Convergence of Organized Crime, Drugs Trafficking and Terrorism. | author = written Testimony of Ralf Mutschke Assistant Director, Criminal Intelligence Directorate International Criminal Police Organization&nbsp;— Interpol General Secretariat before a hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime | publisher = U.S. House Judiciary Committee | date = 2000-12-13 | accessdate = 2008-05-31 | quote = In 1998, the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization}}</ref> and in 1999 the Republican Policy Committee of the [[U.S. Senate]] expressed its troubles with the "effective alliance" of the Clinton administration with the KLA due to "numerous reports from reputable unofficial sources ".<ref name="senate"/>

In 2000, a [[BBC]] article stated that [[Nato at War]] shows how the United States, which had described the KLA as "terrorist", now sought to form a relationship with it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/674056.stm|title=Behind the Kosovo crisis|author=Allan Little|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2000-03-12}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the U.S. held an "outer wall of sanctions" on Yugoslavia which had been tied to a series of issues, Kosovo being one of them. These were maintained despite the agreement at Dayton to end all sanctions. The Clinton administration claimed that Dayton bound Yugoslavia to hold discussions with Rugova over Kosovo.

The crisis escalated in December 1997 at the Peace Implementation Council meeting in Bonn, where the International Community (as defined in the [[Dayton Agreement]]) agreed to give the High Representative in Bosnia sweeping powers, including the right to dismiss elected leaders. At the same time, Western diplomats insisted that Kosovo be discussed, and that Serbia and Yugoslavia be responsive to Albanian demands there. The delegation from Serbia stormed out of the meetings in protest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

This was followed by the return of the Contact Group that oversaw the last phases of the Bosnian conflict and declarations from European powers demanding that Serbia solve the problem in Kosovo.

KLA attacks suddenly intensified, centered on the [[Drenica]] valley area, with the compound of one [[Adem Jashari]] being a particular focal point. Days after Robert Gelbard described the KLA as a terrorist group, Serbian police responded to the KLA attacks in the [[Likosane]] area, and pursued some of the KLA to Cirez, resulting in the deaths of 30 Albanian civilians and four Serbian policemen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/koschron.pdf|format=PDF|title=Kosovo Chronology: From 1997 to the end of the conflict|month=June|year=1999|publisher=[[British Parliament]]}}</ref> The first serious action of the war had begun.

Despite some accusations of summary executions and killings of civilians, condemnations from Western capitals were not as voluble as they would become later. Serb police began to pursue Jashari and his followers in the village of [[Donje Prekaz]]. A massive firefight at the Jashari compound led to the massacre of 60 Albanians, of which eighteen were women and ten were under the age of sixteen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hrw.org/campaigns/kosovo98/timeline.shtml|title=Kosovo War Crimes Chronology|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref> This March 5 event provoked massive condemnation from the western capitals. [[Madeleine Albright]] stated that "this crisis is not an internal affair of the FRY".

On March 24, Serbian forces surrounded the village of Glodjane, in the Dukagjin operational zone, and attacked a rebel compound there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&s=f&o=235663&apc_state=henitri2005|title=Ramush Haradinaj|author=Stacy Sullivan|date=2005-03-11|publisher=[[IWPR]]}}</ref> Despite their superior firepower, the Serbian forces failed to destroy the KLA unit which had been their objective. Although there were deaths and severe injuries on the Albanian side, the insurgency in [[Glodjane]] was far from stamped out. It was in fact to become one of the strongest centers of resistance in the upcoming war.

Northern Albania served as another center of KLA activity, centered in the town of [[Tropojë]]. Following the 1997 Albanian civil conflict, parts of Albania ended up beyond the reach of national authorities. Moreover, the Albanian army's armories were looted. Many of these looted weapons ended up in the hands of the KLA whilst the KLA took over the border area. This was a staging ground for attacks and for shipping weapons to the Drenica stronghold. The path between these areas crossed Đakovica, the plains of [[Metohija]], and to the Klina opstina, and were those areas hardest hit by KLA activity in the beginning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The KLA's first goal was thus to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, and this would shape the first few months of the fighting.

The Serbs also continued their efforts at diplomacy, attempting to arrange talks with Ibrahim Rugova's staff (talks which Rugova and his staff refused to attend). After several failed meetings, Ratko Marković, chairman of the Serbian delegation to the meetings, invited representatives of Kosovo minority groups to attend while maintaining his invitation to the Albanians. Serbian President [[Milan Milutinović]] attended one of the meetings, though Rugova did not. He and his staff insisted on talking to Yugoslav officials, not ''Serbian'' ones, and only to discuss the modalities of Kosovo independence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

A new Serbian government was also formed at this time, led by the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and the [[Serbian Radical Party]]. Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman [[Vojislav Šešelj]] became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with Serbia's position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.

In early April, Serbia arranged for a referendum on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in this crisis. Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around [[Dečani]] and ran a territory based in the village of Glođane, encompassing its surroundings. So, on May 31, 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, an air show over the Yugoslav borders.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/determined_falcon.htm</ref>

During this time, the Yugoslav President Milošević reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who, through this whole crisis, refused to talk to the Serbian side, but not the Yugoslav. In fact, the only meeting between Milošević and Ibrahim Rugova took place on May 15 in Belgrade, two days after [[Richard Holbrooke]] announced that it would take place. One month later, Holbrooke, after a trip to Belgrade where he threatened Milošević that if he did not obey, "what's left of your country will implode", he visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June; there he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathizers, and to observers in general, that the U.S. was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.

The Yeltsin agreement included Milošević's allowing international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo-Metohija to monitor the situation there. This was the [[Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission]] (KDOM) that began operations in early July. The American government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the Americans demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire "without linkage...to a cessation in terrorist activities".

All through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. KLA surrounded [[Peć]], [[Đakovica]], and had set up an interim capital in the town of [[Mališevo]] (north of [[Orahovac]]). The KLA troops infiltrated [[Suva Reka]], and the northwest of Priština. They moved on to the Belacevec coal pits and captured them in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on guerrilla and mountain warfare, and harassing and ambushing Serb forces and police patrols.

The tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Orahovac. On July 17, 1998, two close-by villages to Orahovac, Retimlije and Opteruša, were also captured. Similar, even if less systematic events took place in the town of Orahovac and the larger Serb village of Velika hoċa. The Orthodox monastery of Zociste 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) from Orehovac&mdash;famous for the relics of the Saints Kosmas and Damianos and revered also by local Albanians&mdash;was robbed, its monks deported to a KLA prison camp, and, while empty, the monastery church and all its buildings were leveled to the ground by mining. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.

A new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo south of the Priština-Peć road. This wound down with the capture of [[Klecka]] on August 23 and the discovery of a KLA-run crematorium in which some of their victims were found. The KLA began an offensive on September 1 around [[Prizren]], causing Yugoslavian military activity there. In [[Metohija]], around [[Peć]], another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.

In early mid-September, for the first time, some KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around [[Podujevo]]. Finally, in late September, a determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley itself. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, however, the threats intensified once again but a galvanizing event was needed. They got it on September 28, when the mutilated corpses of a family were discovered by KDOM outside the village of [[Gornje Obrinje]]; the bloody doll from there became the rallying image for the ensuing war.

The other major issue for those who saw no option but to resort to the use of force was the estimated 250,000 displaced Albanians, 30,000 of whom were out in the woods, without warm clothing or shelter, with winter fast approaching.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador to the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Christopher R. Hill|Christopher Hill]], was leading shuttle diplomacy between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. It was these meetings which were shaping what was to be the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo.

During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. All was ready for the bombs to fly; Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milošević with regards to deploying a NATO presence in Kosovo. He was accompanied by General [[Michael Short]], who threatened to destroy Belgrade. Long and painful discussions led to the Kosovo Verification Agreement on October 12, 1998.

[[File:T-55 next to an OSCE vehicle in Kosovo.jpg|thumb|250px|Yugoslav T-55A tank next to an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] vehicle]]

Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that the Serbs end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Moreover, attempts were made to persuade Milošević to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement. A ceasefire was brokered, commencing on October 25, 1998. It featured the [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] (KVM), which was a large contingent of unarmed [[OSCE]] peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo. Their inadequacy was evident from the start. They were nicknamed the "clockwork oranges" in reference to their brightly coloured vehicles (in English, a "clockwork orange" signifies a useless object.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}) The ceasefire broke down within a matter of weeks and fighting resumed in December 1998 after the KLA occupied bunkers overlooking the strategic Priština-Podujevo highway, not long after the [[Panda Bar Massacre]], when the KLA shot up a cafe in Peć. The KLA also allegedly assassinated the mayor of [[Kosovo Polje]].

The January to March 1999 phase of the war brought increasing insecurity in urban areas, including bombings and murders. Such attacks took place during the Rambouillet talks in February and as the Kosovo Verification Agreement unraveled in March. Killings on the roads continued and increased. There were military confrontations in, among other places, the [[Vučitrn]] area in February and the heretofore unaffected [[Kačanik]] area in early March.

Račak Massacre

{{Main|Račak Massacre}}

{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}
The Račak incident, which involved the killing of 45 Albanians by Serbian troops on January 15, 1999, was the culmination of the KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals that had continued throughout the winter of 1998–1999. The incident was immediately (before the investigation) condemned as a massacre by the [[Western countries]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]], and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milošević and his top officials. The details of what happened at Račak were revealed shortly after Serb paramilitaries left the scene of the massacre. Rolling TV cameras featured United States Ambassador [[William Walker (diplomat)|William Walker]] walking through mutilated bodies of Albanians. Shortly after that he held a press conference where he stated that he had just witnessed Serbian crimes against civilians.<ref>[http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/security/archive/1999/january/ds1127.htm]</ref> The massacre was the turning point of the war. [[NATO]] decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides. A carefully coordinated set of diplomatic initiatives was announced simultaneously on January 30, 1999:
* NATO issued a statement announcing that it was prepared to launch air strikes against Yugoslav targets "to compel compliance with the demands of the international community and [to achieve] a political settlement". While this was most obviously a threat to the Milošević government, it also included a coded threat to the Albanians: any decision would depend on the "position and actions of the Kosovo Albanian leadership and all Kosovo Albanian armed elements in and around Kosovo."
* The Contact Group issued a set of "non-negotiable principles" which made up a package known as "Status Quo Plus"&mdash;effectively the restoration of Kosovo's pre-1990 autonomy within Serbia, plus the introduction of democracy and supervision by international organizations. It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the [[Château de Rambouillet]], outside [[Paris]].

The Rambouillet Conference (January–March 1999)
</heading>
<text>

The [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] began on February 6, 1999, with [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]] [[Javier Solana]] negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by February 19. The Serbian delegation was led by then president of Serbia [[Milan Milutinović]], while Milošević himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton conference]] that ended war in Bosnia, where Milošević negotiated in person. The absence of Milošević was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Serbia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Artemije]] traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time speculation about an indictment for Milošević for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear for arrest.
[[File:72nd equipment 1999.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Equipment of 72nd Special Brigade [[Yugoslav Army (FRY)|Yugoslav Army]] in Kosovo War 1999 year.]]
The first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on February 23, 1999 that the negotiations "have led to a ''consensus'' on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system". They went on to say that "a political framework is now in place", leaving the further work of finalizing "the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the ''invited international'' civilian and military presence in Kosovo". During the next month, however, NATO, under the influence of US diplomats Rubin and Albright, sought to impose a forced, as opposed to invited, military presence. The tilting of NATO towards the KLA organization is chronicled in the BBC Television "Moral Combat: NATO at War" program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/panorama/transcripts/transcript_12_03_00.txt|title=Moral Combat:NATO at War|author=Allan Little|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2000-03-12}}</ref> This happened despite the fact, quoting General [[Klaus Naumann]] (Chairman of NATO Military Committee), that "Ambassador Walker stated in the NAC (North Atlantic Council) that the majority of [ceasefire] violations was caused by the KLA".

In the end, on March 18, 1999, the Albanian, American, and British delegations signed what became known as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet Accords]] while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo, an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo, and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. These latter provisions were much the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the [[SFOR]] (Stabilization Force) mission there.

While the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Serbs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even the [[Russia]]ns (traditional allies of the Serbs) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking "the will of the people [of Kosovo]" in determining the final status of the province.

Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet.

In the week before the start of NATO bombing, [[Arkan]] appeared at the [[Hyatt]] hotel in Belgrade where most of [[Western World|Western]] journalists were staying and ordered all of them to leave Serbia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,22121,00.html|title=Serbs Unplug CNN|author=Tony Karon|publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]''|date=1999-03-25}}</ref>

The international monitors from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] withdrew on March 22, for fear of the monitors' safety ahead of the anticipated NATO bombing campaign. On March 23, the Serbian assembly accepted the principle of autonomy for Kosovo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serbia-info.com/news/1999-03/24/10030.html|title=Conclusions of Serbian parliament|publisher=[[Government of Serbia]]|date=1999-03-24}}</ref> and non-military part of the agreement. But the Serbian side had objections to the military part of the Rambouillet agreement, particularly appendix B that foresees free access to all of Serbia for NATO troops,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html|title=Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo|publisher=[[U.S. State Department]]}}</ref> which it characterized as "NATO occupation". The full document was described as "fraudulent" because the military part of the agreement was offered only at the very end of the talks without much possibility for negotiation, and because the other side, condemned in harshest terms as a "separatist–terrorist delegation", completely refused to meet delegation of FRY and negotiate directly during the Rambouillet talks at all. The following day, March 24, NATO bombing began.

NATO's bombing campaign lasted from March 22 to June 11, 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in [[Italy]] and aircraft carriers stationed in the [[Adriatic]]. [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. All of the NATO members were involved to some degree&mdash;with the exception of Greece. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the German Air Force (''[[Luftwaffe]]''), it was the first time it had participated in a conflict since World War II.

The proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as "[[Serbs]] out, peacekeepers in, refugees back". That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defenses and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milošević's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was more than just a pin-prick, it was nowhere near the concentrated bombardments seen in Baghdad in 1991. On the ground, the ethnic cleansing campaign by the Serbians was stepped up and within a week of the war starting, over 300,000 Kosovo Albanians had fled into neighboring Albania and the Republic of Macedonia, with many thousands more displaced within Kosovo. By April, the United Nations was reporting that 850,000 people, mostly Albanians, had fled their homes.

NATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was, however, heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. [[Montenegro]] was bombed on several occasions but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, [[Milo Đukanović|Đukanović]]. So-called "[[dual-use]]" targets, of use to both civilians and the military, were attacked, including bridges across the [[Danube]], factories, power stations, schools, houses, nurseries, hospitals, telecommunications facilities and ,controversially, the headquarters of [[Yugoslavian Leftists]], a political party led by Milošević's wife, and the Serbian state television broadcasting tower. Some saw these actions as violations of international law and the [[Geneva Conventions]] in particular. NATO, however, argued that these facilities were potentially useful to the Yugoslav military and that their bombing was therefore justified.

At the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee [[convoy]], believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people. NATO admitted its mistake five days later, but the Serbs accused NATO of deliberately attacking the refugees. On May 7, [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade]], killing three Chinese journalists and outraging Chinese public opinion. NATO claimed they were firing at Yugoslav positions. The United States and NATO later apologized for the bombing, saying that it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the [[CIA]]. This was challenged by a joint report from ''[[The Observer]]'' (UK) and ''[[Politiken]]'' ([[Denmark]]) newspapers<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,203214,00.html|title=Nato bombed Chinese deliberately|author=John Sweeney, Jens Holsoe, Ed Vulliamy|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1999-10-17 | location=London}}</ref> which claimed that NATO intentionally bombed the embassy because it was being used as a relay station for Yugoslav army radio signals. The bombing strained relations between China and NATO countries, and provoked angry demonstrations outside Western embassies in [[Beijing]].

In another major incident at the [[Dubrava]] prison in Kosovo, the Yugoslav government attributed 85 civilian deaths to NATO bombing. [[Human Rights Watch]] research in Kosovo determined that an estimated eighteen prisoners were killed by NATO bombs on May 21 (three prisoners and a guard were killed in an earlier attack on May 19).

By the start of April, the conflict seemed little closer to a resolution and NATO countries began to think seriously about a ground operation&mdash;an invasion of Kosovo. This would have to be organized very quickly, as there was little time before winter would set in and much work would have to be done to improve the roads from the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Albania]]n ports to the envisaged invasion routes through [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and northeastern Albania. U.S. President Bill Clinton was, however, extremely reluctant to commit American forces for a ground offensive. Instead, Clinton authorized a [[CIA]] operation to look into methods to destabilize the Serbian government without training KLA troops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9905/24/kosovo.01/|title=CIA reportedly authorized to develop ways to 'destabilize' Yugoslavian government|work=CNN.com|author=Walter Rodgers, Carl Rochelle and Matthew Chance|date=1999-05-24|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref> At the same time, [[Finland|Finnish]] and [[Russia]]n negotiators continued to try to persuade Milošević to back down. He finally recognised that NATO was serious in its resolve to end the conflict one way or another and that Russia would not intervene to defend Serbia despite Moscow's strong anti-NATO rhetoric. Faced with little alternative, Milošević accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish–Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.

The Norwegian special forces [[Hærens Jegerkommando]] and [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] cooperated with the KLA in gathering intelligence information. Preparing for the invasion on June 12, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces sat together with the KLA on the Ramno mountain on the border between Macedonia and Kosovo and had an excellent scouting point for what was happening inside Kosovo. Together with British special forces, Norwegian special forces were the first to cross over the border into Kosovo. According to Keith Graves with the television network Sky News, the Norwegians were already inside Kosovo two days prior to the marching in of other forces and were among the first to enter into Pristina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=8665264|title=UCK hjalp norsk spesialstyrke|work=NTB|author=Lise Åserud and Gunnar Nyquist|date=1999-06-21|accessdate=2008-10-08|language = Norwegian}}</ref> The Hærens Jegerkommando's and Forsvarets Spesialkommando's job was to clean the way between the striding parties and to make local deals to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article254448.ece?service=print|title=Norway has forces in Afghanistan|work=Aftenposten English Web Desk|author=Nina Berglund|date=2002-01-08|accessdate=2008-10-08}} (Mentions work in Kosovo / Pristina)</ref><ref>{{Cite book| author =Tom Bakkeli|title=Norges Hemmelige Krigere / Norway's secret Warriors | isbn = 9788248907220 | language = Norwegian |work = Kagge Forlag | year = 2007| accessdate = 2008-10-08}}</ref>

On June 3, 1999 Milošević capitulated and accepted peace conditions.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9906/03/kosovo.peace.04/ | work=CNN | title=Milosevic accepts peace plan, Finnish envoy says | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://nytimes.com/1999/06/04/opinion/the-kosovo-peace-plan.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Kosovo Peace Plan | date=June 4, 1999 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On June 12, after Milošević accepted the conditions, [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] began entering Kosovo. KFOR, a NATO force, had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the [[Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps|Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General [[Mike Jackson]] of the [[British Army]]. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a [[French Army]] Brigade, a [[German Army]] brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and [[Italian Army]] and [[United States Army]] brigades. The U.S. contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the 1st Armored Division which was spearheaded by a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attached to the British Forces. Subordinate units included TF 1-35 Armor from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] from [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the U.S. force was the [[Greek Army]]'s 501st Mechanized Infantry Battalion. The initial U.S. forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future [[Camp Bondsteel]], and Gnjilane, at [[Camp Monteith]], and spent four months&mdash;the start of a stay which continues to date&mdash;establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

During the initial incursion, the U.S. soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as U.S. soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages. Although no resistance was met, three U.S. soldiers from the Initial Entry Force lost their lives in accidents.<ref>Sergeant William Wright&nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Specialist Sherwood Brim&nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers(17 July 1999); Private First Class Benjamin McGill&nbsp;— C Company 1st Battalion 26th Infantry (5 August 1995).</ref>

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from [[Bosnia]] and seized the [[Pristina International Airport]].

In 2010 [[James Blunt]] in an interview described how his unit was given the assignment of securing the Pristina in advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit's arrival. As the first officer on the scene, Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account, verified by [[General Sir Mike Jackson]], there was a stand-off with the Russians, and the NATO Supreme Commander, US [[General Wesley Clark]], gave orders to over-power them. Whilst these were questioned by Blunt, they were rejected by [[General Sir Mike Jackson]] with the now famous line, "I'm not having my soldiers responsible for starting World War III".<ref>{{cite news |title= Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2010}}</ref>

Furthermore, in June 2000, arms trading relations between Russia and Serbia were exposed which lead to the retaliation and bombings of Russian Checkpoints and area Police Stations. [[Outpost Gunner]] was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of 2/3 Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.<ref name="bbc-airport">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/671495.stm|title=Confrontation over Pristina airport|accessdate=2008-02-08|date=2000-03-09|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

Reaction to the war
</heading>
<text>

The [[Legitimacy of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|legitimacy of NATO's bombing campaign]] in Kosovo has been the subject of much debate. One immediate cause of this criticism was the timing of the NATO intervention, coming as it did on the heels of the [[Monica Lewinski scandal]] which led many critics to suspect that the intervention was an opportunistic attempt to distract the American public from the same (references to the film [[Wag the Dog]] were a polite way to refer to this suspicion). Some support for this hypothesis may be found in the fact that coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]] in American news cycles.<ref name="Foerstel">[http://books.google.com/books?id=HorHFYH0NsoC&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=Who+tied+the+lewinski+scandal+to+the+Kosovo+war?&source=bl&ots=fbLzfRczrr&sig=MkE8rIfEEy2EyPqFuwngtmSojxs&hl=en&ei=qx47TYXbKY36swOA_bzVAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false], From Watergate to Monicagate: ten controversies in modern journalism and media
 By Herbert N. Foerstel, pg 131-135.</ref> Still others point out that before the bombing, rather than being an unusually bloody conflict, the war between the KLA and the Yugoslav security forces had in fact been one of the cleanest civil wars in modern history whereas the humanitarian toll skyrocketed among all concerned (including ethnic Albanians) after the NATO intervention.<ref name="Foerstel" /> Perhaps more importantly NATO did not have the backing of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. NATO argued that their defiance of the Security Council was justified based on the claims of an "international humanitarian emergency". Criticism was also drawn by the fact that the NATO charter specifies that NATO is an organization created for defense of its members, but in this case it was used to attack a non-NATO country which was not directly threatening any NATO member. NATO claimed that instability in the [[Balkans]] was a direct threat to the security interests of NATO members, and military action was therefore justified by the NATO charter; however, the only NATO member country to which the instability was a direct threat was [[Greece]], which opposed the bombing.

Many on the left of Western politics saw the NATO campaign as U.S. aggression and imperialism, while critics on the right considered it irrelevant to their countries' national security interests. [[Noam Chomsky]],<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/199906140008 Is this really a grand NATO victory?], Noam Chomsky, New Statesman, June 14, 1999</ref> [[Edward Said]], [[Justin Raimondo]], and [[Tariq Ali]] were prominent in opposing the campaign. However, in comparison with the anti-war protests against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the campaign against the war in Kosovo aroused much less public support.

The personalities were also very different&mdash;the NATO nations were mostly led by centre-left and moderately liberal leaders, most prominently U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]], German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and the Italian Prime Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]]. Anti-war protests were generally from the libertarian right, the left, far-left and Serbian émigrés, with many other left-wingers supporting the campaign on humanitarian grounds. The German participation in the operation was one of the reasons for [[Oskar Lafontaine]]'s resignation from the post of Federal Minister of Finance and the chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].

There was, however, criticism from all parts of the political spectrum for the way that NATO conducted the campaign. NATO officials sought to portray it as a "clean war" using [[Precision-guided munition|precision weapons]]. The U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] claimed that, up to June 2, 99.6% of the 20,000 bombs and missiles used had hit their targets. However, the use of technologies such as [[depleted uranium ammunition]] and [[cluster bombs]] was highly controversial, as was the bombing of oil refineries and chemical plants, which led to accusations of "environmental warfare". The slow pace of progress during the war was also heavily criticised. Many believed that NATO should have mounted an all-out campaign from the start, rather than starting with a relatively small number of strikes and combat aircraft.

Targets of the NATO bombing campaign

<text>

[[File:Bombing of Zastava factory.jpg|thumb|250px|Post-strike bomb damage assessment photograph of the [[Kragujevac]] Armor and Motor Vehicle Plant Crvena Zastava, Serbia]]

The choice of targets was highly controversial. The destruction of bridges over the Danube greatly disrupted shipping on the river for months afterwards, causing serious economic damage to countries along the length of the river. Industrial facilities were also attacked, damaging the economies of many towns. In fact, as the Serbian opposition later complained, the Yugoslav military was using civilian factories as weapons plants: the Sloboda vacuum cleaner factory in the town of [[Čačak]] also housed a tank repair facility, while the [[Zastava]] car plant was wrongly bombed, because the weapons factory of the same name exists in the same city, but in a completely different location. There were more similar mistakes that showed a lack of intelligence services.

Only state-owned factories were targeted, leading critics to suspect that the bombing campaign was partly designed to prepare the way for a free market-based reconstruction by wealthy foreign powers.<ref>{{Cite web|author=John Pilger|date=2004-12-13|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200412130010|title=John Pilger reminds us of Kosovo}}</ref> No private or foreign-owned industrial sites were bombed. Perhaps the most controversial deliberate attack of the war was that made against the headquarters of Serbian television on April 23, which killed at least fourteen people. NATO justified the attack on the grounds that the Serbian television headquarters was part of the Milošević regime's "propaganda machine". Opponents of Milošević inside Serbia charged that the managers of the state TV station had been forewarned of the attack but ordered staff to remain inside the building despite an air raid alert.

Within Yugoslavia, opinion on the war was (unsurprisingly) split between highly critical among Serbs and highly supportive among Albanians, although not all Albanians felt that way; some appear to have blamed NATO for not acting quickly enough. Although Milošević was increasingly unpopular, the NATO campaign created a mood of national unity. Milošević did not leave matters entirely to chance, however. Many opposition supporters feared for their lives, particularly after the murder of the dissident journalist [[Slavko Curuvija]] on April 11, an act widely blamed on Milošević's secret police. In Montenegro, President Milo Đukanović, who opposed both the NATO bombardment and Serbian actions in Kosovo, publicly expressed fear of a "creeping [[coup d'état|coup]]" by Milošević supporters.

Opinion in Yugoslavia's neighbours was much more mixed. [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] was the only Yugoslav republic apart from Montenegro not to have fought a war with Serbia and had tense relations between the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] majority and a large Albanian minority. Its government did not approve of Milošević's actions, but it was also not very sympathetic towards the Albanian refugees. Albania was wholly supportive of NATO's actions, as might be expected given the ethnic ties between Albanians on both sides of the border. Croatia, Romania, and Bulgaria granted fly-over rights to NATO aircraft. Hungary was a new member of NATO and supported the campaign. Across the [[Adriatic]], Italian public and political opinion was against the war, but the Italian government nonetheless allowed NATO full use of Italian air bases. In Greece, popular opposition to the NATO bombing reached 96%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/mpa/1999/99-04-17.mpa.html|title=Macedonian Press Agency: News in English|date=1999-04-17}}</ref>

A number of critics have emerged since the end of the war.

Clinton also claimed, in the same press conference, that "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide."<ref>{{Cite web|author=Bill Clinton|date=1999-06-25|url=http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html|title=Press Conference by the President}}</ref> Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the [[Holocaust]]. CNN reported, "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned President Clinton sought...to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/23/u.s.kosovo.04/|title=Clinton: Serbs must be stopped now|date=1999-03-23|publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> Clinton's [[State Department]] also claimed Yugoslav troops had committed genocide. The ''New York Times'' reported, "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Yugoslav forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest yet in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević."<ref>Clines, Francis X (March 30, 1999). "NATO Hunting for Serb Forces; U.S. Reports Signs of 'Genocide'". ''The New York Times'', p. A1.</ref> The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians.

"Early Count Hints at Fewer Kosovo Deaths". ''The New York Times'', p. A6.</ref>

After the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of naked aggression, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kzNFT_7HcR4C&pg=PA148&dq=Interfere+Bosnia+internal+affairs+NATO&sig=ACfU3U2pRGEayFd2PsgXEitUtKrPdqQ2bA Brian Frderking, The United States and the Security Council]</ref>

The United Nations Charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the United Nations Security Council. The issue was brought before the UN Security Council by Russia, in a draft resolution which, ''inter alia'', would affirm "that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter". China, Namibia, and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990326.sc6659.html|date=1999-03-26|publisher=[[United Nations]]|title=Security Council Rejects Demand for Cessation of Use of Force Against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}</ref>

On April 29, 1999, Yugoslavia filed a complaint at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at [[The Hague]] against ten NATO member countries (Belgium, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Canada, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the USA). The Court did not decide upon the case because Yugoslavia was not a member of the UN during the war.

In Western European countries, opposition to NATO's intervention was mainly from the libertarian right, and from the [[far left]]. In Britain, the war was opposed by many prominent conservative figures including former [[UK Foreign Secretary]] Sir [[Malcolm Rifkind]], former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], and journalists [[Peter Hitchens]] and [[Simon Heffer]], whereas opposition on the [[left-wing politics|left]] was confined to ''[[The Morning Star]]'' newspaper and left wing MPs like [[Tony Benn]] and [[Alan Simpson (Member of Parliament)|Alan Simpson]]. In the U.S. criticism was largely limited to the conservative Republican Party, many of whom voted to approve congressional funding for the war under the premise of "supporting the troops, not the policy" of Democratic President Bill Clinton. The war was opposed primarily by prominent conservative figures in the U.S., including (then Texas Governor) George W. Bush, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom Delay and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  The more liberal Democratic Party largely supported the policy of the Democratic president, with the exception of some elements of the far-left, lead by liberal activists, like Ralph Nader.

The war inflicted many casualties. Already by March 1999, the combination of fighting and the targeting of civilians had left an estimated 1,500-2,000 civilians and combatants dead.<ref name="HRW1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-03.htm|title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref> Final estimates of the casualties are still unavailable for either side.

In June 2000, the [[Red Cross]] reported that 3,368 civilians (2,500 Albanians, 400 Serbs, and 100 Roma) were still missing, nearly one year after the conflict.<ref name="BBC-missing">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=3,000 missing in Kosovo|date=2000-06-07}}</ref> {{Clarify|date=January 2010}}

A study by researchers from the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], Georgia published in 2000 in medical journal [[the Lancet]] estimated that "12,000 deaths in the total population" could be attributed to war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.thelancet.com/pdfdownload?uid=llan.355.9222.original_research.1004.1&x=x.pdf|format=PDF|title=Casualties in Kosovo|publisher=[[The Lancet]]|date=2000-06-24}}</ref> This number was achieved by surveying 1,197 households from February 1998 through June 1999. 67 out of the 105 deaths reported in the sample population were attributed to war-related [[Physical trauma|trauma]], which extrapolates to be 12,000 deaths if the same war-related mortality rate is applied to Kosovo's total population. The highest mortality rates were in men between 15 and 49 (5,421 victims of war) as well as for men over 50 (5,176 victims). For persons younger than 15, the estimates were 160 victims for males and 200 for females.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} For women between 15-49 the estimate is that there were 510 victims; older than 50 years the estimate is 541 victims. The authors stated that it is not "possible to differentiate completely between civilian and military casualties".

In the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Center (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Person, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of 13,472 war and post-war victims in Kosovo killed in the period from January 1998 to December 2000.<ref>ENGLISH http://www.hlc-rdc.org/FHPKosovo/KOSOVO-KNJIGA-PAMCENJA/index.1.en.html</ref><ref>SERBIAN http://www.hlc-rdc.org/stranice/Linkovi-modula/Kosovska-knjiga-pamcenja.sr.html</ref><ref>SHQIP http://www.hlc-rdc.org/FHPKosovo/KOSOVO-KNJIGA-PAMCENJA/index.1.sq.html</ref> The list contained the name, date of birth, military or civilian status of victim, type of injury/missing, time and place of death.

Yugoslavia claimed that NATO attacks caused between 1,200 and 5,700 civilian casualties. NATO acknowledged killing at most 1,500 civilians. [[Human Rights Watch]] counted a minimum of 488 civilian deaths (90 to 150 of them killed from cluster bomb use) in 90 separate incidents. Attacks in Kosovo overall were more deadly&mdash;a third of the incidents account for more than half of the deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/index.htm#TopOfPage|title=Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|month=February|year=2000}}</ref>

Of military equipment, NATO destroyed around 50 Yugoslav aircraft, of which many were old and unflyable, and were intentionally placed as decoys<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lHyKv4IC3c Serb Decoys Bombed By NATO</ref> to draw attention away from valuable targets. Two notable exceptions were the 11 destroyed MiG-29s, and 6 G-4 Super Galebs which were destroyed right in their hardened aircraft shelter when someone forgot to close the shelter doors. At the end of war, NATO officially claimed they destroyed 93 Yugoslav tanks. Yugoslavia admitted a total of 13 destroyed tanks. The latter figure was verified by European inspectors when Yugoslavia rejoined the Dayton accords, by noting the difference between the number of tanks then and at the last inspection in 1995. The NATO officers claimed that Yugoslav army lost 94 tanks ([[M-84]]'s and [[T-55]]'s), 132 APCs, and 52 artillery pieces.<ref name="one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com">http://one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com/airpwr.htm</ref> Yugoslav officers claimed the real numbers were "14 tanks, not 120; 18 armored personnel carriers, not 220; 20 artillery pieces, not 450".<ref name="one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com"/><ref>"The Kosovo Cover-Up" by John Barry and Evan Thomas, ''Newsweek'', May 15, 2000.</ref> Most of the targets hit in Kosovo were decoys, such as tanks made out of plastic sheets with telegraph poles for gun barrels, or old World War II–era tanks which were not functional. Anti-aircraft defences were preserved by the simple expedient of not turning them on, preventing NATO aircraft from detecting them, but forcing them to keep above a ceiling of 15,000 feet (5,000&nbsp;m), making accurate bombing much more difficult. Civilian microwave ovens were used as E-band radar decoys against NATO loiter munitions, which were also unable to detect obsolete soviet UHF radar stations in use by Yugoslav forces. Towards the end of the war, it was claimed that carpet bombing by [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] aircraft had caused huge casualties among Yugoslav troops stationed along the Kosovo–Albania border. Careful searching by NATO investigators found no evidence of any such large-scale casualties.

However, the most significant loss for the [[Yugoslav Army]] was the damaged and destroyed infrastructure. Almost all military air bases and airfields ([[Batajnica Air Base|Batajnica]], [[Kraljevo-Lađevci Airport|Lađevci]], [[Slatina Air Base|Slatina]], [[Golubovci Air Base|Golubovci]], [[Kovin Airport|Kovin]], and [[Đakovica Airfield|Đakovica]]) and other military buildings and facilities were badly damaged or destroyed. Unlike the units and their equipment, military buildings couldn't be camouflaged. thus, defence industry and military technical overhaul facilities were also seriously damaged ([[Utva]], [[Zastava Arms]] factory, Moma Stanojlović air force overhaul center, technical overhaul centers in [[Čačak]] and [[Kragujevac]]). Moreover, in an effort to weaken the Yugoslav Army, NATO targeted several important civilian facilities ([[Pančevo]] oil refinery, bridges, TV stations, railroads, and even hospitals).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidbudbill.com/jme14.html|title=NATO BOMBS LEAVE TOXIC SLOUGH|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>

KLA losses

Kosovo Liberation Army losses are difficult to analyze. According to some reports there were around 1,000<ref name="antiwar.com">[http://antiwar.com/malic/?articleid=13083 The War Street Journal Invents Kosovo (KLA casualties)]</ref> casualties on KLA side. Difficulties arise in calculating an accurate figure. Things are complicated by the difficulty of determining who was a KLA member. For example, the Yugoslavs considered any armed Albanian to be a member of the KLA, regardless of whether he was officially a card-carrying member, so someone who is counted as a civilian by the Albanian side might be counted as a KLA combatant by the Serbs. Also, many members of the KLA were not wearing uniforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Within three weeks, over 500,000 Albanian [[refugees]] had returned home. By November 1999, according to the [[UNHCR|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]], 848,100 out of 1,108,913 had returned.

During the war, 90,000 [[Serbs in Kosovo|Serbs]] fled from Kosovo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/18/serbia8129.htm|title=Kosovo/Serbia: Protect Minorities from Ethnic Violence|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref> The Yugoslav [[Red Cross]] had also registered 247,391 mostly Serbian refugees by November. The persistent anti-Serb attacks and riots, including against other non-Albanians, had remained in the anarchic stage until some form of order was established in 2001, This order disintergrated during the 2004 progrom against non Albanians.

{{Main|Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] charged Milošević with [[crimes against humanity]], violating the [[laws or customs of war]], grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] and [[genocide]] for his role during the wars in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and Kosovo.

Before the end of the bombing, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, along with [[Milan Milutinović]], [[Nikola Šainović]], [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]] and [[Vlajko Stojiljković]] were charged by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) with crimes against humanity including murder, forcible transfer, deportation, and "persecution on political, racial or religious grounds".

Further indictments were leveled in October 2003 against former armed forces chief of staff [[Nebojša Pavković]], former army corps commander [[Vladimir Lazarević]], former police official [[Vlastimir Đorđević]], and the current head of Serbia's public security, [[Sreten Lukić]]. All were indicted for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war.

War crimes prosecutions have also been carried out in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav soldier [[Ivan Nikolić]] was found guilty in 2002 of war crimes in the deaths of two civilians in Kosovo. A significant number of Yugoslav soldiers were tried by Yugoslav military tribunals during the war.

KLA war crimes

<text>

The ICTY also leveled indictments against KLA members [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Haradin Bala]], [[Isak Musliu]], and [[Agim Murtezi]] for crimes against humanity. They were arrested on February 17 and 18, 2003. Charges were soon dropped against Agim Murtezi as a case of mistaken identity, whereas Fatmir Limaj was acquitted of all charges on November 30, 2005 and released. The charges were in relation to the prison camp run by the defendants at [[Lapusnik]] between May and July 1998.

In 2008, [[Carla Del Ponte]] published a book in which she alleged that, after the end of the war in 1999, Kosovo Albanians were smuggling organs of between 100 and 300 Serbs and other minorities from the province to Albania.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120812796372611429.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Organ smuggling in Wall Street Journal]</ref> The ICTY and the Serbian War Crimes Tribunal are currently investigating these allegations, as numerous witnesses and new materials have recently emerged.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2008/04/16/01011-20080416FILWWW00481-trafic-d-organeskosovo-aucune-trace.php Le Figaro - Flash actu : trafic d'organes/Kosovo: ''aucune trace''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On March 2005, a U.N. tribunal indicted Kosovo Prime Minister [[Ramush Haradinaj]] for war crimes against the Serbs. On March 8, he tendered his resignation. Haradinaj, an ethnic Albanian, was a former commander who led units of the Kosovo Liberation Army and was appointed Prime Minister after winning an election of 72 votes to three in the Kosovo's Parliament in December 2004. Haradinaj was acquitted on all counts. The Office of the Prosecutor has appealed his acquittal, and as of July 2008, the matter remains unresolved.

The Serbian government and a number of international pressure groups (e.g. [[Amnesty International]]) claimed that NATO had carried out war crimes during the conflict, notably the bombing of the Serbian TV headquarters in Belgrade on April 23, 1999, where 16 people were killed and 16 more were injured. Sian Jones of Amnesty stated, "The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and television was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime".<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iI-Ix5tQ59McTX8NyBF1R120X4dAD97O8IRO0 Amnesty: NATO bombing of Serbian TV 'war crime']</ref> The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] conducted an inquiry into these charges,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/nato061300.htm|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}</ref> but did not press charges, citing a lack of mandate.

{{Main|Kosovo status process|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
The Kosovo war had a number of important consequences in terms of the military and political outcome. The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine the level of autonomy Kosovo would have, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], but failed. The province is administered by the [[United Nations]] despite its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] on February 17, 2008.

[[File:Seized uniform.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Seized uniform and equipment of U.S. soldiers 1999 in Kosovo War]]

The [[UN]]-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], had begun in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm|title=UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2006-10-09}}</ref> In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes "supervised independence" for the province, which is in contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1244. By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|date=2007-06-29|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]}}</ref> Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Priština.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|date=2007-10-07|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]}}</ref>

The campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the U.S. arsenal, which were later addressed for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] campaigns. [[AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopters]] and [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never actually used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were run down to critically low levels; had the campaign lasted much longer, NATO would have had to revert back to using "dumb" bombs for lack of anything better. The situation was not any better with the combat aircraft; continuous operations meant skipped maintenance schedules and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm|title=Hundreds of crippled jets put RAF in crisis|author=Antony Barnett|date=2000-01-23}}</ref> Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with [[Global Positioning System]] satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Also, although [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless surveillance aircraft]] were extensively used, it often proved the case that attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led to the fitting of missiles to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the "sensor to shooter" time to virtually nothing.

Kosovo also demonstrated that even a high-tech force such as NATO could be thwarted by simple tactics, according to [[Wesley Clark]] and other NATO generals who analyzed these tactics a few years after the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews|title=NATO attack on Yugoslavia gave Iraq good lessons|publisher=[[Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either [[Red Army|Soviet]] or NATO, during the [[Cold War]] and had developed effective tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably effective in misleading overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:
* U.S. stealth aircraft were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors they would become visible on the radar screens. An [[F-117 Nighthawk]] was spotted in this way and downed with a missile.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
* Precision-guided missiles were often confused and unable to pinpoint radars, because radar beams were reflected off heavy farm machinery like old tractors and plows.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
* Many low-tech approaches were used to confuse heat-seeking missiles and infrared sensors. Decoys such as small gas furnaces were used to simulate nonexistent positions on mountainsides.
* Dummy targets were used very extensively. Fake bridges, airfields and decoy planes and tanks were used. Tanks were made using old tires, plastic sheeting and logs, and sand cans and fuel set alight to mimic heat emissions. They fooled NATO pilots into bombing hundreds of such decoys, though General Clark's survey found that in Operation: Allied Force, NATO airmen hit just 25 decoys&mdash;an insignificant percentage of the 974 validated hits.<ref name="fooled">{{Cite web|url=http://www.afa.org/magazine/june2000/0600kosovo.asp|month=June|year=2000|title=Nine Myths About Kosovo|author=Rebecca Grant}}</ref> However, [[NATO]] sources claim that this was due to operating procedures, which oblige troops, in this case aircraft, to engage any and all targets, however unlikely they may be. The targets needed only to look real to be shot at, if detected, of course. NATO claimed that Yugoslav air force had been decimated. "Official data show that the Yugoslav army in Kosovo lost 26 percent of its tanks, 34 percent of its APCs, and 47 percent of the artillery to the air campaign."<ref name="fooled"/>
* Old electronic jammers were used to block U.S. bombs equipped with satellite guidance.
* [[Hispano-Suiza]] anti-aircraft cannon from the [[World War II]] era was used once effectively against slow-flying drone aircraft.

As a result of the Kosovo War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation created a second NATO medal, the [[NATO Medal]] for Kosovo Service, an [[international military decoration]]. Shortly thereafter, NATO created the Non-Article 5 Medal for Balkans service to combine both Yugoslavian and Kosovo operations into one service medal.

Due to the involvement of the [[United States armed forces]], a separate [[awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]], known as the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]], was established by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.

{{Main|Literature on Kosovo}}

Kosovo, due to its strategical and historical place in the Balkans, has many sources of literature. Some of it is in Albanian due to its predominant Muslim ethnic population and the rest in other languages.  There are many books which cover the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict written by international authors. A few books worthy of mention are:
''Elegy for Kosovo'': Stories by Ismail Kadare
''From Kosovo to Kabul and Beyond'': Human Rights and International Intervention by David Chandler
''Waging Modern War'': Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Future of Combat by Wesley K. Clark
''Love Thy Neighbor'': A Story of War by Peter Maass
''The Tenth Circle of Hell'' (although about Bosnia parallels the situation in Kosovo)  by Rezak Hukanovic
''The Balkans'': Nationalism, War & the Great Powers, 1804-1999 by Misha Glenny
''Beyond the Mountains of the Damned'':  The War inside Kosovo   By McAllester, Matthew
''Madness Visible  A Memoir of War''   By Di Giovanni, Janine
and in novels
''From Bosnia with Love'' by Javed Mohammed, ''S'': A novel about the Balkans by Slavenka Drakulic.
