Finland constituted the eastern part of the [[Sweden|Swedish kingdom]] for centuries before 1809. At this time, to protect its imperial capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] conquered Finland and converted it into an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] [[buffer state]] within the Russian Empire. Finland enjoyed wide autonomy until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts [[Russification of Finland|to assimilate Finland]] as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire through [[Russification]]. While abortive because of Russia's internal strife, these attempts ruined Russia's relations with the Finns and increased support for Finnish self-determination movements.<ref name="Trotter" {{rp|4-6}}/>

The outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire gave Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland [[Finland's Declaration of Independence|declared the country's independence]]. The new [[Bolshevik]] Russian government was weak, and with the threat of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] looming Soviet Russia recognized the new Finnish government just three weeks after the declaration of independence.<ref name="Trotter" {{rp|4-6}}/> Sovereignty was fully achieved in May 1918 after a short [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] and the expulsion of Bolshevik troops.<ref name="Jow&Snod2006">[[#Jow&Snod2006|Jowett & Snodgrass (2006){{rp|3}}]]</ref>

Finland joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920. Finland sought security guarantees from the League, but its primary goal was cooperation with the [[Scandinavian countries]]. The Finnish and Swedish militaries engaged in wide-ranging cooperation, but were more focused on the exchange of information and defence planning for the [[Åland islands]] than on [[military exercise]]s, or the stockpiling and deployment of [[materiel]]. Nevertheless, the [[government of Sweden]] carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy.<ref name="Turtola1999a">[[#Turtola1999a|Turtola (1999a){{rp|21-24}}]]</ref> Another Finnish military policy was the [[top secret]] [[Finnish–Estonian defense cooperation|military cooperation]] between Finland and [[Estonia]].<ref name="Turtola1999a" {{rp|33–34}}/>

The 1920s and early 1930s were a politically unstable time in Finland. The [[Communist Party of Finland]] was declared illegal in 1931, and the far-right [[Lapua Movement]] organised anti-Communist violence, which culminated in a [[Mäntsälä Rebellion|failed uprising]] in 1932. Thereafter the ultra-nationalist [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]] (IKL) had a minor presence — at most 14 seats out of 200 in the [[Finnish parliament]].<ref name="Edwards" {{rp|26-27}}/> By the late 1930s, the export-oriented Finnish economy was growing and the country had almost solved its problems with extreme political movements.<ref name="Edwards" {{rp|18}}/>

On the left is the Finnish foreign minister [[Aarno Yrjö-Koskinen]], and on the right the ambassador of the Soviet Union, [[Ivan Maisky]].<ref name="Turtola1999a" />]]

After the Soviet involvement in the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteer forces conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Russian border: the [[Viena expedition|Viena]] and [[Aunus expedition]]s. In 1920, [[Finnish Communist Party|Finnish communists]] based in [[Soviet Russia]] attempted to assassinate the former Finnish White Guards Commander-in-Chief [[General]] [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.G.E. Mannerheim]]. On 14 October 1920 Finland and Soviet Russia signed the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]], confirming the new Finnish–Soviet border as the old border between the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and [[Imperial Russia]] proper. In addition, Finland received [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], with its [[ice-free harbour]] on the Arctic Ocean. Despite the signing of the treaty, relations between the two countries remained strained. The Finnish government allowed volunteers to cross the border to support the [[Soviet–Finnish conflict 1921–1922 and East Karelian Uprising|East Karelian Uprising]] in 1921, and Finnish communists in the Soviet Union continued to prepare for a [[Revanchism|revanche]] and staged a cross-border raid into Finland, called the "[[Pork mutiny]]," in 1922.<ref name="Turtola1999a" {{rp|30-33}}/>

In 1932, the Soviet Union signed a [[Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Finland, which was reaffirmed for a 10-year period in 1934.<ref name="Turtola1999a" {{rp|30–33}}/> However, relations between the two countries remained largely ''[[de minimis]].'' While foreign trade in Finland was [[Boom and bust|booming]], less than 1 percent of Finnish trade was with the Soviet Union.<ref name="Edwards" {{rp|31}}/> In 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|30–33}}

During the [[Stalinism|Stalin era]], Soviet propaganda painted Finland's leadership as a "vicious and reactionary Fascist clique." Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim and [[Väinö Tanner]], the leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Finnish Social Democratic Party]], were targeted for particular scorn.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|32-33}} With [[Joseph Stalin]] gaining near-absolute power through the [[Great Purge]] of 1938, the Soviet Union changed its foreign policy toward Finland in the late 1930s. The Soviet Union began pursuing the recovery of the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire had ideal security and territorial possessions, and wanted the newly christened city of [[Leningrad]] to enjoy a similar security.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|28-29}}

Negotiations
</heading>
<text>

In April 1938, an [[NKVD]] agent, [[Boris Yartsev]] contacted the Finnish foreign minister [[Rudolf Holsti]] and Prime Minister [[Aimo Cajander]], stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather "advance to meet the enemy." Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]] along the seaward approaches to Leningrad. Finland refused.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|12-13}}<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|32-33}}

Negotiations continued throughout 1938 without results. Finnish reception of Soviet entreaties was decidedly cool, as the violent collectivisation and purges in Stalin's Soviet Union resulted in a poor opinion of the country. In addition, most of the Finnish communist elite in the Soviet Union had been executed during the Great Purge, further tarnishing the Soviet Union's image in Finland. At the same time, Finland was trying to negotiate a military co-operation plan with Sweden, hoping for a joint defense of the Åland Islands.<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|34-35}}

The Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in August 1939. The pact was nominally a [[non-aggression treaty]], but it included a secret protocol in which the Eastern European countries were divided into [[spheres of interest]]. Finland fell into the Soviet sphere. On 1 September 1939, [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germany began its invasion of Poland]] and two days later Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Shortly afterwards, the Soviets [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded eastern Poland]]. The [[Baltic states]] were later [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|forced to accept treaties]] allowing the Soviets to establish military bases and to station troops on their soil.<ref name="Engle&Paan1985">[[#Engle&Paan1985|Engle and Paananen (1985)]]</ref>{{rp|6}} The government of Estonia accepted the [[ultimatum]], signing the corresponding agreement in September. [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] followed in October. Unlike the Baltic states, Finland started a gradual [[mobilisation]] under the guise of "additional [[refresher training]]."<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|38-41}}

The Soviets had already started an intensive mobilisation near the Finnish border in 1938–1939. However, assault troops necessary for invasion did not begin deployment until October 1939. Operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November.<ref name="Ries1988">[[#Ries1988|Ries (1988)]]</ref>{{rp|55-56}}<ref name="Manninen1999a">[[#Manninen1999a|Manninen (1999a)]]</ref>{{rp|141-148}}

Paasikivi, chief of staff Johan Nykopp and colonel [[Aladár Paasonen]].]]
On 5 October 1939, the Soviet Union invited a Finnish delegation to Moscow for negotiations. [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J.K. Paasikivi]], the Finnish ambassador to Sweden, was sent to Moscow to represent the Finnish government.<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|38–41}} The Soviets demanded that the border between the USSR and Finland on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] be moved westward to a point only {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} east of [[Vyborg|Viipuri]] and that the Finns destroy all existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus. They also demanded the cession of islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]] as well as the [[Kalastajansaarento peninsula]]. Furthermore, the Finns would have to lease the [[Hanko Peninsula]] for 30 years and permit the Soviets to establish a [[military base]] there. In exchange, the Soviet Union would cede two municipalities with twice the territory demanded from Finland.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|14-16}}<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|38–41}} Accepting Soviet demands would have forced the Finns to dismantle their defences in [[Finnish Karelia]].<ref name="Jow&Snod2006" />{{rp|4}}

The Soviet offer divided the Finnish government, but it was eventually rejected. On 31 October, in the assembly of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], Molotov announced Soviet demands in public. The Finns made two counteroffers whereby Finland would cede the [[Terijoki]] area to the Soviet Union, which would double the distance between Leningrad and Finnish border, far less than the Soviets had demanded.<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|41-43}} From the Soviet point of view the negotiations were finished.

Shelling of Mainila
</heading>
<text>

On 26 November, [[shelling of Mainila|a border incident]] was reported near the village of [[Mainila]]. A Soviet border guard post had been shelled by an unknown party resulting, according to Soviet reports, in the deaths of four and injuries of nine border guards. Research conducted by several Finnish and Russian historians later concluded that the shelling was carried out from the Soviet side of the border by an [[NKVD]] unit with the purpose of providing the Soviet Union with a ''[[casus belli]]'' and a pretext to withdraw from the [[Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]].<ref name="Ries1988" />{{rp|77–78}}{{#tag:ref|The Soviet role is confirmed in [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev's]] memoirs, where he states that Artillery Marshal Kulik personally supervised the bombardment of the Soviet village.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|105}}<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|44-45}}|group="F"}}

Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] claimed it was a Finnish artillery attack and demanded that Finland apologise for the incident and move its forces beyond a line 20–25 kilometres away from the border.<ref name="Tanner1950">[[#Tanner1950|Tanner (1950)]]. pp. 85–86</ref> Finland denied responsibility for the attack, rejected the demands, and called for a joint Finnish–Soviet commission to examine the incident. The Soviet Union then claimed that the Finnish response was hostile and renounced the non-aggression pact on 28 November. In the following years, [[Soviet historiography]] described the incident as a Finnish provocation. Doubt on the official Soviet version was cast only in the late 1980s, in the times of ''[[glasnost]]''. However, the issue continued to divide Russian historiography even after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="Kilin2007a">[[#Kilin2007a|Kilin (2007a)]]</ref>{{rp|99-100}}<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite web | first=Pavel | last=Aptekar' |title= Casus belli |url= http://www.rkka.ru/analys/mainila/mainila.htm |date= |publisher=Web: Raboche-Krest'yanskaya Krasnaya Armiya |accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Suomen KAn taistelijoita.jpg|right|size|250px|Finnish People's Army soldiers]]
On 30 November, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totaling some 450,000 men, and [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II#Winter War|bombed Helsinki]].<ref name="K&Raunio" />{{rp|13}}<ref name="Jow&Snod2006" />{{rp|6}} Later the Finnish statesman J.K. Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a [[declaration of war]] violated three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu signed in 1920, the non-aggression pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed in 1932 and again in 1934, and also the Charter of the League of Nations, which the Soviet Union signed in 1934.<ref name="Turtola1999a" />{{rp|44–45}} C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] after the Soviet attack. In further reshuffling, the Finnish government named [[Risto Ryti]] as the new prime minister and [[Väinö Tanner]] as foreign minister.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|48-51}}

On 1 December, the Soviet Union formed a [[puppet government]] intended to rule Finland once the  Red Army would conquer it. Called the [[Finnish Democratic Republic]], it was headed by [[Otto Wille Kuusinen|O.W. Kuusinen]]. The government was also called "The Terijoki Government", named after the village of [[Terijoki]], the first place captured by the advancing Soviet army.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|58}} After the war the puppet government was disbanded. From the very outset of the war, [[working-class]] Finns stood behind the legal government in Helsinki.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|61}} Finnish national unity against the Soviet invasion was later called the [[spirit of the Winter War]].<ref name="Soikk1999">[[#Soikk1999|Soikkanen (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|235}}

At the start of the Winter War, Finland brought up the matter of the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations. The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|61}}

The Red Army invaded dozens of kilometers deep Finland during the first month of the war.|Major Soviet offensives from 30 November – 22 December 1939]]
At the beginning of the war, total victory over Finland was expected within a few weeks. The Red Army had just finished the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|invasion of eastern Poland]] at a cost of less than a thousand casualties. Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by the politician [[Andrei Zhdanov]] and military strategist [[Kliment Voroshilov]], but other generals had their doubts. The [[chief of staff]] of the Red Army, [[Boris Shaposhnikov]], advocated a serious buildup, extensive logistical and [[fire support]] preparations, and a rational [[order of battle]], deploying the army's best units. Zhdanov's military commander [[Kirill Meretskov]] reported at the start of the hostilities: "The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult." However, these doubts were not reflected in his troop deployments. Meretskov announced publicly that the Finnish campaign would take at the most two weeks. Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border into Sweden by mistake.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|34}}

Stalin's purges devastated the officer corps of the Red Army; those purged included three of its five marshals, 220 of its 264 division-level commanders or higher, and 36,761 officers of all ranks. Fewer than half of the officers remained in total.<ref name="RConquest">[[#Conquest2007|Conquest (2007)]]. p. 450.</ref> They were commonly replaced by soldiers who were less competent but more loyal to their superiors. Furthermore, unit commanders were superseded by a [[political commissar]], who ratified military decisions on their political merits, further complicating the Soviet chain of command.<ref name="Ries1988" />{{rp|56}} This system of dual command destroyed the independence of commanding officers.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|189}}

Soviet generals were impressed by the success of the German [[blitzkrieg]] [[Military tactics|tactics]]. However, the blitzkrieg had been tailored to central European conditions with a dense, well-mapped network of paved roads. Armies fighting in central Europe had recognised supply and communications centres, which could be easily targeted by armored vehicle regiments. Finnish army centres, by contrast, were deep inside the country. There were no paved roads, and even gravel or dirt roads were scarce; most of the terrain consisted of trackless forests and swamps. Waging a blitzkrieg in Finland was a highly difficult proposition, and the Red Army failed to meet the level of tactical coordination and local initiative required to execute blitzkrieg tactics in the Finnish theatre.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|35-36}}

The Soviet forces were positioned as follows:<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|38-39}}
*The [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|Seventh Army]], comprising nine divisions, a tank corps and three tank brigades,<ref name="K&Raunio"/>{{rp|13}} was located on the [[Karelian Isthmus]].  Its objective was the city of [[Vyborg|Viipuri]]. The force was later divided into the Seventh and [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|Thirteenth armies]].
*The [[8th Army (Soviet Union)|Eighth Army]], comprising six divisions and a tank brigade<ref name="K&Raunio" />{{rp|13}}, was located north of [[Lake Ladoga]].  Its mission was to execute a flanking manoeuvre around the northern shore of [[Lake Ladoga]] to strike at the rear of the [[Mannerheim Line]].
*The [[9th Army (Soviet Union)|Ninth Army]] was positioned to strike into central Finland. It was composed of three divisions with one additional division on its way.<ref name="K&Raunio" />{{rp|13}} Its mission was to thrust westward to cut Finland in half.
*The [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|Fourteenth Army]], comprising three divisions,<ref name="K&Raunio" />{{rp|13}}, was based in [[Murmansk]].  Its objective was to capture the Arctic port of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] and then advance to the town of [[Rovaniemi]].

{{See also|Finnish Army (1939)}}
The Finnish strategy was dictated by geography. The frontier with the Soviet Union was more than {{convert|1000|km|mi}} long but was mostly impassable except along a handful of [[unpaved road]]s. In prewar calculations, the Finnish General Staff, which had established its wartime headquarters at [[Mikkeli]],<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|38-39}} estimated seven Soviet divisions on the Isthmus and no more than five along the whole border north of Lake Ladoga. In that case, the manpower ratio would favour the attacker by a ratio of 3:1. The true ratio was much higher; for example, twelve Soviet divisions were deployed to the north of Lake Ladoga.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|42-44}}

An even greater problem than lack of soldiers was the lack of [[materiel]]; foreign shipments of antitank weapons and aircraft were arriving in small quantities. The ammunition situation was alarming, as stockpiles had cartridges, shells and fuel only for 19–60 days. The ammunition shortage meant the Finns could seldom afford [[Counter-battery fire|counterbattery]] or [[saturation fire]]. Finnish tank forces were operationally non-existent.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|42-44}}

The Finnish forces were positioned as follows:<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|47}}
*The [[Army of the Isthmus]] was composed of six divisions under the command of [[Hugo Viktor Österman|Hugo Österman]]. The [[Finnish II Corps (Winter War)|II. Army Corps]] was positioned on its right flank and the [[Finnish III Corps (Winter War)|III. Army Corps]] was positioned on its left flank.
*The [[Finnish IV Corps (Winter War)|IV. Army Corps]] was located north of Lake Ladoga. It was composed of two divisions under [[Juho Heiskanen]], who was soon replaced by [[Woldemar Hägglund]].
*The [[North Finland Group]] was a collection of [[White Guard (Finland)|Civic Guard]]s, [[border guard]]s, and drafted [[reservist]] units under [[Wiljo Tuompo]].

The Finnish main defensive line, which became known as the [[Mannerheim Line]], was located on the Karelian Isthmus about {{convert|30|to|75|km|mi|0}} from the old Soviet/Finnish border. Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000 facing 130,000 Finns.<ref name="UittoGeust8">[[#GeustUitto2006|Geust; Uitto (2006)]]. p. 54.</ref> The Finnish command deployed a covering force of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line in order to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|69}}

In combat, the biggest cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers were Soviet [[tank]]s. The Finns had few [[anti-tank weapon]]s and insufficient training in modern [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank tactics]]. However, the favoured Soviet armored tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited. The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the [[Bogie#Tracked vehicles|bogie wheels]] would often immobilise a tank. Soon, Finns fielded a better ''[[ad hoc]]'' weapon, the [[Molotov Cocktail]]. It was a glass bottle filled with [[Flammability|flammable]] [[liquid]]s, with a simple hand-lit [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish ''[[Alko]]'' corporation and bundled with matches with which to light them. Eighty Soviet tanks were destroyed in the border-zone fighting.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|72-73}}

By 6 December, all the Finnish covering forces had withdrawn to the Mannerheim Line. The Red Army began its first major attack against the Line in [[Taipale]] – the area between the shore of Lake Ladoga, the [[Burnaya River|Taipale river]] and the [[Suvanto]] waterway. Along the Suvanto sector, the Finns had a slight advantage of elevation and dry ground to dig into. The Finnish [[artillery]] had scouted the area and made fire plans in advance, anticipating a Soviet assault. The [[Battle of Taipale]] began with a forty-hour Soviet artillery preparation. After the [[Barrage (artillery)|barrage]], the Soviet infantry attacked across open ground but was repulsed with heavy casualties. From 6–12 December the Red Army continued trying to engage using only one division. The Red Army next strengthened its artillery and brought tanks and the 10th [[List of infantry divisions of the Soviet Union 1917–1957|Rifle Division]] to the Taipale front. On 14 December, the bolstered Soviet forces launched a new attack but were pushed back again. A third Soviet division entered the fight but performed poorly and panicked under shell fire. The assaults continued without success, and the Red Army suffered heavy losses. One typical Soviet attack during the battle lasted just an hour but left 1,000 dead and twenty-seven tanks strewn on the ice.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|76-78}}

North of Lake Ladoga, on the [[Ladoga Karelia]] front, the defending Finnish units relied on the terrain. Ladoga Karelia, as a large forest wilderness, did not have road networks for the modern Red Army.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|51-55}} However, the Soviet 8th Army had extended a new railroad line to the border, which could double the supply capability on the front. But on 12 December, the advancing Soviet [[139th Rifle Division]], supported by the 56th Rifle Division, was defeated by a much smaller Finnish force under [[Paavo Talvela]] in the [[Battle of Tolvajärvi|Tolvajärvi]], the first Finnish victory of the war.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|121}}

In central and northern Finland, roads were few and the terrain hostile. The Finns did not expect large-scale Soviet attacks, but the Soviets sent eight divisions, heavily supported by armor and artillery. The 155th Rifle Division attacked at [[Lieksa]], and further north the 44th attacked at [[Kuhmo]]. The 163rd Rifle Division was deployed at [[Suomussalmi]] and charged with cutting Finland in half by marching the [[Raate Road]]. In [[Finnish Lapland]], the Soviet 88th and 122nd Rifle Divisions attacked at [[Salla]]. The arctic port of Petsamo was attacked by the 104th Mountain Rifle Division by sea and land, supported by [[Naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]].<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|53-54}}

[[File:Russo-FinnishWar.PNG|thumb|right|alt=Three diagrams present major assaults by the Red Army.|Major Soviet operations during the winter of 1939–1940]]
The winter of 1939–1940 was exceptionally cold. One location on the Karelian Isthmus experienced a record low temperature of {{convert|-43|°C|°F|0}} on 16 January 1940.<ref name="Paula1999">[[#Paula1999|Paulaharju (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|292}} At the beginning of the war, only those Finnish soldiers who were in active [[military service|service]] had [[uniforms]] and [[weapons]]. The rest had to make do with their own clothing, which for many soldiers was their normal winter clothing with semblance of an insignia added. Finnish soldiers were skilled in [[cross-country skiing]].<ref name="Paula1999" />{{rp|289–290}}

The cold, the snow, the forest, and the long hours of darkness were factors that the Finns could turn to their advantage. The Finns dressed in layers, and the [[Ski warfare|ski troopers]] wore a lightweight white snow cape. This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible as the Finns executed [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attacks]] against Soviet columns. At the beginning of the war, Soviet tanks were painted in standard [[olive drab]] and men dressed in regular [[khaki]] uniforms. Not until late January 1940 did the Soviets paint their equipment white and issue [[snowsuit]]s to their infantry.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|145-146}}

Most Soviet soldiers had proper winter clothes, but this was not the case with every unit. In the [[battle of Suomussalmi]], many Soviet soldiers died of [[frostbite]]. The Soviet troops lacked skill in skiing, so soldiers were restricted to movement by road and were forced to move in long columns. Furthermore, the Red Army lacked proper winter tents, and men had to sleep in improvised shelters.<ref name="Paula1999" />{{rp|297–298}} Some Soviet units had frostbite casualties as high as 10% even before crossing the Finnish border.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|145-146}} The cold weather did confer one advantage: Soviet tanks were able to move more easily over frozen terrain and bodies of water, rather than being immobilised in swamps and mud.<ref name="Paula1999" />{{rp|297-298}}

In battles from Ladoga Karelia all the way north to the Arctic port of Petsamo, the Finns used guerrilla tactics. The Red Army was superior in numbers and materiel, but the Finns used the advantages of speed, tactics, and [[economy of force]]. Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the [[battle of Raate road]], the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces. With Soviet forces divided into smaller pieces, the Finns could deal with them individually and attack from all sides.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|131-132}}

For many of the encircled Soviet troops in a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|pocket]], (''[[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Motti|motti]]'' in Finnish), just staying alive was an ordeal comparable to combat. The men were freezing and starving and endured poor sanitary conditions. Historian [[William R. Trotter]] describes these conditions thus: "The Soviet soldier had no choice. If he refused to fight, he would be shot. If he tried to sneak through the forest, he would freeze to death. And surrender was no option for him; Soviet propaganda had told him how the Finns would torture prisoners to death."<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|148-149}}

Defence of the Mannerheim Line

<text>

The terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow the exercise of guerilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to more conventional means: a fortified defence line, the [[Mannerheim Line]], with its flanks protected by large bodies of water. Soviet [[propaganda]] claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the [[Maginot Line]]. Finnish [[historian]]s, for their part, have belittled the line's strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]].<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|62-63}}

The Finns had built 221 strongpoints along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s. Many were extended in the late 1930s. Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one [[reinforced concrete]] bunker per kilometer. Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe.<ref name="Vuore1999">[[#Vuore1999|Vuorenmaa (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|494-495}} According to the Finns, the real strength of the line was "stubborn defenders with a lot of ''[[sisu]]''" – a Finnish idiom roughly translated as "[[Courage|guts]]."<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|62-63}}

On the eastern side of the isthmus, the Red Army attempted to break through the Mannerheim line in the [[battle of Taipale]]. On the western side, Soviet units faced the Finnish line at [[Summa]], near the city of Viipuri, on 16 December. The Finns had built 41 reinforced concrete bunkers in the Summa area, making the defensive line in this area stronger than anywhere else on the Karelian Isthmus. However, because of a mistake in planning, the nearby Munasuo swamp had a kilometre-wide gap in the line.<ref name="Laaks1999">[[#Laaksonen1999|Laaksonen (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|407}} During the first [[battle of Summa]], a number of Soviet tanks broke through the thin line on 19 December, but the Soviets could not benefit from the situation because of insufficient cooperation between branches of service. The Finns remained in their trenches, allowing the Soviet tanks to move freely behind the Finnish line, as the Finns had no proper anti-tank weapons. However, the Finns succeeded in repelling the main Soviet assault. The tanks, stranded behind enemy lines, attacked the strongpoints at random until they were eventually destroyed, 20 in all. By 22 December, the battle ended in a Finnish victory.<ref name="Laaks1999" />{{rp|411–412}}

The Soviet advance was stopped at the Mannerheim Line. Red Army troops suffered from poor morale and a shortage of supplies, eventually refusing to participate in more [[Human wave attack|suicidal frontal attacks]]. The Finns, led by General [[Harald Öhquist]], decided to launch a counterattack and encircle three Soviet divisions into a ''motti'' near Viipuri on 23 December. Öhquist's plan was bold, but it failed. The Finns lost 1,300 men, and the Soviets were later estimated to have lost a similar number.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|87-89}}

The gun stands camouflaged in the city of Viipuri in March 1940.]]
The strength of the Red Army north of Lake Ladoga (in Ladoga Karelia) surprised the Finnish General Staff. Two Finnish divisions were deployed there: the 12th Division led by [[Lauri Tiainen]] and the 13th Division led by [[Hannu Hannuksela]]. They also had a support group of three [[brigade]]s, bringing their total strength to over 30,000. The Soviets deployed a [[Division (military)|division]] for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border. The Eighth Army was led by [[Ivan Nikitich Khabarov|Ivan Khabarov]], who was replaced by [[Grigori Shtern]] on 13 December.<ref name="K&Raunio"/>{{rp|113}} The Soviets' mission was to destroy the Finnish troops in the area of Ladoga Karelia and advance into the area between [[Sortavala]] and [[Joensuu]] within 10 days. The Soviets had a three-to-one advantage in manpower and five-to-one advantage in artillery as well as [[air supremacy]].<ref name="Juuti1999a">[[#Juuti1999a|Juutilainen (1999a)]]</ref>{{rp|504-505}}

Finnish forces panicked and retreated in front of the overwhelming Red Army. The commander of the Finnish IV Army Corps was replaced by [[Woldemar Hägglund]] on 4 December.<ref name="Juuti1999a" />{{rp|506}} On 7 December, in the middle of the Ladoga Karelian front, Finnish units retreated near the small stream of [[Kollaa River|Kollaa]]. The waterway itself did not offer protection, but alongside there were [[ridge]]s up to {{convert|10|m|ft}} high. The [[battle of Kollaa]] lasted until the end of the war. A memorable quote, "Kollaa holds" ({{lang-fi|Kollaa kestää}}) became a legendary motto among the Finns.<ref name="Juuti1999a" />{{rp|520}} Further contributing to the legend of Kollaa was the sniper [[Simo Häyhä]], dubbed "the White Death" by Soviets, who served in the Kollaa front. To the north, the Finns retreated from [[Ägläjärvi]] to [[Tolvajärvi]] on 5 December and then repelled a Soviet offensive in the [[battle of Tolvajärvi]] on 11 December.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|110}}

In the south, two Soviet divisions were united on the northern side of the Lake Ladoga coastal road. As before, these divisions were trapped as the more mobile Finnish units were able to counterattack from the north to flank the Soviet columns. On 19 December, the Finns temporarily ceased their assaults, as the soldiers were exhausted.<ref name="Juuti1999a" />{{rp|510-511}} It was not until the period 6 January to 16 January 1940 that the Finns went on the offensive again, cutting Soviet division into smaller groups of different-sized ''mottis.''<ref name="Juuti1999a" />{{rp|514}}

Contrary to Finnish expectations, the encircled Soviet divisions did not try to break through to the east but instead entrenched. They were expecting reinforcements and supplies to [[airlift|arrive by air]]. As the Finns lacked the necessary heavy artillery equipment and were short of men, they often did not directly attack ''mottis'' they had created; instead, they focused on eliminating only the most dangerous threats. Often the ''motti'' tactic was not part of pre-planned doctrine but a Finnish adaptation to the behaviour of Soviet troops under fire.<ref name="Jow&Snod2006" />{{rp|44}}

In spite of the cold and hunger, the Soviet troops did not surrender easily but fought bravely, often entrenching their tanks to be used as [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]]es and building timber dugouts. Some specialist Finnish soldiers were called in to attack the ''mottis''; the most famous of them was Major [[Matti Aarnio]], or "Motti-Matti," as he became known.<ref name="Juuti1999a" />{{rp|516-517}}

In northern Karelia, Soviet forces were outmanoeuvred at [[Ilomantsi]] and [[Lieksa]]. The Finns used effective guerrilla tactics, taking special advantage of superior skiing skills and snow-white layered clothing and executing many surprise ambushes and raids. By the end of December, the Soviets decided to retreat and transfer resources to more critical fronts.<ref name="Vuore1999" />{{rp|559–561}}

Suomussalmi–Raate double operation

<text>

[[File:Raate road.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A road in the middle of forest and snow, a frozen body in front and destroyed vehicles in behind.|Soviet equipment and bodies of Red Army soldiers after the [[Battle of Raate road]] in January 1940]]
The Suomussalmi–Raate was a double operation,<ref name="Vuore1999" />{{rp|550}} which would later be used by [[Military academy|military academics]] as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary. [[Suomussalmi]] was a small provincial town of 4,000. The area has long lakes, many wild forests and few roads. The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack here, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of [[Oulu]] and effectively cut Finland in two. There were two roads leading to Suomussalmi from the frontier: the northern Juntusranta road and the southern Raate road.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|150}}

The battle of Raate road, which occurred during the month-long [[battle of Suomussalmi]], resulted in one of the largest losses in the Winter War. The Soviet 44th and parts of the 163rd Rifle Divisions, comprising about 14,000 troops,<ref name="Kulju2007">[[#Kulju2007|Kulju (2007)]]</ref>{{rp|230}} were almost completely destroyed by a Finnish ambush as they marched along the forest road. A small unit blocked the Soviet advance while Finnish Colonel [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]] and his 9th Division cut off the retreat route, split the enemy force into smaller fragments, and then proceeded to destroy the remnants as they retreated. The Soviets suffered 7,000–9,000 casualties,<ref name="Kulju2007" />{{rp|229}} while the Finnish units lost only 400 men.<ref name="Kanta1998">[[#Kanta1998|Kantakoski (1998)]]</ref>{{rp|283}} In addition, the Finnish troops captured dozens of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, hundreds of trucks, almost 2,000 horses, thousands of rifles, and much-needed ammunition and medical supplies.<ref name="Kulju2007" />{{rp|217–218}}

In Finnish [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] the forests gradually thin out until in the north there are no trees at all. Thus, the area offers more room for tank deployment, but it is vastly underpopulated and experiences copious snowfall. The Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols, but instead the Soviets sent full divisions.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|171-174}} On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the [[Lapland Group]] from the [[North Finland Group]]. The group was placed under the command of [[Kurt Martti Wallenius|Kurt Wallenius]].<ref name="Lesk&Juuti1999">[[#Lesk&Juuti1999|Leskinen and Juutilainen (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|164}}

In southern Lapland, near the tiny rural village of [[Salla]], the Soviet force advanced with two divisions, the 88th and 112th, totalling 35,000 men. In the [[Battle of Salla (1939)|battle of Salla]] the Soviets advanced easily to Salla, where the road forked. The northern branch moved toward [[Pelkosenniemi]] while the rest pushed on toward [[Kemijärvi]]. On 17 December, the Soviet northern group, comprising an infantry regiment, a battalion, and a company of tanks, was outflanked by a Finnish [[battalion]]. The 112th retreated, leaving much of its heavy equipment and vehicles behind. Following this success, the Finns shuttled reinforcements down to the defensive line in front of Kemijärvi. The Soviets hammered the defensive line without success.

To the north was Finland's only ice-free port in the Arctic, Petsamo. The Finns did not have the manpower to defend it fully as the main front was down the Karelian Isthmus. In the [[Battle of Petsamo (1939)|battle of Petsamo]], the Soviet 104th division attacked the Finnish 104th Independent Cover Company. The Finns gave up Petsamo easily and concentrated on delaying actions. The area was treeless, windy and relatively low, offering little defensible terrain. However, during the winter, the Finns in Lapland had the advantage of [[polar night|almost constant darkness]] and extreme temperatures. The Finns executed guerrilla attacks against Soviet supply lines and patrols. As a result, the Soviet movements were halted by the efforts of one-fifth as many Finns.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|171-174}}

Joseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of the first month of the Finnish campaign. The Red Army had been humiliated. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was working hard to explain the failures of the Soviet army to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the [[Maginot Line]], and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland. Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov was given full authority over operations in the Finnish theatre, and he ordered the suspension of frontal assaults in late December. Kliment Voroshilov was replaced with [[Semyon Timoshenko]] as the commander of the Soviet forces in the war on 7 January.<ref name="Trotter15">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 203–204.</ref>

The main focus of the Soviet attack was switched to the Karelian Isthmus. Timoshenko and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]] reorganised and tightened control between different branches of service in the Red Army. They also changed tactical doctrines to meet the realities of the situation. All Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus were divided into two armies: the [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|7th]] and the [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Armies]]. The 7th Army, now under Kirill Meretskov, would concentrate three-fourths of its strength against the {{convert|16|km|mi|0|adj=on}} stretch of the Mannerheim Line between [[Taipale]] and the Munasuo swamp. Tactics would be basic: an armored wedge for the initial breakthrough, followed by the main infantry and vehicle assault force. The Red Army would prepare by pinpointing the Finnish frontline fortifications. The 123rd Assault Division then rehearsed the assault on life-size [[mockup]]s. The Soviets shipped massive numbers of new tanks and artillery pieces to the theatre. Troops were increased from ten divisions to 25–26 divisions, 6–7 tank brigades and several independent tank platoons, totalling 600,000 men.<ref name="Laaks1999" />{{rp|424–425}} On 1 February 1940, the Red Army began a massive offensive, firing 300,000 shells into the Finnish line in the first 24&nbsp;hours of the [[bombardment]].<ref name="Trotter16" />

Although the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets began increasing bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications. During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night. The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 men in [[trench warfare]]. The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults with one or two companies.<ref name="Laaks1999" />{{rp|426–427}} Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks. On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air bombardments.<ref name="Trotter16">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 214–215.</ref>

Although the Soviets refined their tactics and morale improved, the generals were still willing to accept massive losses in order to reach their objectives. Attacks were screened by smoke, heavy artillery and armor support, but the infantry charged in the open and in dense formations.<ref name="Trotter16" /> Unlike their tactics in December, Soviet tanks advanced in smaller numbers. The Finns could not easily eliminate tanks if infantry troops protected them.<ref name="Laaks1999" />{{rp|430}} After 10 days of round-the-clock artillery barrages, the Soviets achieved a breakthrough on the western Karelian Isthmus in the second [[battle of Summa]].<ref name="Trotter16a">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. p. 218.</ref>

On 11 February, the Soviets had about 460,000 men, over 3,350 artillery pieces, about 3,000 tanks and about 1,300 aircraft deployed on the Karelian Isthmus. The Red Army was constantly receiving new recruits after the breakthrough.<ref name="UittoGeust9">[[#GeustUitto2006|Geust; Uitto (2006)]]. p. 77.</ref> Opposing them the Finns had eight divisions, totalling about 150,000 men.

Peace negotiations
</heading>
<text>


Although the Finns attempted to re-open negotiations with Moscow by every means during the war, the Soviets did not respond. In early January, Finnish communist and feminist playwright [[Hella Wuolijoki]] contacted the Finnish government. She offered to contact Moscow through the Soviet Union's ambassador to Sweden, [[Alexandra Kollontai]]. Wuolijoki departed for [[Stockholm]] and met Kollontai secretly at a hotel. Soon Molotov decided to extend recognition to the [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]]–[[Väinö Tanner|Tanner]] government as the legal government of Finland and put an end to the puppet [[Terijoki Government]] of [[Otto Wille Kuusinen|Kuusinen]] that the Soviets had set up.<ref name="Trotter17">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 234–235.</ref>

By mid-February, it became clear that the Finnish forces were rapidly approaching exhaustion. For the Soviets, casualties were high, the situation was a source of political embarrassment of the Soviet regime, and there was a risk of [[Franco-British plans for intervention in the Winter War|Franco-British intervention]]. Furthermore, with the spring thaw approaching, the Soviet forces risked becoming bogged down in the forests. The Finnish foreign minister Väinö Tanner arrived in Stockholm on 12 February and negotiated the peace terms with the Soviets through the Swedes. German representatives, not aware that the negotiations were underway, suggested on 17 February that Finland negotiate with the Soviet Union.<ref name="Trotter18">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 246–247.</ref>

Both Germany and Sweden were keen to see an end to the Winter War. The Germans feared losing iron ore fields in northern Sweden and threatened to attack at once if the Swedes granted the Allied forces right of passage. The Germans even had a theoretical invasion plan called the ''Studie Nord'' against Scandinavian countries, which later became the full-blown [[Operation Weserübung]].<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|261}} As the Finnish Cabinet hesitated in the face of the harsh Soviet conditions, Sweden's King [[Gustav V of Sweden|Gustav V]] made a [[statsrådsdiktamen by Gustaf V|public statement]] on 19 February in which he confirmed having declined Finnish pleas for support from Swedish troops. On 25 February, the Soviet peace terms were spelled out in detail. On 29 February, the Finnish government accepted the Soviet terms in principle and was willing to enter into negotiations.<ref name="Trotter18a">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 247–248.</ref>

On 5 March, the Red Army advanced {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|0}} past the Mannerheim Line and entered the suburbs of Viipuri. That same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the western [[Gulf of Viipuri]]. The Finns proposed an [[armistice]] on that day, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer the next day. The Finnish peace delegation went to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March. The Soviets made further demands as their military position was strong and improving. On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire as troops were experiencing heavy casualties. In addition, artillery ammunition supplies were exhausted and weapons were wearing out. The Finnish government, noting that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the right of Allied passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms.<ref name="Trotter18b">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 249–251.</ref> The formal peace treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March.

<text>

The Soviet Union enjoyed [[air supremacy]] throughout the war. The [[Soviet Air Force]], supporting the Red Army's invasion with about 2,500 aircraft (the most common of which was the [[Tupolev SB]]) was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped. The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland did not offer many valuable targets for [[strategic bombing]]. Very often, targets were small village depots with little value. The country had only a few modern [[highway]]s in the interior, therefore making [[railway]] systems the main targets for bombers. The [[rail track]]s were cut thousands of times, but they were easy to repair and Finns usually had [[train]]s running again in a matter of hours.<ref name="Trotter12">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. p. 187.</ref> The Soviet air force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February they instituted more effective tactics.<ref name="Trotter21b">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]] p. 193.</ref>

The largest bombing raid against the capital of Finland, [[Helsinki]], occurred on the [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II#Winter War|first day of the war]]. The capital was bombed only a few times thereafter. All in all, Finland lost only 5% of total man-hour production time because of Soviet bombings. Nevertheless, Soviet air attacks affected thousands of civilians, killing 957,<ref name="Kur&Lent2005">[[#Kur&Lent2005|Kurenmaa and Lentilä (2005)]]</ref>{{rp|1152}} as the Soviets recorded 2,075 bombing attacks in 516 localities. The city of Viipuri, a major Soviet objective close to the Karelian Isthmus front, was almost levelled by nearly 12,000 bombs.<ref name="Trotter12b">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 187–188.</ref> No attacks on civilian targets were mentioned in Soviet radio or newspaper reports.

At the beginning of the war, Finland had a very small air force, with only 114 combat planes fit for duty. Missions were very limited, and [[fighter aircraft]] were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers. Strategic bombings could also double as opportunities for military [[reconnaissance]]. Old-fashioned and few in number, aircraft could not offer support for Finnish ground troops. In spite of losses, the number of planes in the [[Finnish Air Force]] had risen by over 50 percent by the end of the war.<ref name="Peltonen">[[#Peltonen|Peltonen (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|607-608}} The Finns received shipments of British, French, Italian, Swedish and American aircraft.<ref name="Trotter21a">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. p. 189.</ref>

Finnish fighter pilots would often fly their motley collection of planes into Soviet formations that outnumbered them 10 or even 20 times. Finnish fighters shot down a confirmed 200 Soviet aircraft, losing 62 of their own.<ref name="Tillo1993" />{{rp|160}} In addition, Finnish anti-aircraft brought down more than 300 enemy aircraft.<ref name="Tillo1993" />{{rp|160}} Many times a Finnish forward [[air base]] consisted of a frozen lake, a [[windsock]], a [[telephone]] set and some tents.

Navies in frost

<text>

Naval activity during the Winter War was low. The [[Baltic Sea]] began to freeze over by the end of December, which made the movement of [[warship]]s very difficult; by mid-winter only [[ice-breaker]]s and [[submarine]]s could still move. The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of [[Soviet Navy]] forces in the area. The [[Baltic Fleet]] was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or [[landing craft]] to undertake large-scale operations. The Baltic Fleet possessed two [[battleship]]s, one [[heavy cruiser]], almost twenty [[destroyer]]s, 50 [[motor torpedo boat]]s, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels. The Soviets used naval bases in [[Paldiski]], [[Tallinn]] and [[Liepāja]] for their operations.<ref name="Elfv1999">[[#Elfv1999|Elfvegren (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|681}}

The [[Finnish Navy]] was a coastal defence force with two [[coastal defence ship]]s, five submarines, four [[gunboat]]s, seven motor torpedo boats, one [[minelayer]] and six [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]]. The two coastal defence ships, ''[[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Ilmarinen]]'' and ''[[Finnish coastal defence ship Väinämöinen|Väinämöinen]]'', were moved to the harbour in [[Turku]] where they were used to bolster the air defences. Their anti-aircraft guns shot down one or two planes over the city, and the ships remained there for the rest of the war.<ref name="Trotter" />{{rp|48-51}} In addition to its role in coastal defense, the Finnish Navy protected the Åland islands and Finnish [[merchant vessel]]s in the Baltic Sea.<ref name="Elfv1999" />{{rp|678}}

Soviet aircraft bombed Finnish vessels and harbours and dropped [[Naval mine|mines]] into Finnish [[seaway]]s. Still, Finnish losses were relatively low, numbering 26 merchant vessels, only four of which were lost inside Finnish [[territorial waters]].<ref name="Elfv1999" />{{rp|692}}

In addition to its navy, Finland had coastal artillery batteries to defend important harbours and naval bases along its coast. Most batteries were left over from the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Russian period]], with {{convert|152|mm|in|0}} guns being the most numerous. However, Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a {{convert|305|mm|in|0}} gun battery originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the [[Finnish–Estonian defense cooperation|help of batteries on the Estonian side]].<ref name="Lesk1999">[[#Lesk1999|Leskinen (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|130}}

The first naval battle took place on 1 December, near the island of [[Russarö]], {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} south of [[Hanko]]. That day, the weather was fair and the visibility excellent. The Finns spotted the Soviet [[Soviet cruiser Kirov|cruiser ''Kirov'']] and two destroyers. After the ships were at a range of {{convert|24|km|mi}}, the Finns opened fire with {{convert|234|mm|in|0}} coastal guns. After five minutes of firing by four coastal guns, the cruiser had been damaged by near misses and retreated. The destroyers remained undamaged, but the ''Kirov'' suffered 17 dead and 30 wounded. The Soviets already knew the locations of the Finnish coastal batteries but were surprised by their firing range.<ref name="Silvast">[[#Silvast|Silvast (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|694-696}}

The coastal artillery had a greater effect upon the land war by helping to reinforce the defence in conjunction with army artillery. Two sets of fortress artillery made significant contributions to the early battles on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ladoga Karelia. These were located at [[Kaarnajoki]] on the eastern isthmus and at [[Mantsi]] on the northeastern shore of Lake Ladoga. Furthermore, the fortress of [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]] provided similar support from the southwestern coast of the isthmus. Coastal artilleries had the ability to fire high-explosive shells of {{convert|152|mm|in|0}} calibre to a range of {{convert|25|km|mi}}.<ref name="Tillo1993" />{{rp|152–153}}

[[File:Norwegian Winter War Volunteers.jpg|thumb|alt=Three men soldiers with snowsuits and skies.|Norwegian volunteers in Northern Finland]]
World opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified. The World War had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States, the Winter War was the only real fighting in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest. Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military [[materiel]] to Finland. Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through Sweden to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this fact public, [[Adolf Hitler]] initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German–Soviet relations following the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name="Trotter18">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 194–202.</ref>

Volunteers arrived from various countries. By far the largest foreign contingent came from neighbouring Sweden, which provided nearly 8,760 volunteers during the war. The Swedish Volunteer Corps (''[[Svenska Frivilligkåren]]''), formed from the Swedes, the Norwegians (727 men) and the Danes (1,010 men), fought on the quiet northern front during the last weeks of the war. The Corps mainly took care of the air defence of northern Finland.<ref name="Jow&Snod2006" />{{rp|21–22}} Volunteers arrived from [[Estonia]], Italy and [[Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War|Hungary]].

France had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War. The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany's major ally if the Finns were to attack the Soviet Union. France had other motives as well, because it preferred to have a major war in a remote part of Europe over one on French soil. France planned to re-arm the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish exile units]] and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo. Another scheme was to execute a massive air strike with [[Turkey|Turkish]] co-operation against the [[Caucasus]] [[oil field]]s.<ref name="Trotter19" />

The British, for their part, wanted to block the flow of [[iron ore]] from Swedish mines to Germany because the Swedes supplied up to 40% of Germany's need.<ref name="Trotter19">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 235–236.</ref> The matter was raised by the British Admiral [[Reginald Plunkett]] on 18 September 1939, and the next day [[Winston Churchill]] brought the subject in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|141}} On 11 December Churchill opined that the British should gain a foothold in Scandinavia with the objective of helping the Finns but without a war on the Soviet Union.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|145}} Because of the heavy German reliance on Swedish iron, Hitler had made it clear to the Swedish government in December that any Allied troops on Swedish soil would immediately provoke a German invasion.<ref name="Trotter19a">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. p. 237.</ref>

On 19 December French Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]] introduced his plan to the General Staff and the British [[War Cabinet]]. In his plan, Daladier created linkage between the war in Finland and the iron ore in Sweden.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|145}} There was a danger of Finland's collapse under Soviet hegemony. In turn, Nazi Germany could occupy both Norway and Sweden. These two dictatorships could divide Scandinavia between them, as they had already done with Poland. The main motivation of France was to export the European battle front to Scandinavia in order to protect French soil, whereas the British were concerned with reducing the German war-making ability.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|146}}

The Military Coordination Committee met the next day in London, and two days later the French plan was put forward.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|146}} The [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council|Supreme War Council]] elected to send notes to Norway and Sweden on 27 December in which they urged the Norwegians and Swedes to help Finland and offer the [[Western Allies|Allies]] their support. Norway and Sweden rejected the offer on 5 January 1940.<ref name="Trotter19a" /> The Allies then came up with a new plan, in which they would demand that Norway and Sweden give them [[right of passage]] by citing the League of Nations resolution as justification. The expedition troops would disembark at the Norwegian port of [[Narvik]] and proceed by rail toward Finland, passing through the Swedish ore fields on the way. This demand was sent to Norway and Sweden on 6 January, but it too was rejected six days later.<ref name="Trotter19b">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 237–238.</ref>

Stymied but not yet dissuaded from the possibility of action, the Allies formulated a new plan on 29 January. First, the Finns would make a formal request for assistance. Then the Allies would ask Norway and Sweden for permission to move the "volunteers" across their territory. Finally, in order to protect the supply line from German actions, the Allies would send additional units ashore at [[Namsos]], [[Bergen]], and [[Trondheim]]. The operation would require 100,000 British and 35,000 French soldiers with naval and air support. The supply convoys would sail on 12 March and the landings would begin on 20 March.<ref name="Trotter19c">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. pp. 238–239.</ref>

The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940 and went into effect the following day. Finland ceded a portion of Karelia – the entire Karelian Isthmus as well as a large swath of land north of Lake Ladoga. The area included Finland's second largest city of Viipuri, much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant parts still held by Finland's army&mdash;all in all, 11 percent of the territory and 30 percent of the economic assets of pre-war Finland.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|18}} Twelve percent of Finland's population, some 422,000 Karelians, [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|were evacuated and lost their homes]].<ref name="Engle&Paan1985" />{{rp|142–143}}<ref name="helsinginsanomat1" />

Finland also had to cede a part of the region of [[Salla]], the [[Kalastajansaarento peninsula]] in the [[Barents Sea]], and four islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]].

The 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland.

After the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish army on the Karelian Isthmus had been the subject of debate in Finland. Orders were already issued to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector. Estimates of how long the Red Army could have been held in these kinds of retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days<ref>[[#Laaksonen2005|Laaksonen (2005)]]. p. 365.</ref> to a few weeks<ref>[[#Paasikivi1958|Paasikivi (1958)]]. p. 177</ref> or to a couple of months at most.<ref>[[#Halsti1955|Halsti (1955)]]. p. 412.</ref>

During the period between the war and the [[perestroika]] in the late 1980s, [[Soviet historiography]] leaned solely on [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]'s speeches on the Winter War. In his radio speech of 29 November 1939, Molotov argued that the Soviet Union had tried to negotiate guarantees of security for [[Saint-Petersburg|Leningrad]] for two months. However, the Finns had taken a hostile stance to "please foreign imperialists". Finland had undertaken military provocation, and the Soviet Union could no longer hold to nonaggression pacts. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union did not want to occupy or annex Finland; the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.<ref name="Viha1999">[[#Vihavainen|Vihavainen (1999)]]</ref>{{rp|893-896}}

Another source later used widely in Soviet historiography was Molotov's speech in front of the [[Supreme Soviet]] on 29 March 1940, in which he blamed Western countries for starting the war and argued that they had used Finland as a proxy to fight the Soviet Union. The Western Allies had furthermore tried to take neutral Sweden and Norway along with them. Thus, the "masterminds" behind the war were the United Kingdom and France, but also Sweden, the United States, and Italy, who had issued massive amounts of materiel, money, and men to Finland. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union was merciful in peace terms, as the problem of Leningrad security had been solved.<ref name="Viha1999" />

The Supreme Military Soviet met in April 1940, reviewed the lessons of the Finnish campaign, and recommended reforms. The role of frontline political commissars was reduced and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced. Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. However, not all of these reforms had been completed when the Germans began [[Operation Barbarossa]] 15 months later.<ref name="Trotter20">[[#Trotter2002|Trotter (2002)]]. p. 264.</ref>

That same year, Finland and Sweden negotiated a military alliance, but the negotiations ended once it became clear that both Germany and the Soviet Union opposed such an alliance.<ref name="1999b">[[#Turtola1999b|Turtola (1999b)]]</ref>{{rp|863}}

Germany

The Winter War was a political success for the Germans. Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Allied Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless. However, the German policy of neutrality was not popular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered badly. After the Peace of Moscow, Germany did not hesitate to move to improve ties with Finland, and within two weeks Finno-German relations were at the top of the agenda.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|277-279}}

During the [[Interim Peace]], Finland established close ties with Germany in hopes of a chance to reclaim areas ceded to the Soviet Union. Three days after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the [[Continuation War]] began.<ref name="Jow&Snod2006" />{{rp|10–11}}

Western Allies
</heading>
<text>

The Winter War put in question the organisation and effectiveness of the Red Army as well as the Western Allies. The Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its total unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France. This failure led to the collapse of the [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier government]] in France.<ref name="Edwards" />{{rp|13-14}}
