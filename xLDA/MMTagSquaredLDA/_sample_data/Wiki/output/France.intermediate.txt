{{Main|Name of France}}
{{See also|List of country name etymologies}}

The name "France" comes from the [[Latin]] ''Francia'', which means "country of the Franks".<ref>[http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/DF_history.shtml History of France] on DiscoverFrance</ref> There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word ''frankon'' which translates as ''javelin'' or ''lance'' as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a [[francisca]].<ref>{{cite book |last2=Blair |first2=Claude |last1=Tarassuk |first1=Leonid |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UJbyPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Encyclopedia+of+Arms+and+Weapons&cd=1 |year=1982 |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms and Weapons: the most comprehensive reference work ever published on arms and armor from prehistoric times to the present with over 1,250 illustrations |page=186 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=067142257X}}</ref> Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], Frank means ''free'' as opposed to [[slave]].

However, it is also possible that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks because, as the conquering class, only the Franks had the status of freemen. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In German (and other Germanic languages, such as Scandinavian languages and Dutch), France is still called "[[Francia|Realm of the Franks]]" (''Frankreich'', ''Frankrike'', ''Frankrige''). In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of [[Charlemagne]], Modern France is called ''Frankreich'' in German, while the Frankish Realm is called ''Frankenreich''.

{{Main|Prehistory of France|Gaul|Roman Gaul}}
[[File:Lascaux2.jpg|thumb|left|One of the paintings of Lascaux which represents a horse (Dordogne, approximately 18.000 BC).]]
The oldest traces of human life, in what is now France, date from approximately 1,800,000 years ago. Men were then confronted by a hard and variable climate, marked by several glacial eras which modified their framework of life and led them to a [[nomadic]] life of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters-gatherers]]. France counts a large number of decorated caves from the [[upper Paleolithic]] era, including one of the most famous and best preserved: [[Lascaux]] ([[Dordogne]], approximately 18,000 BC).

At the end of the [[Last glacial period]] (10.000 BC), the climate softened and from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of [[Western Europe]] entered the [[Neolithic]] era and its inhabitants became [[sedentary]]. After a strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially with the work of gold, copper and bronze, and later with iron.

In 600 BC, [[Ionia]]n [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|Greeks]], originating from [[Phocaea]], founded the [[Colonies in antiquity|colony of Massalia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]), on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], making it the oldest city of France.<ref name="The Cambridge ancient history">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&pg=RA1-PA754 |title='&#39;The Cambridge ancient history'&#39; p.754 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="Orrieux">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&pg=PA62 |title='&#39;A history of ancient Greece'&#39; Claude Orrieux p.62 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated some parts of the current territory of France, but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC.

The concept of [[Gaul]] emerged at that time; it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the [[Rhine]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the Mediterranean Sea. The borders of modern France are approximately the same as those of ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by [[Celt]]ic ''Gauls''. Gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman influences. However, around 390 BC, the Gallic [[chieftain]] [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] made his own way through the [[Alps]], defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of the Allia]] and sacked [[Rome]] for several months. The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened and encouraged several subdued Italian tribes to rebel. One by one, over the course of the next 50 years, these tribes were defeated and brought back under Roman dominion. Meanwhile, the Gauls would continue to harass the region until 345 BC, when they entered into a formal treaty with Rome. But Romans and Gauls would maintain an adversarial relationship for the next several centuries and the Gauls would remain a threat in [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]].

[[File:Gaule -59.png|thumb|left|Gallic tribes before the Roman conquest]]

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans who called this region ''Provincia Romana'' ("Roman Province"), which evolved into the name [[Provence]] in French.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZEIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76&dq=Provincia+Romana+Roman+Province+Provence&hl=en&ei=XXYLTbWGL8a1hAfio-X0Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Provincia%20Romana%20Roman%20Province%20Provence&f=false |title=Life magazine, 13&nbsp;July 1953, p.76 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=13 July 1953 |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> The sacking of Rome was still remembered by Romans, when [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul, and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC.<ref>[[Plutarch]] claimed one million people (probably 1 in 4 of the [[Gauls]]) died, another million were enslaved, 300 tribes were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed during the [[Gallic Wars]].</ref>

[[File:271 Maison carr e NIM 1016.jpg|thumb|The [[Maison Carrée]] was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day [[Nîmes]]) and is one of the best preserved vestiges of the [[Roman Empire]]]]

Gaul was divided by [[Augustus]] into Roman provinces, the principal ones being [[Gallia Narbonensis]] in the south, [[Gallia Aquitania]] in the south-west, [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in the center and [[Gallia Belgica]] in the north. Many cities were founded during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]], including Lugdunum (present-day [[Lyon]]), which is considered to be the capital of the Gauls. These cities were built in the traditional Roman style, with a [[Roman Forum|forum]], a [[theatre]], a [[circus]], an [[amphitheatre]] and [[thermal baths]]. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted [[Romance languages|Roman]] speech ([[Latin]], from which the [[French language]] evolved) and Roman culture. The [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] merged with the [[Celtic polytheism|Gallic paganism]] into the same [[syncretism]].

Around the 3rd century AD, Roman Gaul underwent a serious crisis with its "[[limes]]" (fortified borders protecting the Empire) crossed on several occasions by [[Barbarian Invasions|Barbarians]]. The weakness of the central imperial power, at this time, led Gallo-Roman leaders to proclaim the independence of the short-lived [[Gallic Empire]], which ended with the [[Battle of Châlons (274)|Battle of Châlons]] in 274, which saw Gaul reincorporated in the Roman Empire.

Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century AD, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul. In 312, the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantin I]] converted to [[Christianity]]. Christians, persecuted until then, multiplied across the entire Roman Empire. But, from the second half of the 4th century AD, the Barbarian Invasions started again, and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], such as the [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] crossed the Rhine and settled in Gaul, [[Spain]] and other parts of the collapsing Roman Empire. At the end of the [[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]] period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and some remaining Gallo-Roman territories, notably the [[Kingdom of Syagrius]].

[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|Frankish expansion from the early [[Clovis I]]' kingdom (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870).]]

The pagan [[Franks]], from whom the ancient name of “Francie” was derived, originally settled the North-East of [[Gaul]], but conquered most of northern and central Gaul, under Clovis I. The Frankish King Clovis I was the first Germanic conquerors after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert, in 498, to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity, rather than [[Arianism]]; thus France obtained the title “Eldest daughter of the Church” (''La fille aînée de l’Église'') from the papacy,<ref>[http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html Faith of the Eldest Daughter - Can France retain her Catholic heritage?] - [http://www.wf-f.org/ Women for Faith and Family]</ref> and the French kings would adopt this as justification for calling their country “the Most Christian Kingdom of France”, until the [[French Revolution]]. The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman heritage, and ancient Gaul was progressively renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romanic languages]], except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where [[Germanic languages]] emerged. Clovis made [[Paris]] his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]] but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Rheims]]. The last [[Merovingian]] kings, sometimes referred as ''[[Rois fainéants]]'' ("lazy kings"), [[Power behind the throne|lost effective power]] to their [[mayors of the palace]].

[[File:Frontiere francaise 985 1947 small.gif|thumb|French territorial gains (green) and losses (red) from 985 to present-day ([[Overseas departments and territories of France|Overseas possessions]]  not shown, see below)]]

The mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated a [[Muslim]] invasion from [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdoms. His son [[Pepin the Short]] eventually seized the crown of Francia from the discredited Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pippin's son, [[Charlemagne]] reunited the Frankish Kingdoms and built a vast empire across [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]].

[[File:Jeanne d Arc Orleanide.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joan of Arc]] led the French army to several important victories during the [[Hundred Years' War]] which paved the way for the final victory.]]

Proclaimed "[[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]]" by the [[Pope]], Charlemagne tried to revive the [[Western Roman Empire]] and its cultural grandeur, from its [[Palace of Aachen]]. The efficient administration of this immense empire was ensured by high civil servants, carrying the, still non-hereditary, titles of [[count]]s (in charge of a [[County]]), [[marquis]] (in charge of a [[March (territory)|March]]), [[duke]]s (military commanders), etc. 

Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious|Louis I]] (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I's death. The Empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), into [[East Francia]] to [[Louis the German]], [[Middle Francia]] to [[Lothair I]] and [[West Francia]] to [[Charles the Bald]]. Western Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was the precursor to modern France.<ref>[http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/treaty-of-verdun.htm Treaty of Verdun] - Howstuffworks</ref> Constantly threatened by [[Viking invasions]], France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, the authority of the king became more religious than effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in France. Some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they would become a threat to the king. By example, after the [[Battle of Hastings]], in 1066, the [[William the Conqueror|Duke of Normandy]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal (as Duke of [[Normandy]]) and equal (as king of [[England]]) to the king of France.

The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]], Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned [[King of France]].<ref>[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1008&HistoryID=ab03&gtrack=pthc History of France : The Capetian kings of France: AD 987-1328] - History World</ref> His descendants, the [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]], the [[House of Valois]] and the [[House of Bourbon]], progressively unified the country through a series of wars, such as the [[Saintonge War]], and dynastic inheritance into a Kingdom of France. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical [[Cathars]] in the south-western area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous [[County of Toulouse]] was annexed.<ref>{{cite news | title = Massacre of the Pure | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897752-2,00.html | newspaper = Time | location = New York | date = 28 April 1961 }}</ref>
Later Kings expanded their territory to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the North, Centre and West of France. French [[knight]]s took also an active part in the various [[Crusades]] that were fought, between 1095 and 1291, to restore Christian control over the [[Holy Land]]. Meanwhile, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred around a [[Estates of the realm|hierarchically conceived society]] distinguishing [[French nobility|nobility]], [[clergy]], and [[Third Estate|commoner]]s.

The [[French Renaissance]] saw a long set of wars, known as the [[Italian Wars]], between the Kingdom of France and the powerful [[Holy Roman Empire]] It saw also the first standardization of the [[French language]], which will become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. French explorers, such as [[Jacques Cartier]] or [[Samuel de Champlain]], claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the [[French colonial empire#First French colonial empire|First French colonial empire]]. The rise of [[Protestantism]] in Europe led France to a civil war know as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of [[Huguenots]] were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day Massacre of Saint Bartholomew’s Day]. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]].</ref> The wars of Religion were ended in France by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s [[Edict of Nantes]] which granted some freedom of religion to the [[Huguenot]]s. Henry IV was eventually murdered by a [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic fanatic]].

The monarchy reached its height during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into [[courtier]]s in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. At this time, France possessed the largest population in Europe (see [[Demographics of France]]) and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. Since the 18th century, French was the most used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, until the emergence of the USA in the 20th century.<ref name="Language and Diplomacy">[http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/language-and-diplomacy/ Language and Diplomacy] - Naked Translations</ref> In addition, France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia.

Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]],  while the [[Metropolitan France|continental territory of France]] kept growing, with notable acquisitions such as [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] (1766) and [[Corsica]] (1770), most of its overseas possessions were lost after the French defeat during the [[Seven Years' War]], which ended in 1763.

[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] actively [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported the Americans]] seeking independence from [[Great Britain]] (realized in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]]). The example of the [[American Revolution]] was one of the many contributing factors to the French Revolution.

Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot|automobile]] (1771) and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]] (1783), were achieved by French scientists in the 18th century. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[rationalism|reason]] was advocated as the primary source for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[authority]], undermined the Absolute monarchy and prepared the French Revolution.

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Storming of the Bastille]], on 14 July 1789, was the starting event of the [[French Revolution]].]]
After the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, the absolute monarchy was abolished and France became a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Through the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the French Republic established fundamental rights for French citizens and all men without exception. The Declaration affirms "the natural and imprescriptible rights of man" to "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression". It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to exemptions from taxation, freedom and equal rights for all men, and access to public office based on talent rather than birth. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process. Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. The Declaration also asserted the principles of popular sovereignty, in contrast to the divine right of kings that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, eliminating the privileges of the nobility and clergy.

In 1792, the French Republic was proclaimed. As European [[War of the First Coalition|monarchies attacked]] the new Republic to restore the French monarchy, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and his wife, [[Marie Antoinette]], were convicted of [[treason]] and [[guillotined]] in 1793. Facing increasing pressures from European monarchies and facing internal guerrilla wars and [[counterrevolution]]s, like the [[War in the Vendée]] or the [[Chouannerie]], the young Republic fell into the [[Reign of Terror]], between 1793 and 1794, where 16,000 to 40,000 persons were executed. In Western France, the [[civil war]] between the ''Bleus'' (the "Blues", supporters of the Revolution) and the ''Blancs'' (the "Whites", supporters of the Monarchy) last from 1793 to 1796 and cost around 450,000 lives (200,000 ''Patriotes'' and 250,000 ''Vendéens'').<ref>{{cite news

After a [[French Directory|short-lived governmental scheme]],  Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799, making himself [[First Consul]], and later [[Emperor]] of the First Empire (1804–1814/1815).
As a continuation of [[French Revolutionary Wars|the wars]] sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of [[Napoleonic Wars|European Coalitions]] declared wars to Napoleon's French Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe, with members of the [[Bonaparte]] family being appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. After the catastrophic [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]], Napoleon was finally defeated and the Bourbon monarchy [[restored]].

After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the monarchy was [[Bourbon Restoration|re-established]] (1815–1830), but with new constitutional limitations. The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution|civil uprising of 1830]], which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]], which lasted until 1848, when the [[French Second Republic]] was proclaimed. In 1852, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I’s nephew, proclaimed the second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied the French interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], in [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]] but was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian war]] of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].

France had [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century until the 1960s. In the 19th and 20th centuries, its [[global Empire|global overseas colonial empire]] was the second largest in the world behind the [[British Empire]]. At its peak, between 1919 and 1939, the second French colonial empire extended over 12,347,000 square kilometres (4,767,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of land. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total area of land under French [[sovereignty]] reached 12,898,000 square kilometres (4,980,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in the 1920s and 1930s, which is 8.6% of the world's land area.

France was a member of the [[Triple Entente]] when [[World War I]] broke out. A small part of Northern France was occupied, but France and its allies eventually emerged victorious against the  [[Central Powers]], at a tremendous human and material cost: the first war left 1.4&nbsp;million French soldiers dead.<ref>{{cite news

{{Main|Administrative divisions of France|Regions of France|Departments of France}}
{{See also|Metropolitan Area (France)|List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants (1999 census)}}

France is divided into 26 administrative [[Regions of France|regions]].<ref name= France/> 22 are in [[metropolitan France]] (21 are on the continental part of metropolitan France; one is the territorial collectivity of [[Corsica]]), and four are [[overseas region]]s. The regions are further subdivided into 100 [[Departments of France|departments]]<ref>[http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php Departments of France] - My French Property</ref> which are numbered (mainly alphabetically). This number is used in postal codes and vehicle number plates amongst others. The 100 departments are subdivided into 341 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]] which are, in turn, subdivided into 4,032 [[Cantons of France|cantons]]. These cantons are then divided into 36,680 [[Communes of France|communes]], which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. There also exist 2,588 [[Communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] entities grouping 33,414 of the 36,680 communes (i.e. 91.1% of all the communes). Three communes, Paris, Lyon and Marseille are also subdivided into 45 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]].

The regions, departments and communes are all known as [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were also territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and definitely abolished by the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946. Historically, the cantons were also territorial collectivities with their elected assemblies.

{{Main|Overseas departments and territories of France}}

Among the 100 departments of France, four ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], and [[Réunion]]) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously [[overseas department]]s (DOMs) and are an integral part of France (and the European Union) and thus enjoy a status similar to metropolitan departments.

In addition to the 26 regions and 100 departments, the French Republic also has six [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]] ([[French Polynesia]], [[Mayotte]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]), one ''[[sui generis]]'' collectivity ([[New Caledonia]]), one [[overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] ([[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean ([[Clipperton Island]]).

[[File:Logo de la République française.svg|thumb|left|Logo of the French Republic]]

The French Republic is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]] with strong [[democratic]] traditions. The [[Constitution of France|constitution]] of the Fifth Republic was approved by [[referendum]] on 28 September 1958.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3305,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html France: Fifth Republic] - [http://flagspot.net/flags/index.html Flags of the World]</ref> It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to [[Government of France#Legislative branch|parliament]]. The executive branch itself has two leaders: the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]], currently [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who is [[head of state]] and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years),<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/quinquennat/chronologie.shtml Le quinquennat : le référendum du 24 Septembre 2000]</ref> and the Government, led by the president-appointed [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], currently [[François Fillon]].

[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy (2008).jpg|thumb|upright|Nicolas Sarkozy has been the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]] since 2007]]

The French [[Parliament of France|parliament]] is a [[bicameral]] legislature comprising a [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée Nationale'') and a [[Senate of France|Senate]].<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/synthetic_files/file_4.asp The National Assembly and the Senate - General Characteristics of the Parliament] on the [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/index.asp Official Site of the French National Assembly]</ref> The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms.<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/election.asp#election Election of deputies] on the [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/index.asp Official Site of the National Assembly]</ref> The Assembly has the power to dismiss the cabinet, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/election_senateurs.html The senatorial elections] - on the [http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/index.html Official Site of the Senate]</ref>

French politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred around the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]], and the other right-wing, centred previously around the [[Rally for the Republic|Rassemblement pour la République (RPR)]] and now its successor the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]].<ref>{{fr}} {{cite book |title=La France vers le bipartisme ? : La présidentialisation du PS et de l'UMP|last=Grunberg |first=Gérard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher= |location= |isbn=2724610105|page= |pages= |url=http://www.pressesdesciencespo.fr/fr/livre/?GCOI=27246100617740|accessdate=}}</ref> The executive branch is currently composed mostly of the UMP.

Law

<text>

{{Main|Law of France}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]

France uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal]] system;<ref name=France/> that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judge interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]). Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]]. In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], wrote about the management of prisons: :''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''
That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.

French law is divided into two principal areas: [[private law]] and [[public law]]. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and [[criminal law]]. Public law includes, in particular, [[administrative law]] and [[constitutional law]]. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law and administrative law.

France does not recognise [[religious law]], nor does it recognise religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, "offences against [[public decency]]" (''contraires aux bonnes mœurs'') or [[breach of the peace|disturbing public order]] (''trouble à l'ordre public'') have been used to repress public expressions of [[homosexuality]] or street [[prostitution]].

Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws are prohibited) ; and to be applicable, laws must be officially published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]''.

France is tolerant of the [[LGBT community]]. Since 1999, [[Pacte civil de solidarité|civil unions]] for homosexual couples are permitted, although [[same-sex marriage]] is illegal in France. Laws sentencing [[racism]], [[sexism]] or [[antisemitism]] are old and important, for instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.ambafrance-dz.org/ambassade/IMG/Lutte_racisme_et_antisemitisme.pdf La lutte contre le racisme et l'antisémintisme en France] - AmbaFrance</ref> France is one of the most tolerant countries of the world, religiously speaking, according to a survey conducted in 15 different countries.<ref>[http://www.ambafrance-gh.org/spip.php?article469 High degree of tolerance in France] - AmbaFrance</ref> French Muslims are also more tolerant than British Muslims are.<ref>{{cite news|author=Riazat Butt, Religious affairs correspondent |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality |title=Muslims in Britain have zero tolerance of homosexuality, says poll |publisher=Guardian |date= 7 May 2009|accessdate=9 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

Some of the French designed equipments are specifically designed for exports like the Franco-Spanish [[Scorpène class submarine|''Scorpène'' class submarine]]s. Some French equipments have been largely modified to fit allied countries' requirements like the [[Formidable class frigate|''Formidable'' class frigate]]s (based on the ''La Fayette'' class) or the [[Agosta 90B class submarine|''Hashmat'' class submarines]] (based on the ''Agosta'' class submarines).

* Although it includes very competent anti-terrorist units such as the [[GIGN]] or the [[Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale|EPIGN]], the gendarmerie is a military police force which serves for the most part as a rural and general purpose police force. Since its creation the GIGN has taken part in roughly one thousand operations and freed over five-hundred hostages; the [[Air France Flight 8969]]'s hijacking brought them to the world's attention with a very successful antiterrorist operation.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,163487,00.html Anatomy of a Hijack] - Time</ref>
* French intelligence consists of two major units: the [[Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure|DGSE]] (the external agency) and the [[Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur|DCRI]] (domestic agency). The latter being part of the police while the former is associated to the army. The DGSE is notorious for the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|Sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']], but it is also known for revealing the most extensive technological spy network uncovered in Europe and the United States to date through the [[mole (espionage)|mole]] [[Vladimir Vetrov]].

* The French deterrence, (formerly known as “''[[Force de frappe]]''”), relies on a complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four submarines equipped with [[M45 SLBM|M45]] ballistic missiles. The current [[Le Triomphant class submarine|''Triomphant'']] class is currently under deployment to replace the former [[Le Redoutable class submarine|''Redoutable'']] class. The [[M51 SLBM|M51]] will replace the M45 in the future and expand the ''Triomphant''s firing range. Aside of the submarines the French dissuasion force uses the [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]]; it is a variant of the Mirage 2000 and thus is designed to deliver nuclear strikes. Other nuclear devices like the Plateau d'Albion's [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]] and the short range [[Hadès (missile)|Hadès]] missiles have been disarmed. With 350 nuclear heads stockpiled France is the world's third largest nuclear power.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/summary.htm Comparison of recognised and alleged nuclear powers].</ref>
* The [[Marine Nationale]] is regarded as one of the world's most powerful navies. The professional compendium ''flottes de combats'', in its 2006 edition, ranked it the world's 6th biggest navy after the American, Russian, Chinese, British and Japanese navies.<ref>{{fr}} {{cite web|url=http://www.meretmarine.com/article.cfm?id=958|title=La marine chinoise accède au rang de 3ème puissance mondiale}}</ref>

It is equipped with the only non-American nuclear powered Aircraft Carrier in the world. Recently [[Mistral class landing platform dock|''Mistral'']] class ships joined the Marine Nationale, the Mistral itself having taken part in operations in Lebanon. For the 2004 centennial of the [[Entente Cordiale]] President Chirac announced the [[Future French aircraft carrier]] would be jointly designed with Great Britain. The French navy is equipped with the [[La Fayette class frigate|''La Fayette'' class frigate]]s, early examples of stealth ships, and several ships are expected to be retired in the next few years and replaced by more modern ships, examples of future surface ships are the [[Horizon class frigate|Forbin]] and the [[FREMM multipurpose frigate|''Aquitaine'']] class frigates. The attack submarines are also part of the [[Force Océanique Stratégique]] although they do not carry the nuclear dissuasion, the current class is the [[Rubis class submarine|''Rubis'' Class]] and will be replaced in the future by the expected [[French Barracuda class submarine|''Suffren'' Class]].

* The ''Armée de Terre'' employs as of 2009 123,100 people.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/directions-commandements-et-centres/ressources-humaines/direction-des-ressources-humaines-de-l-armee-de-terre Direction des ressources humaines de l'armée de Terre] - [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ Ministère de la Défense]</ref> It is famous for the ''[[French Foreign Legion|Légion Etrangère]]'' (French Foreign Legion) though the French special forces are not the Legion but the [[13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment|Dragons Parachutistes]] and the [[1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment|Marines Parachutistes]]. The French assault rifle is the [[FAMAS (rifle)|FAMAS]] and future infantry combat system is the [[Félin]]. France uses both tracked and wheeled vehicles to a significant points, examples of wheeled vehicles would be the [[Camion équipé d'un système d'artillerie|Caesar]] or the [[AMX 10 RC]]. Although its main battle tank is the Leclerc many older [[AMX 30]] tanks are still operational. It uses the [[AMX 30 AuF1]] for artillery and is equipped with Eurocopter Tigers helicopters.
* The Armée de l'Air is the oldest and first professional air force worldwide.<ref>[http://www.military-aircraft.org/france/french-military-aircraft.php French Military Aircraft] - Military Aircraft</ref> It still today retains a significant capacity. It uses mainly two aircraft fighters: the older [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1]] and the more recent [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]]. The later model exists in a ground attack version called the Mirage2000D. The modern [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] is in deployment in both the French air force and navy.

According to Article 2 of the Constitution, the official language of France is [[French language|French]],<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/constitution/constitution2.htm#titre2 La Constitution- La Constitution du 4 Octobre 1958] - Légifrance</ref>  a [[Romance language]] derived from [[latin]]. Since 1635, the [[Académie française]] is France's official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal power.

The [[French government]] does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the [[European Union]] and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]]. The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority [[languages of France]], 8 in the French metropolitan territory of continental Europe and 69 in the French [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]].

From the 17th century to the mid 20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a [[lingua franca]] among the educated classes of Europe.<ref name=exception>[http://www.franceinlondon.co.uk/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declininge-Culture--london-language.htm ls the French obsession with "cultural exception" declining?]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} France in London</ref> The dominant position of French language in international affairs has only been challenged recently by English, since the emergence of the USA as a major power.<ref name="Language and Diplomacy"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomacy.edu/language/Translation/default.htm |title=Language and Diplomacy - Translation and Interpretation |publisher=Diplomacy.edu |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/language-of-diplomacy/ |title=Why Is French Considered the Language of Diplomacy? |publisher=Legallanguage.com |date= |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref>

As a result of France's extensive [[French colonial empire|colonial ambitions]] between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to America, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean. French is the second most-studied foreign language in the world after English,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intstudy.com/articles/practicalfrench.htm |title=The International Education Site |publisher=Intstudy.com |date= |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> and is a [[lingua franca]] in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies ([[Southeast Asia]]), while creoles, and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the [[West Indies]] and the South Pacific ([[French Polynesia]]). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in [[Africa]].

France is a [[secular]] country, and freedom of religion is a constitutional right. The French government does not keep [[statistics]] on religious adherence, nor on ethnicity or on political affiliation.  However, some unofficial survey estimates exist.

[[Roman Catholicism]] has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practiced today as it once was. A survey by the Catholic newspaper ''[[La Croix]]'' found that whilst in 1965, 81% of the French declared themselves to be Catholics, in 2009 this proportion was 64%. Moreover, whilst 27% of the French went to Mass once a week or more in 1952, only 4.5% did so in 2006; 15.2% attended Mass at least once a month.<ref name=catho>{{fr}} [http://www.la-croix.com/La-France-reste-catholique-mais-moins-pratiquante/article/2407513/4078 La France reste catholique mais moins pratiquante] - La Croix</ref> The same survey found that [[Protestantism|Protestants]] accounted for 3% of the population, an increase from previous surveys, and 5% adhered to other religions, with the remaining 28% stating that they had no religion.<ref name=catho/>

According to a January 2007 poll by the Catholic World News,<ref>{{cite web |author=Catholic World News |publisher= |year=2003 |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=48547 |title=France is no longer Catholic, survey shows |accessdate=19 December 2009}}</ref> only 5% of the French population attended church regularly (or 10% attend church services regularly among the respondents who did identify themselves as Catholics).

Meanwhile, an independent estimate by the politologist Pierre Bréchon in 2009 concluded that the proportion of Catholics had fallen to 42% while the number of atheists and agnostics had risen to 50%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2389007&rubId=786 |title=« Sur la religion, les Français restent dubitatifs » - A la Une |publisher=la-Croix.com |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref>

According to the most recent but in 2010 somewhat outdated [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005,<ref name=EUROBAROMETER>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 – page 11|accessdate=5 May 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> 34% of French citizens responded that “they believe there is a god”, whereas 27% answered that “they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force” and 33% that “they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force”. One other study shows 32% of people in France declaring themselves to be [[atheists]], and another 32% declaring themselves “sceptical about the existence of God but not an atheist”.<ref>[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country], Financial Times/Harris Poll, December 2006</ref>

Estimates of the number of [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] vary widely. According to the more than one decade old 1999 French census returns, there were 3.7&nbsp;million people of “possible Muslim faith” in France (6.3% of the total population). In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of Muslims to be between five and six million (8–10%).<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/apr/23/france.islam France to train imams in 'French Islam'], The Guardian</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51552.htm |title=France – International Religious Freedom Report 2005 |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> The current [[Jews in France|Jewish community in France]] numbers around 600,000 according to the [[World Jewish Congress]] and is the largest in Europe.

Since 1905 the French government has followed the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'', in which it is prohibited from recognising any ''religion'' (except for legacy statutes like that of military [[chaplain]]s and the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] in [[Alsace-Moselle]]). Instead, it merely recognises ''religious organisations'', according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organizations should refrain from intervening in policy-making.

Certain bodies of beliefs such as [[Scientology]], [[Children of God (New Religious Movement)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], or the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] are considered [[cult]]s ("''[[sect#Corresponding words in other European languages|sectes]]''" in French),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |title=Commission d’enquête sur les sectes |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> and therefore do not have the same status as religions in France.

France has been a center of cultural creation for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still much recognized and admired in the world for its very rich cultural tradition.

The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting [[Monument historique|historical monuments]]. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a [[cultural exception]] to defend audiovisual products made in the country.

France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 [[List of museums in France|museums]] welcoming more than 50&nbsp;million people annually.<ref>Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, "Cultura statistics", [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/culture/deps/2008/pdf/minichiffrescles2010-en.pdf Key figures]</ref> The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency [[Centre des monuments nationaux]], which have around a hundred national historical monuments at charge.{{clarify|What does 'at charge' mean?

{{Main|French painting}}
[[File:Claude Monet 023.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]] founded the [[Impressionist]] movement (''Femme avec un parasol'', 1886, [[Musée d'Orsay]]).]]
The origins of [[French painting]] were very much influenced by [[Italian art]]. The two most famous French artists of the time of [[Renaissance]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-in-activity [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists. French painting also followed the evolution of Italian painters towards a rococo style in the 18th century, as an imitation of old baroque style, the works of court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon I]] favoured painters of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] as [[Jacques-Louis David]]. The middle of the eighteen century was dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], a more realistic painting with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-François Millet]].

In the second part of the 18th century, France became a center of artistic creation, developing a new style of painting and counting on the most famous impressionist painters of the period, among them [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], Claude Monet, [[Auguste Renoir]].<ref>The National Gallery of London official website, [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/guide-to-impressionism/guide-to-impressionism Guide to Impressionism]</ref> Second generation of impressionist-style painters [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Georges Seurat]] were also at the avant-guarde of artistic evolutions,<ref>{{fr}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/063/article_34792.asp Le néo-impressionnisme de Seurat à Paul Klee] 15/03/2005</ref> as well as [[fauvism|fauvist artists]] [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]].<ref>National Gallery of Art (United States), [http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm The Fauves (dossier)]</ref><ref>{{fr}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/culturefr/articles/098/article_63189.asp Vlaminck, version fauve], 25/02/2008</ref> At the beginning of 20th century, Cubism was developed by [[Georges Braque]] and Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]], living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned [[Musée du Louvre]], such as [[Mona Lisa]], also known as [[La Joconde]]. While the [[Louvre Palace]] has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station [[Gare d'Orsay]], in a major reorganization of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).<ref>Musée d'Orsay (official website), History of the museum - [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-museum/home.html From station to museum]</ref><ref>Musée d'Orsay official website, [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-collections/painting.html History of the painting collection]</ref> Modern works are presented in the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], which moved in 1976 to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]].

{{Main|French architecture}}
Technically speaking, there is no standard type of "French" architecture, although that has not always been true. [[Gothic Architecture]]'s old name was ''French Architecture'' (or Opus Francigenum).<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/opus-francigenum-art Opus Francigenum] - Answers.com</ref> The term “Gothic” appeared later as a stylistic insult and was widely adopted. The Gothic Architecture was the first French style of Architecture to be copied in all Europe.<ref>[http://www.justfrance.org/france/architecture/001.asp The Gothic period] - France Travel</ref> Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic [[cathedrals]] and [[basilicas]], the first of these being the [[Saint Denis Basilica]] (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are [[Cathedral of Chartres|Notre-Dame de Chartres]] and [[Amiens Cathedral|Notre-Dame d'Amiens]]. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: [[Notre-Dame de Reims]].<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.cathedrale-reims.culture.fr/histoire.html Histoire et Architecture] - [http://www.cathedrale-reims.culture.fr/ Site officiel de la Cathedrale de Notre-Dame de Reims]</ref> Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the [[Palais des Papes]] in Avignon.
[[File:Sainte chapelle - Upper level.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis']] [[Sainte Chapelle]] represents the French impact on religious architecture.]]
During the Middle Ages, fortified [[castle]]s were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals. When [[Philip II of France|King Philip II]] took [[Rouen]] from [[John of England|King John]], for example, he demolished the ducal castle to build a bigger one. Fortified cities were also common, unfortunately most French castles did not survive the passage of time. This is why [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart's]] [[Château Gaillard]] was demolished, as well as the [[Château de Lusignan]]. Some important French castles that survived are [[Chinon (castle)|Chinon]], [[Château d'Angers]], the massive [[Château de Vincennes]] and the so called [[Cathar castles]].

Before the appearance of this architecture France had been using [[Romanesque architecture]] like most of Western Europe (with the exception of the Iberian Peninsula, which used Mooresque architecture, which now consists of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]). Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint Sernin Basilica]] in [[Toulouse, France|Toulouse]] (largest romanesque church in Europe<ref>[http://www.europeupclose.com/france/southwest-france/toulouses-saint-sernin-largest-romanesque-church-in-europe/ Toulouse’s Saint Sernin, Largest Romanesque Church in Europe] - EuropeUpClose</ref>) and the remains of the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac Abbey]] (largely destroyed during the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars).

[[File:Le grand foyer-2.jpg|thumb|[[Opéra Garnier]], Paris, a symbol of the French [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] style]]

The end of the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the [[French Renaissance]] and several artists from [[Italy]] and Spain were invited to the French court; many residential palaces, inspired by the Italians, were built, but mainly in the [[Loire Valley]]. Such residential castles were the [[Château de Chambord]], the [[Château de Chenonceau]], or the [[Château d'Amboise]]. Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, [[Baroque Architecture]] replaced the traditional gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.<ref>{{fr}} Claude Lébedel – Les Splendeurs du Baroque en France: ''Histoire et splendeurs du baroque en France'' page 9: “Si en allant plus loin, on prononce les mots ‘art baroque en France’, on provoque alors le plus souvent une moue interrogative, parfois seulement étonnée, parfois franchement réprobatrice: Mais voyons, l'art baroque n'existe pas en France!”</ref> In the secular domain the [[Palace of Versailles]] has many [[baroque era|baroque]] features. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] was said to be the most influential French architect of the baroque era, with his famous dome, [[Les Invalides]]. Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the [[Place Stanislas]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. On the military architectural side, [[Vauban]] designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can been found all over Europe, the [[Americas]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1283 |title=Fortifications of Vauban |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/ |title=Official site of the UNESCO |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref>

After the Revolution the [[Republicanism|Republicans]] favoured [[Neoclassicism]] although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the [[Panthéon, Paris|Parisian Pantheon]] or the [[Capitole de Toulouse]]. Built during the French Empire the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Église de la Madeleine|Sainte Marie-Madeleine]] represent this trend the best.<ref>{{cite book |title= Paris: City Guide |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2008 |publisher= Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=1740598504|page= 48 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=OtabdzMdbboC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=arc+de+triomphe+neoclassicism+sainte+marie+madeleine&q|accessdate=}}</ref>

Under [[Napoleon III]] a new wave of [[urbanism]] and architecture was given birth. If extravagant buildings such as the [[neo-baroque]] [[Palais Garnier]] were built, the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} For example, [[Baron Haussmann]] [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|rebuilt Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France the associated architect was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designer of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower.

In the 20th century, [[Swiss]] Architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. Certainly the most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in [[Paris]], since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters, or 121 feet.<ref>[http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html Des gratte-ciel à Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?] - [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]]</ref> France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.<ref>[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] - NCI Business Center</ref> Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; a good example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]]. Some famous modern French architects include [[Jean Nouvel]] or [[Paul Andreu]].

The earliest French literature dates from the [[Middle Age]]s, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects and each writer used his own spelling and grammar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as [[Tristan and Iseult]] and [[Lancelot and the Holy Grail]]. Much mediaeval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as [[The Song of Roland]] and the various [[Chansons de geste]]. The “Roman de Renart”, written in 1175 by [[Perrout de Saint Cloude]] tells the story of the mediaeval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. The names of some authors from this period are known, for example [[Chrétien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].

An important 16th century writer was [[François Rabelais]] who influenced modern French vocabulary and metaphor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During the 17th century, plays by [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and Molière, as well as the moral and philosophical books by [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[René Descartes]], deeply influenced the French aristocracy leaving an important new niche for authors of the following decades, such as [[Jean de La Fontaine]], who was an important poet from this century.

French literature and poetry flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 18th century saw the works of writers, essayists and moralists such as [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. [[Charles Perrault]] was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including “[[Puss in Boots]]”, “[[Cinderella]]”, “[[Sleeping Beauty]]” and “[[Bluebeard]]”.

[[File:Charles Baudelaire2.jpg|thumb|upright|19th century poet, writer, and translator [[Charles Baudelaire]].]]

At the turn of the 19th century [[symbolist poetry]] was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}<ref>{{fr}} [http://users.skynet.be/litterature/symbolisme/symbolismefrancais.htm Le symbolisme français]</ref> The 19th century saw the writings of French authors: Victor Hugo (''[[Les Misérables]]''), [[Alexandre Dumas]] (''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte-Cristo]]''), and [[Jules Verne]] (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''), which are amongst the most well-known in France and the world. Other 19th century fiction writers include [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Stendhal]].

{{Main|Music of France}}
Although the musical creation in France dates back to the Middle Ages, it knew its golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed several musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[François Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the "Roi Soleil", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. French classical music knew a revival in the 19th and 20th century, at the end of the romantic movement, at first with opera composers [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Georges Bizet]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Édouard Lalo]], [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]. This period was a golden age for operas, being popular in the country the [[opéra bouffon]], the [[opera-ballet]] and the [[opéra comique]] genres. Later came precursors of modern classical music [[Érik Satie]], [[Francis Poulenc]], and above all [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]], who invented new musical forms.<ref>NPR (website), [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4957580 Debussy's 'La Mer' Marks 100th Birthday], 14 October 2005</ref><ref>NPR (website), [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92338564 Debussy's Musical Game of Deception], 12 July 2008</ref><ref>Classic fM website, [http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/c-g/claude-debussy/ Biography of Claude Debussy]</ref><ref>Classic fM website, [http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/n-r/maurice-ravel/ Biography of Maurice Ravel]</ref> More recently, at the middle of the 20th century, [[Maurice Ohana]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] contributed to the evolutions of [[contemporary classical music]].<ref>NPR (website), [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126668117 Composer-Conductor Pierre Boulez At 85], 24 May 2010</ref>

France has historical and strong links with [[Filmmaking|cinema]]. It is two [[Frenchmen]], Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the [[Lumiere Brothers]]) who created the cinema in 1895.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Lumière/130661 Les frères Lumière]</ref> More recently, in 2006, France produced more films than any other European country.<ref>[http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx Cinema: production of feature films] - UNESCO</ref> [[Cannes Festival]] is one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.<ref>[http://www.cannesguide.com/basics/ Cannes - a festival virgin's guide] - CannesGuide</ref><ref>[http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&event_id=21731 Cannes Film Festival] - www.whatsonwhen.com</ref>

Although the French film market is dominated by [[Hollywood]], it is however the Western country (out of the United States) where the share of the American films in the total film revenues is the smallest, at 50.1%, to compare with 77.3% of Germany and 69.4% of Japan.<ref name = erudit>{{fr}} [http://www.erudit.org/revue/hphi/2005/v15/n2/801295ar.pdf] « Cinéma et diversité culturelle : le cinéma indépendant face à la mondialisation des industries

France was for centuries, and not so long ago, the cultural center of the world.<ref name=exception/> But France's dominant position has been overthrown by [[American culture]], and thus France tries to protect its culture. France has been a strong advocate of the [[cultural exception]].<ref>[http://www.wolton.cnrs.fr/EN/collcom/ouvrages/fin_exc_cult.html The End of Cultural Exception ?]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} - [[CNRS]]</ref> France therefore succeeded in convincing all the EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalized sectors of the WTO in 1993.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/politique/diversite/wto-en2.htm The cultural exception is not negotiable by Catherine Trautmann] - Ministry of Culture</ref>

Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the [[UNESCO]] in 2005, and the principle of "cultural exception" won an overwhelming victory: 198 countries voted for it, only 2 countries, the U.S and Israel, voted against it.<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.fnsac-cgt.com/administration/upload/ARTICLE%20UNESCO%20CONF%201602_06%20(3).pdf La Convention UNESCO pour la diversité culturelle : vers un droit international culturel contraignant ?] - www.fnsac-cgt.com</ref>

[[File:Channel headquarters bordercropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chanel]]'s headquarters on the [[Place Vendôme]], [[Paris]].]]
Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern "haute couture" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression [[Haute couture]] is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

The association of France with fashion and style ({{lang-fr|la mode}}) dates largely to the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]<ref>Kelly, 181.  DeJean, chapters 2-4.</ref> when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang-fr|couture or haute couture}}) industry in the years 1860-1960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses such as Chanel, [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]], and [[Givenchy]].

In the 1960s, the elitist "Haute couture" came under criticism from France's [[May 1968 in France|youth culture]]. In 1966, the designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a [[prêt-à-porter]] ("ready to wear") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by [[Sonia Rykiel]], [[Thierry Mugler]], [[Claude Montana]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Christian Lacroix]] in the 1970s and 80s.  The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as [[LVMH]].

Compared to other developed countries, the French do not spend much time reading newspapers, due to the popularity of broadcast media. Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are ''[[Le Monde]]''  and right-wing ''[[Le Figaro]]'', with around 300.000 copies sold daily, but also ''[[L'Équipe]]'', dedicated to sports coverage.<ref>{{fr}} OJD, "Observatoire de la Presse", [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PQN/ Presse Quotidienne Nationale]</ref> In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'', ''[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Direct Plus]]'' distributed at more than 650.000 copies respectively.<ref>{{fr}} OJD, [http://www.ojd.com/pgi/section/ Presse Gratuite d'Information]</ref> However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily ''[[Ouest France]]'' with more than 750.000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales.<ref>{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PQRD/ Presse Quotidienne Régionale et Départementale]</ref><ref>{{fr}} OJD, "Bureau Presse Payante Grand Public", [http://www.ojd.com/chiffres/section/PPGP/print?submitted=1&section=PPGP&famille=2&thema=&search=&go=Lancer+la+recherche Presse Quotidienne Régionale et Départementale]</ref> The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country.<ref>{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PMAG/ Presse Magazine - Synthèse]</ref>

The most influential news magazine are left-wing ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', centrist ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' and right-wing ''[[Le Point]]'' (more than 400.000 copies),<ref>{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_NEWS/ Presse News]</ref> but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women’s magazines, among them ''[[Marie Claire]]'' and ''[[ELLE]]'', which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'' and ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', as well as ''[[Paris Match]]''. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a [[Newspaper crisis|severe crisis]] in the past decade. In 2008, the government have launched a major initiative to help the sector reform to be financially independent,<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3125110/Nicolas-Sarkozy-French-media-faces-death-without-reform.html Nicolas Sarkozy: French media faces 'death' without reform] 2 October 2008</ref><ref>French government portal, [http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/lancement-des-etats-generaux-de-la-presse Lancement des états généraux de la presse] 2 October 2008 [Launching of General State of written media]</ref> but in 2009 it had to give 600.000 euros to help the print media cope with the [[Global financial crisis of 2008-2009|economic crisis]], in addition to existing subsidies.<ref>[[Angelique Chrisafis]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jan/23/sarkozy-pledges-state-aid-to-newspapers Sarkozy pledges €600m to newspapers], 23 January 2009.</ref>

In 1974, after years of centralized monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency [[ORTF]] was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations<ref>Radio France, "L'entreprise", [http://www.radiofrance.fr/lentreprise/reperes/statuts/ Repères] [Landmarks of Radio France company]</ref><ref name=mediapol>{{fr}} Vie Publique, [http://www.vie-publique.fr/politiques-publiques/politique-audiovisuel/chronologie/ Chronologie de la politique de l’audiovisuel] 20/08/2004 [Chronology of policy for audiovisual]</ref> remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 when the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio.<ref name=mediapol/> French television was partly liberalized in the next two decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre]] introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.

The four existing national channels are now owned by state-owned consortium [[France Télévisions]], while public broadcasting group [[Radio France]] run five national radio stations. Among these public media are [[Radio France Internationale]], which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel [[TV5 Monde]]. In 2006, the government created global news channel [[France 24]]. Long-established TV channels [[TF1]] (privatized in 1987), [[France 2]] and [[France 3]] have the highest shares, while  radio stations [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]], [[Europe 1]] and state-owned [[France Inter]] are the least listened to.

A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the  [[Gallic rooster]]. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both "rooster" and "inhabitant of Gaul". Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.<ref>{{fr}} French Presidency, "Les symboles de la République française", [http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-coq/le-coq.6052.html Le coq]</ref> Although it is not an official symbol of the Republic, it is the most common image to symbolize France in the collective imagination and abroad.

* France is the home of the [[International System of Units]] (the metric system).<ref>[http://www.nist.gov/physlab/div842/fcdc/si-units.cfm International System of Units (SI)] - Physics Laboratory</ref> Some pre-metric units are still used, essentially the ''[[Pound (mass)#French livre|livre]]'' (a unit of weight equal to half a kilogram) and the ''[[quintal]]'' (a unit of weight equal to 100 kilograms).
* In [[mathematics]], France uses the [[infix notation]] like most countries. For large numbers the [[long and short scales|long scale]] is used. Thus, the French use the word ''[[billion (word)|billion]]'' for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using [[Long and short scales|short scale]] is called a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]. However, there exists a French word, ''milliard'', for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite the use of the long scale, one billion is called ''un milliard'' ("one milliard") in French, and not ''mille millions'' ("one thousand million"). It should also be noted that names of numbers above the ''milliard'' are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called ''mille milliards'' (“one thousand milliard”) in French, and rarely ''un billion''.
* In the French numeral notation, the comma (,) is the [[decimal separator]], whereas a space is used between each group of three digits (fifteen million five hundred thousand and thirty-two should be written as 15 500 032). In finance, the currency symbol is used as a decimal separator or put after the number. For example, €25,048.05 is written either 25 048€05 or 25 048,05 € (always with an extra space between the figure and the currency symbol).
* In computing, a [[bit]] is called a bit yet a [[byte]] is called an [[octet (computing)|octet]]<ref>[http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/octet English translation of "Octet"] on [http://dictionary.reverso.net/ Reverso]</ref> (from the Latin root ''octo'', meaning "8"). [[SI prefix]]es are used.
* [[24-hour clock]] time is used, with h being the separator between hours and minutes (for example 2:30&nbsp;pm is 14h30).
* The all-numeric form for dates is in the order day-month-year, using a slash as the separator (example: 31/12/1992 or 31/12/92).
