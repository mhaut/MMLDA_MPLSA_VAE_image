There are various theories about the origin of the word ''Chile''.

Original settlement and Spanish colonization
</heading>
<text>

About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Example settlement sites from the very early human habitation are [[Monte Verde]], [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]]. The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the Mapuche (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=inca+did+not+conquer+araucanians |title=Chile – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2002-12-20|accessdate=2009-12-17|isbn=9789812348906}}</ref> They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him, the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking [[gold]]. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn [[agriculture]] and [[hunting]]. The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on February 12, 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and [[silver]] they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>
[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pedro de Valdivia]]
[[File:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]], Supreme Director of Chile]]

Conquest of the land took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the local population. A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite the royal prohibitions relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=Bárbaros, page 66. David J. Weber |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. In addition to the Mapuche, buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Because Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, it was one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name="hudson"/> By the end of the colonial period, the population reached an estimated 500,000 (not including unsubjugated Indians); approximately 300,000 of which were [[mestizo]]s and about 150,000 of which were [[Criollo people|Criollos]] (European or [[Europe|European descent]]).<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111326/Chile Chile]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online.</ref>

The first general census was performed by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778. The census indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5% of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9% [[mestizo]]s, 8.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and 9.8% [[black]]s. In 1784, ''Francisco Hurtado'', [[Governor]] of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a population census and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4% of which were whites and 33.5% of which were natives.

Finally, in 1812, the Diocese of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] conducted a census of areas south of the [[Maule river]], but did not include the indigenous population (estimated at 8,000 people), or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé, (and estimated population of 210,567, 86.1% of which were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10% of which were Indians and 3.7% of which were [[mestizo]]s, [[black people|blacks]] and [[mulatto]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/usuarios/cedoc_online/censos/pdf/censo_1813.pdf |title=INE – Censo de 1813.

Independence
</heading>
<text>

The usurpation of the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish throne]] by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] in 1808 precipitated the drive by the colony for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. A national junta in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on September 18, 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish [[monarchy]] (in memory of this day Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on September 18 each year). After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On February 12, 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name="countrystudies"/>
[[File:Combate naval.jpg|thumb|War of the Pacific: The [[Battle of Iquique]] on May 21, 1879]]

Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by ruthlessly suppressing the Mapuche during the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. In 1881, it signed a treaty with Argentina confirming Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

The [[Chilean Civil War]] in 1891 brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors.

20th century
</heading>
<text>

The Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and [[working class]]es were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. The longest lasting of the ten governments between those years was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship, although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America .<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Geenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0313298432|pages=30–96}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Salt in the sand|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Duke University|isbn=0822340038|pages=163–184}}</ref>
By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name="countrystudies">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830-1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=1994-03-31}}</ref>
[[File:S.Allende 7 dias ilustrados.JPG|thumb|upright|President Salvador Allende]]
In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (part of the "[[Popular Unity]]" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name="countrystudies"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 355 votes. It became a war of classes, motivated by the central government.
Despite pressure from the [[United States]] government, the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri and keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the right-wing.<ref>{{Cite book

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 bottomed out in 1975, exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and [[unemployment]] rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=99ZLX52z_noC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=%C3%A1rea+de+propiedad+social |title=Politics in Chile: socialism ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17|isbn=9780813342276|year=2007}}</ref> Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment.<ref name="De Vylder">{{Cite book|title=Allende’s Chile: The political economy of the rise and fall of the Unidad Popular|last=De Vylder|first=Stefan|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]].

In the late 1980s, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and political activity.

[[File:Grey Glacier icebergs Stevage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grey Glacier]] in southern Chile]]

A long and narrow coastal [[Southern Cone]] country on the west side of the [[Andes Mountains]], Chile stretches over 4,630 kilometres (2,880&nbsp;mi) north to south, but only 430 kilometres (265&nbsp;mi) at its widest point east to west. This encompasses a remarkable variety of [[landscape]]s. It contains {{convert|756950|km2}} of land area. It is situated within the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Including its offshore islands, but excluding its Antarctic claim, Chile lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[56th parallel south|56°S]], and longitudes [[66th meridian east|66°]] and [[81st meridian east|81°W]].

The northern [[Atacama Desert]] contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, and also claims {{convert|1250000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[Antarctica]] as part of its territory. However, this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the [[Antarctic Treaty]], of which Chile is a signatory.<ref>{{cite web

Chile controls Easter Island and [[Sala y Gómez]] Island, the easternmost islands of Polynesia, which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], more than {{convert|600|km}} from the mainland, in the [[Juan Fernández Islands]]. [[Easter Island]] is today a province of Chile. Also controlled but only temporarily inhabited (by some local fishermen) are the small islands of Sala y Gómez, San Ambrosio and San Felix. These islands are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite book

<text>

{{Main|Climate of Chile}}The climate of Chile comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large geographic scale, extending across 38 degrees in latitude, making generalisations difficult. According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Chile within its borders hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes, ranging from [[desert]] in the north, to [[alpine tundra]] and glaciers in the east and south east, [[humid subtropical]] in Easter Island, [[oceanic climate|Oceanic]] in the south and Mediterranean climate in central Chile. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).

In southern Chile, south of the Biobío River, the heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.

The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina, indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation.<ref name=Bio&Con /> Chilean species include the [[araucaria araucana|monkey-puzzle tree]], part of the pine-like ''[[Araucaria]]'' genus centered in [[New Caledonia]], and [[nothofagus|southern beech]]es.

Chile's geographical isolation also has restricted the immigration of faunal life, so that only a few of the many distinctive Latin American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the [[Cougar|puma]] or cougar, the llama-like [[Guanaco]] and the fox-like [[South American Gray Fox|chilla]]. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the [[Pudú|pudu]] are found.<ref name= Icarito />
There are many species of small birds, but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent. Few freshwater fish are native, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes.<ref name= Icarito /> Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl, including different penguins. Whales are abundant, and some six species of seals are found in the area.<ref name= Icarito />

{{Main|Economy of Chile}}
[[Image:Titanium La Portada and Torre Gran Costanera, September 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Titanium La Portada]] (left) and [[Torre Gran Costanera]] (right) (September 2010).]]
Chile has a dynamic [[Market economy|market-oriented economy]] which is characterized by a high level of foreign trade. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of [[Patricio Aylwin]] – who took over from the military in 1990 – deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% from 1991–1997, but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies (implemented to keep the current account deficit in check) and because of lower export earnings – the latter which was a product of the Asian financial crisis. Chile's economy has since recovered and has seen growth rates of 5-7% over the past several years. In 2006, Chile became the country with the highest nominal GDP per capita in Latin America.<ref>http://www.weforum.org/pdf/GCR09/GCR20092010fullrankings.pdf</ref>

After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999, brought on by unfavorable global economic conditions related to the [[Asian financial crisis]], which began in 1997. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 4.0% real GDP growth.<ref>[http://indexmundi.com/chile/gdp_real_growth_rate.html] Chile GDP – real growth rate</ref> The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6.0%. Real GDP growth reached 5.7% in 2005 before falling back to 4.0% in 2006. GDP expanded by 5.1% in 2007.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

[[File:Chilean notes.jpg|thumb|left|Chilean notes currently in circulation (The 500 peso note is no longer in circulation)]]

Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates.<ref name=factbook/><ref name="countrystudies"/> The 1973-90 military government sold many state-owned companies, and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization, though at a slower pace. The government's role in the economy is mostly limited to regulation, although the state continues to operate copper giant CODELCO and a few other enterprises (there is one state-run bank). Chile is strongly committed to free trade and has welcomed large amounts of foreign investment. Chile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with a whole network of countries, including an FTA with the United States that was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004.<ref>[http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral/Chile_FTA/Final_Texts/Section_Index.html] USA-Chile FTA Final Text</ref>

Over the last several years, Chile has signed FTAs with the European Union, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, China, and Japan. It reached a partial trade agreement with India in 2005 and began negotiations for a full-fledged FTA with India in 2006. Chile conducted trade negotiations in 2007 with Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as with China to expand an existing agreement beyond just trade in goods. Chile concluded FTA negotiations with Australia and an expanded agreement with China in 2008. The members of the P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to conclude a chapter on finance and investment in 2008.<ref name="countrystudies"/> In May 2007 the international economic organization the [[OECD]] invited Chile to be among four countries to open discussions, and in May 2010 Chile became the first South American member of the OECD.<ref name="OECD_20100507" />

[[File:GDP per capita LA-Chile.png|thumb|350px|Chilean (blue) and average [[Latin America]]n (orange) [[GDP per capita]] (1950-2007).]]

High domestic savings and investment rates helped propel Chile's economy to average growth rates of 8% during the 1990s. [[Chile pension system|The privatized national pension system]] (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21% of GDP.<ref>[http://www.safp.cl/573/articles-3523_copyright.pdf] The Chilean pension system</ref>

Unemployment hovered at 8%-10% after the start of the economic slowdown in 1999, above the 7% average for the 1990s. Unemployment finally dipped to 7.8% in 2006, and continued to fall in 2007, averaging 6.8% monthly (up to August).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://si2.bcentral.cl/Basededatoseconomicos/951_417.asp?m=EMP03&f=M&i=E|title=Chilean Central Bank}}</ref> Wages have risen faster than inflation as a result of higher productivity, boosting national [[standard of living|living standards]]. The percentage of Chileans with household incomes below the [[poverty line]] – defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needs – fell from 45.1% in 1987 to 13.7% in 2006, according to government polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trabajoyequidad.cl/documentos/temp/TP-825-CASEN%202006%20en%20profundidad-22-06-2007.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025021053/http://www.trabajoyequidad.cl/documentos/temp/TP-825-CASEN+2006+en+profundidad-22-06-2007.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-25|work=Libertad y Desarrollo|title=Casen 2006 en profundidad|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=2007-06-22}}</ref> Critics in Chile, however, argue true that poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published. (The government constructs the poverty line based on an outdated 1987 household consumption poll, instead of more recent polls from 1997 or 2007). According to these critics who use data from the 1997 poll, the poverty rate rises to 29%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=35048|publisher=El Mercurio|title=Una muy necesaria corrección: Hay cuatro millones de pobres en Chile|date=2007-10-14|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Using the relative yardstick favoured in many European countries, 27% of Chileans would be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of the [[ECLAC]].<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=The Economist|title=Destitute no more|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9645174|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=2007-08-16}} {{Subscription}}</ref>

Chile's independent [[Central Bank]] pursues an inflation target of between 2% and 4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile registered an inflation rate of 3.2% in 2006. The Chilean peso's rapid appreciation against the U.S. dollar in recent years has helped dampen inflation. Most wage settlements and loans are indexed, reducing inflation's volatility. Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Total [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) was only $3.4 billion in 2006, up 52% from a poor performance in 2005. However, 80% of FDI continues to go to only four sectors: electricity, gas, water and mining. Much of the jump in FDI in 2006 was also the result of acquisitions and mergers, but has done little to create new employment in Chile. The Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition, which is tasked with identifying new sectors and industries to promote. It is hoped that this, combined with some tax reforms to encourage domestic and foreign investment in [[research and development]], will bring in additional FDI to new parts of the economy.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

As of 2006, Chile invested only 0.6% of its annual GDP in research and development (R&D). Even then, two-thirds of that was government spending. Beyond its general economic and political stability, the government has also encouraged the use of Chile as an "investment platform" for multinational corporations planning to operate in the region, but this will have limited value given the developing business climate in Chile itself. Chile's approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is reported to be simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Faced with an [[2008 financial crisis|international economic downturn]] the government announced a $4 billion economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth, and despite the global financial crisis, aimed for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3 percent of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/economicNews/idUSN1027661220090110 |title=Chile finmin says no recession seen in 2009-report |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-01-10 |accessdate=2009-12-17}}</ref> According to the CIA World FactBook, the GDP contracted an estimated -1.7% in 2009.

2006 was a record year for Chilean trade. Total trade registered a 31% increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US $58 billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical high of US $33.3 billion. Imports totaled US $35 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US $23 billion in 2006.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US $39 billion), Asia (US $27.8 billion) and Europe (US $22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile's export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to Europe. Within Chile's diversified network of trade relationships, its most important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was US $14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.-Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Total trade with Europe also grew in 2006, expanding by 42%. The Netherlands and Italy were Chile's main European trading partners. Total trade with Asia also grew significantly at nearly 31%. Trade with Korea and Japan grew significantly, but China remained Chile's most important trading partner in Asia. Chile's total trade with China reached U.S. $8.8 billion in 2006, representing nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

The growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales to the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. These three markets alone accounted for an additional US $5.5 billion worth of Chilean exports. Chilean exports to the United States totaled US $9.3 billion, representing a 37.7% increase compared to 2005 (US $6.7 billion). Exports to the European Union were US $15.4 billion, a 63.7% increased compared to 2005 (US $9.4 billion). Exports to Asia increased from US $15.2 billion in 2005 to US $19.7 billion in 2006, a 29.9% increase.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

During 2006, Chile imported US $26 billion from the Americas, representing 54% of total imports, followed by Asia at 22%, and Europe at 16%. Mercosur members were the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US $9.1 billion, followed by the United States with US $5.5 billion and the European Union with US $5.2 billion. From Asia, China was the most important exporter to Chile, with goods valued at US $3.6 billion. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a number of countries-Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and China (36.9%).<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Chile's overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world's largest copper-producing company, with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort to expand nontraditional exports. The most important non-mineral exports are forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and seafood, and [[Chilean wine|wine]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed [[free trade agreement]]s (FTA) with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement with Mercosur-Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay-went into effect in October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea. Chile, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008, Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile's trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008.<ref name="countrystudies"/>
[[File:Paseomu1.jpg|thumb|right|The port of [[San Antonio, Chile|San Antonio]]]]

After two years of negotiations, the United States and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003 that will lead to completely duty-free bilateral trade within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004, following approval by the U.S. and Chilean congresses. The bilateral FTA has inaugurated greatly expanded U.S.-Chilean trade ties, with total bilateral trade jumping by 154% during the FTA's first three years.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Chile unilaterally lowered its across-the-board import tariff for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement to 6% in 2003. Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands. The price bands were ruled inconsistent with Chile's [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) obligations in 2002, and the government has introduced legislation to modify them. Under the terms of the U.S.-Chile FTA, the price bands will be completely phased out for U.S. imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar within 12 years.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) and is active in the WTO's [[Doha Development Round|Doha round of negotiations]], principally through its membership in the [[G20 developing nations|G-20]] and [[Cairns Group]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Chile's financial sector has grown quickly in recent years, with a banking reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending legislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years, Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards. Chile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $70 billion at the end of 2006, has been an important source of investment capital for the capital market. However, by 2009, it has been reported that $21 billion had been lost from the pension system to the global financial crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090121/uncertain-future |title=An uncertain future |publisher=GlobalPost |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17}}</ref>

Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings (S&P A+) in Latin America.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Chile-OVERVIEW-OF-ECONOMY.html] Chile: Overview of economy</ref> There are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad: bank loans, issuance of bonds, and the selling of stocks on U.S. markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised through these means go to finance domestic Chilean investment. The government is required by law to run a fiscal surplus of at least 1% of GDP. In 2006, the Government of Chile ran a surplus of $11.3 billion, equal to almost 8% of GDP. The Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt only 3.9% of GDP at the end of 2006.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Chile's 2002 census reported a population of 15,116,435 people. Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, because of a declining [[birth rate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/estadisticas_vitales/pdf/anuarios/vitales2003.zip|title=Anuario Estadísticas Vitales 2003|publisher=Instituto National de Estadísticas}}</ref> By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/proyecciones/Informes/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20InforP_T.pdf|title=Chile: Proyecciones y Estimaciones de Población.

Ethnic structure
</heading>
<text>


Chile is a [[multiethnic society]], which means that it is home to people of many different ethnical backgrounds. As a result, the people there usually treat their nationality as a citizenship, but not an ethnicity.

One study conducted by Francisco Lizcano from [[UNAM]] suggested that people of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] origin made up 52.7% of the population and that Mestizos made up 44% of the population.<ref name="Lizcano">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LcabJ98-t1wC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=chile+60%25+blancos+Esteva-Fabregat|title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI|isbn=9789707570528|author1=Fernández, Francisco Lizcano|year=2007}}</ref> A study conducted by the [[University of Chile]] found that within the Chilean population, 30% are of European descent and Mestizos with [[Castizo|partly European]] ancestry are estimated to be 65% of the population.<ref name="UC">{{cite web| title=5.2.6.

The European portion of Chile's population consists mainly of people descended from [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] settlers (predominantly [[Castilian people|Castilian]], [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] and [[Basque people|Basque]]), with minorities having [[German Chilean|German]], [[Italian Chilean|Italian]], [[Irish Chilean|Irish]], [[French Chilean|French]], [[British Chilean|British]], [[Swiss Chilean|Swiss]], and [[Croatian Chilean|Croatian]] ancestry, singly or combined. The Mestizo segment, in this respect, would derive its European component from colonial Spanish settlers (mainly [[Andalusians]] and [[Castilian people|Castilians]]), while its Amerindian component would be from various tribes or groups, mainly Picunches and [[Mapuches]].

The [[Afro-Chilean]] population has always been tiny, reaching a high of 2,500 people during the colonial period; their current percentage of the population is less than one percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mazinger.sisib.uchile.cl/repositorio/lb/ciencias_quimicas_y_farmaceuticas/medinae/|title=Elementos de Salud Pública, section 5.2.6|publisher=University of Chile}}</ref> According to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population considered themselves indigenous.<ref name="medwave">{{cite web|url=http://www.medwave.cl/ciencia/11.act |title=El gradiente sociogenético chileno y sus implicaciones ético-sociales |publisher=Medwave.cl |date=2000-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>

European emigration to Chile (and to a lesser extent, the arrivals from the [[Middle East]]), during the second half of the 19th century and throughout the twentieth, was mostly to [[Latin America]] and then to areas like the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] of the Southern Cone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/olimpi98/fronterasculturales/datos/cap-pop.html |title=Juan Bialet Massé en su informe sobre "El estado de las clases obreras en el interior del país" |publisher=Oni.escuelas.edu.ar |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umng.edu.co/www/resources/idsocial.doc |title=SOCIAL IDENTITY Marta Fierro Social Psychologist. |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:xMNl1h24Z5oJ:www.eclac.org/publicaciones/xml/6/20606/lcg2230e_cap8.pdf+conosur+argentina+chile+y+uruguay+recibieron+inmigrantes+europeos&hl=es&gl=cl&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgPKhHPhWvASrcdlpdyAdXFt6Kh7N5j-HbzcmA8nSVHcnjm1oaGPUs1LqWeMWLJngvABPlFZm0Ho4ZnZzcuFldFPqnh_0NzjP8w6yt5n1Z5M1ff9y4bVv9pITvkAKRfF-VQFl0W&sig=AHIEtbQeK17QYlHRJLx1ktw1G1JkKR2eHA |title=Etnicidad y ciudadanía en América Latina |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>

Descendants of different [[ethnic groups in Europe|European ethnic groups]] often intermarried in Chile, diluting the cultures and separate identities of the home countries and fusing them together with the descendants of the original ''Basque-Castilian'' aristocracy of the [[colonial period]], while at the same time preserving some separate aspects.  This intermarriage and mixture of cultures and races has help shape the present society and culture of the Chilean middle and upper classes,<ref name="deia.com" /> who now enjoy varied elements of their original European cultures, such as [[British Chilean|British]] afternoon tea, [[German Chilean|German]] cakes, and [[Italian Chilean|Italian]] pasta.  The fusion is also visible in the architecture of Chilean cities.  These classes do, however, frequently deprecate Chilean folk culture, an offshoot of the culture of the [[Spaniards]] who settled the country in the colonial period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

{{Main|Chilean Spanish}}
The Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and "''s''" sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

The current Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4157908.stm|title=Chile scraps Pinochet-era system|publisher=BBC | date=2005-08-16 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>

Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on December 13, 2009. None of the four presidential candidates got more than 50% of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left [[Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia]] coalition's [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] and center-right [[Coalición por el Cambio]] coalition's [[Sebastián Piñera]], competed in a run-off election on January 17, 2010, which [[Sebastián Piñera]] won.  This was Chile's fifth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All five have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.

The [[Congress of Chile]] has a 38-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Senators serve for 8 years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The current Senate has a 20-18 split in favor of the opposition coalition. The last congressional elections were held on December 13, 2009, concurrently with the presidential election. The current lower house-the Chamber of Deputies-contains 58 members of the governing center-right coalition, 54 from the center-left opposition and 8 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valparaíso, about 140 kilometres (84&nbsp;mi) west of the capital, Santiago.

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that rewards the two largest representations. Therefore, there are only two senate and two deputy seats apportioned to each electoral district, parties are forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertación and Alianza) split most of the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats.

In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the [[Independent Democrat Union|UDI]] lost representation in favor of their respective allies [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. In the last legislative elections in Chile, the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communisty Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).

Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nation-wide overhaul of its criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view|work=Chilean Government|title=President Lagos: We can make a greater effort to make yesterday's and today's trials equally just}}</ref> The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.

Chile is divided into 15 regions, each headed by an [[intendant]] appointed by the president. The regions are further divided into provinces, with provincial governors also appointed by the president. Finally each province is divided into [[Communes of Chile|communes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/organigrama/organigrama.asp|title=Organigrama|work=Gobierno de Chile}}</ref> which are administered by municipalities, each with its own mayor and council elected for four year terms. Each region is designated by a name and a [[Roman numeral]], assigned from north to south. The only exception is the Santiago Metropolitan Region which is designated ''RM'' (''Región Metropolitana''). Two new regions were created in 2006 and became operative in October 2007; Los Ríos in the south (Region XIV), and Arica y Parinacota in the north (Region XV). The numbering scheme skipped Region [[Triskaidekaphobia|XIII]].

Gen. Ricardo Ortega Perrier heads 12,500 strong [[Chilean Air Force]]. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in Iquique, Antofagasta, Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas. The Air Force also operates an airbase on King George Island, Antarctica. The Air Force took delivery of the final 2 of 10 F-16s, all purchased from the U.S., in March 2007 after several decades of U.S. debate and previous refusal to sell.

Since the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–39) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the War of the Pacific (1879–83), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.<ref name="hudson"/>

During the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a country that had a decisive influence on the organization of the navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name="hudson"/>

On June 26, 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml#c|title=United Nations Member States}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/growth.shtml|title=United Nations Member States}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/av/photo/detail/0001314.html?browse=all.html|title=The San Francisco Conference: Chile Signs United Nations Charter}}</ref> With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.<ref name="hudson"/>

Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009.

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to reacquire territory it lost to Chile in 1879-83 War of the Pacific. The two countries maintain consular relations and are represented at the Consul General level.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

[[File:Fonasa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|FONASA, the funding branch of the Ministry of Health.]]
The Ministry of Health of Chile (Spanish: Ministerio de Salud de Chile), also known as MINSAL, is the cabinet-level administrative office in charge of planning, directing, coordinating, executing, controlling and informing the public health policies formulated by the President of Chile.

Fondo Nacional de Salud also known as FONASA is the funding branch of the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)]]. The National Health Fund (FONASA), created in 1979 by Decree Law No. 2763, is the financial entity entrusted to collect, manage and distribute state funds for health in Chile. It is funded by the public. Notably, all employees pay 7% of their monthly income to FONASA the funding branch of the Chilean Ministry of Health.

FONASA is part of the NHSS and has executive power through the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)]]. FONASA headquarters are in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and decentralized public service is conducted by various Regional Offices.

More than 12 million beneficiaries benefit from FONASA. Despite universal health care, beneficiaries can opt for more costly private insurance through ISAPRE. Political questions have been raised due to very wealthy beneficiaries opting for ISAPRE and thus generating health care inequity. Such is an example of socioeconomic disparity resulting in the high Gini coefficient in Chile.

During the period between early agricultural settlements and to the late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north. While southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Through the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily [[British people|English]], [[French people|French]], and [[German people|German]] began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], [[Frutillar]], [[Puerto Varas]], [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[Temuco]], [[Puerto Octay]], [[Llanquihue Province|Llanquihue]], [[Faja Maisan]], [[Pitrufquén]], [[Victoria, Chile|Victoria]], [[Pucón]] and [[Puerto Montt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsouthernchile.com/southamerica/valdivia-southern-chile-city-guide/index.html|title=Valdivia, Chile Living Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaladrenaline.com/latinamerica/chile/|title=Chile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnapec.org/index.cfm?action=exploration&cou_id=4|title=Chile}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/chile/foreign-relations.html|title=Foreign Relations}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Chile.html|title=Food in Chile}}</ref>

Music and dance
</heading>
<text>

Music in Chile ranges from folkloric music, popular music and also to classical music. Its large geography generates different musical expressions in the north, center and south of the country, including also Easter Island and Mapuche music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=elfolclordechileysustresgrandesraices |title=Memoria Chilena |publisher=Memoriachilena.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>  The national dance is the [[cueca]]. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody.

Between 1950 and 1970 appears a rebirth in folk music leading by groups such as [[Los de Ramon]], Los Cuatro Cuartos and Los Huasos Quincheros, among others <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicapopular.cl/2.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=444 |title=Conjuntos Folkloricos de Chile |publisher=Musicapopular.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> with composers such as [[Raul de Ramon]], [[Violeta Parra]] and others. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the [[Parra family]] with the [[Nueva Canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]], which was associated with political activists and reformers such as [[Victor Jara]] and [[Inti-Illimani]]. Other important [[folk music|folk]] singer and [[researcher]] on [[folklore]] and Chilean [[ethnography]], is [[Margot Loyola]]. Also many Chilean Rock bands like [[Los Jaivas]], [[Los Prisioneros]], [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]], and [[Los Tres]] have reached international success.

His three highly personalized homes, located in [[Isla Negra]], Santiago and Valparaíso are popular tourist destinations.

Among the list of other Chilean poets are [[Carlos Pezoa Véliz]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Gonzalo Rojas]], and [[Nicanor Parra]]. [[Isabel Allende]] is the best-selling Chilean novelist, with 51 millions of her novels sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=346023&CategoryId=13003 |title=Latin American Herald Tribune - Isabel Allende Named to Council of Cervantes Institute |publisher=Laht.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}</ref>  Novelist [[José Donoso|José Donoso's]] novel '[[The Obscene Bird of the Night]]' is considered by critic [[Harold Bloom]] to be one of the canonical works of 20th century Western literature.

[[Tourism]] in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6%, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly [[Argentina]]; followed by a growing number from the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Brazil]] with a growing number of Asians from [[South Korea]] and [[PR China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rides.cl/pdf/trade_tourism_chile.pdf|title=Unknown}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

The main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country: [[San Pedro de Atacama]], in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the [[Valle de la Luna (Chile)|Valley of the Moon]]. In [[Putre]], also in the North, there is the [[Chungará Lake]], as well as the [[Parinacota Volcano|Parinacota]] and the [[Pomerape]] volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute, like [[Portillo, Chile|Portillo]], [[Valle Nevado]] and [[Termas de Chillán]] . In the south, the main tourist sites are the coastal area around Tirúa and Cañete with the [[Isla Mocha]] and the [[Nahuelbuta National Park]], [[Chiloé Archipelago]] and [[Patagonia]], which includes [[Laguna San Rafael National Park]], with its many glaciers, and the [[Torres del Paine National Park]]. The central port city of [[Valparaíso]], with its unique architecture, is also popular. Finally, Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main Chilean tourist destinations.

For locals, tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer (December to March), and mainly in the coastal beach towns. [[Arica]], [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Coquimbo]] are the main summer centres in the north, and Pucón on the shores of [[Lake Villarrica]] is the main one in the south. Because of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valparaíso Region, with its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. [[Viña del Mar]], Valparaíso's northern affluent neighbor, is popular because of its beaches, [[casino]], and its annual [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|song festival]], the most important musical event in Latin America. The beaches of [[Pichilemu]], in the [[O'Higgins Region]], are recurrently visited by [[surf]]ers. Pichilemu is widely known as South America's "best surfing spot," according to [[Fodor's]].

In November 2005, the government launched a campaign under the brand "Chile: All Ways Surprising," intended to promote the country internationally for both business and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prochile.us/|title=Unknown|work=ProChile}}</ref>

[[File:Colca-condor-c03.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Andean Condor]] is the national bird of Chile]]
[[File:Lapageria rosea1.jpg|thumb|upright|A red [[copihue]], national flower of Chile]]
The national flower is the [[copihue]] (''Lapageria rosea'', Chilean [[bellflower]]), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.

The [[Coat of arms of Chile|coat of arms]] depicts the two national animals: the [[condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the [[Hippocamelus|huemul]] (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend ''Por la razón o la fuerza'' (''By Reason or by Force'').

The [[flag of Chile]] consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence. The flag of Chile is similar to the [[Flag of Texas]], although the Chilean flag is 21 years older. However, like the Texan flag, the flag of Chile is modeled after the [[Flag of the United States]].<ref>http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/samerica/chile.htm</ref>
