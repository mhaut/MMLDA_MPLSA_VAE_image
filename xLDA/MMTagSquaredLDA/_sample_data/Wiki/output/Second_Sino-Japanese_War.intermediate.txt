[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Allied Commander-in-Chief in the China theatre from 1942–1945.]]
In the Chinese language, the war is most commonly known as the War of Resistance Against Japan ({{zh
|t=抗日戰爭
|s=抗日战争}}), and also known as the Eight Years' War of Resistance(八年抗战/八年抗戰), simply War of Resistance (抗战/抗戰), or Second Sino-Japanese War (第二次中日战争/第二次中日戰爭).

</text>
<heading>
The Name
</heading>
<text>

In Japan, the name {{Nihongo|"Japan–China War"|日中戰爭|Nitchū Sensō}} is most commonly used because of its perceived objectivity. In Japan today, it is written as 日中戦争 in ''[[shinjitai]]''. When the invasion of China proper began in earnest in July 1937 near [[Beijing]], the [[Empire of Japan|government of Japan]] used {{Nihongo|"The North China Incident"|華北事變|Kahoku Jihen}}, and with the outbreak of the [[Battle of Shanghai]] the following month, it was changed to {{Nihongo|"The China Incident"|支那事變|[[Shina (word)|Shina]] Jihen}}.

The word {{Nihongo|"incident"|事變|jihen}} was used by Japan, as neither country had made a formal [[declaration of war]]. Japan wanted to avoid intervention by other countries, particularly the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], which were her primary source of petroleum; the United States was also her biggest supplier of [[steel]]. [[President of the United States|American President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] would have been forced to impose an [[embargo]] on Japan in observance of the American [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] had the fighting been formally escalated to "general war".

</text>
<heading>
Other Names
</heading>
<text>

In [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|Japanese propaganda]] however, the invasion of China became a "[[Religious war|holy war]]" (''seisen''), the first step of the {{Nihongo3|eight corners of the world under one roof|八紘一宇|Hakkō ichiu}}. In 1940, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] launched the [[Taisei Yokusankai]]. When both sides formally declared war in December 1941, the name was replaced by {{Nihongo|"[[Pacific War|Greater East Asia War]]"|大東亞戰爭|Daitōa Sensō}}.

Although the Japanese government still uses the term "China Incident" in formal documents, because the word ''[[Shina (word)|Shina]]'' is considered a derogatory word by China, the media in Japan often paraphrase with other expressions like {{Nihongo|"The Japan–China Incident"|日華事變|Nikka Jihen|日支事變 ''Nisshi Jihen''}}, which were used by media even in the 1930s.

In addition, the name "Second Sino-Japanese War" is not usually used in Japan, as the {{Nihongo|[[First Sino-Japanese War]]|日清戦争|Nisshin–Sensō}} between Japan and the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1894 is not regarded to have obvious direct linkage to the second, between Japan and the [[Republic of China]].

Background
</heading>
<text>


</text>
<heading>
[[First Sino-Japanese War]]
</heading>
<text>

The origin of the Second Sino-Japanese War can be traced to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–95, in which China, then under the [[Qing Dynasty]], was defeated by Japan and was forced to cede [[Taiwan]] to it, and to recognize the independence of Korea in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The Qing Dynasty was on the brink of collapse from internal revolts and foreign [[imperialism]], while Japan had emerged as a [[great power]] through its effective measures of [[modernization]].<ref>Wilson, Dick, When Tigers Fight: The story of the Sino-Japanese War, 1937–1945, p.5</ref>


</text>
<heading>
[[The Republic of China]]
</heading>
<text>

The [[Republic of China]] was founded in 1912, following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the Qing Dynasty. However, the nascent Republic was even weaker than its predecessor due to the predominance of Chinese [[Warlord era|warlord]]s. Unifying the nation and repelling imperialism seemed a very remote possibility.<ref>Wilson, Dick, p.4</ref> Some warlords even aligned themselves with various foreign powers in an effort to wipe each other out. For example, the warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] of [[Manchuria]] openly cooperated with the Japanese for military and economic assistance.<ref name="Foreign News: Revenge?-TIME-MAGAZINE">{{Cite news

In 1915, Japan issued the ''[[Twenty-One Demands]]'' to extort further political and commercial privilege from China.<ref>Hoyt, Edwin P., Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict, p.45</ref> Following [[World War I]], Japan acquired the [[German Empire]]'s [[sphere of influence]] in [[Shandong]]<ref>Palmer and Colton, A History of Modern World, p.725</ref> (Shantung), leading to nationwide anti-Japanese [[May Fourth Movement|protests and mass demonstrations]] in China, but China under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]] remained fragmented and unable to resist foreign incursions.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.33</ref> To unite China and eradicate regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] of 1926–28.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.57</ref>

[[Jinan Incident]]
</heading>
<text>

The Kuomintang's [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) swept through China until it was checked in Shandong, where Beiyang warlord [[Zhang Zongchang]], backed by the Japanese, attempted to stop the NRA's advance. This battle culminated in the [[Jinan Incident]] of 1928 in which the National Revolutionary Army and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] were engaged in a short conflict that resulted in Kuomintang's withdrawal from Jinan.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.79, p.82</ref>

</heading>
<text>

In the same year, Zhang Zuolin was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] when he became less willing to cooperate with Japan.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol.1, p.121</ref> Afterwards Zhang's son [[Zhang Xueliang]] quickly took over control of Manchuria, and despite strong Japanese lobbying efforts to continue the resistance against the KMT, he shortly [[Chinese reunification (1928)|declared his allegiance]] to the Kuomintang government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], which resulted in the nominal unification of China at the end of 1928.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.83</ref>

</text>
<heading>
[[Communist Party of China]]
</heading>
<text>

However in 1930, a large scale [[Central Plains War|civil war]] broke out between warlords who fought in alliance with Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition and central government under Chiang. In addition, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]]s (CCP, or Communist Party of China) revolted against the central government following a [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|purge of its members]] by the KMT in 1927. Therefore the Chinese central government diverted much attention into fighting these civil wars and followed a policy of "first internal pacification before external resistance"({{zh icon}}:{{lang|zh-Hant| 攘外必先安内}}).

The situation in China provided an easy opportunity for Japan to further its goals. Japan saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for her manufactured goods (now excluded from many Western countries by [[Great Depression|Depression]] era [[tariff]]s), and as a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]]. Japan [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] Manchuria outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] (九一八事變) in September 1931. After five months of fighting, the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] was established in 1932, with the last emperor of China, [[Puyi]], installed as a puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to directly challenge Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation was published as the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, and causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations entirely. [[Appeasement]] being the predominant policy of the day, no country was willing to take action against Japan beyond tepid censure.

Incessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought a short war in the [[January 28 Incident]]. This battle resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the anti-Japanese [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies|volunteer armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.

In 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region, the [[Tanggu Truce]] taking place in its aftermath, giving Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Rehe]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Here the Japanese aim was to create another buffer region, this time between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].

Japan increasingly used internal conflict in China to reduce the strength of her fractious opponents. This was precipitated by the fact that even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=華北特殊化|p=húaběitèshūhùa}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan Province|Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].

This Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei.  In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He–Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei.  In the same year, the [[Chin–Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei–Chahar Political Council]] were established.  There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] (蒙古軍政府) was formed on May 12, 1936, Japan providing all necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].

[[File:Casualties of a mass panic - Chungking, China.jpg|thumb|right|Casualties of a mass panic during a June 1941 Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]]. More than 5000 civilians died during the first two days of air raids in 1939<ref>Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, 2001, p.364</ref>]]

Most historians place the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War on July 7, 1937 at the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], when a crucial access point to [[Beijing]] was assaulted by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA). Because the Chinese defenders were the poorly equipped infantry divisions of the former [[Guominjun|Northwest Army]], the Japanese easily [[Battle of Beiping–Tianjin|captured Beiping and Tianjin]].

The [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo were initially reluctant to escalate the conflict into full scale war, being content with the victories achieved in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. However, the KMT central government determined that the "breaking point" of Japanese aggression had been reached and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)|air force]] under his direct command to attack the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marines]] in Shanghai on August 13, 1937, which led to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].  The IJA had to mobilize over 200,000 troops, coupled with numerous naval vessels and aircraft to capture Shanghai after more than three months of intense fighting, with casualties far exceeding initial expectations.<ref>Fu Jing-hui, An Introduction of Chinese and Foreign History of War, 2003, p.109–111</ref>

Building on the hard won victory in Shanghai, the IJA captured the KMT capital city of [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) and [[Battle of Xinkou|Southern Shanxi]] by the end of 1937, in campaigns involving approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese.  Historians estimate up to 300,000 Chinese were [[mass murder]]ed in the [[Nanking Massacre]] (also known as the "Rape of Nanking"), after the [[Battle of Nanking|fall of Nanking]] on December 13, 1937, while some Japanese [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Japanese war crimes|deny]] the existence of a massacre.

At the start of 1938, the Headquarters in Tokyo still hoped to limit the scope of the conflict to occupying areas around Shanghai, Nanjing and most of northern China. They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the [[Soviet Union]], but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war]] and finally met with defeat at [[Battle of Taierzhuang|Taierzhuang]]. Afterwards the IJA had to change its strategy and deploy almost all of its armies in the attack on the city of [[Wuhan]], which by now was the political, economic and military center of China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) and forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.<ref>Ray Huang, Chiang Kai-shek Diary from a Macro History Perspective, 1994, p.168</ref> But after the Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|capture of the city of Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, the KMT was forced to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) to set up a provisional capital, with Chiang Kai-shek still refusing to negotiate unless Japan agreed to withdraw to her pre-1937 borders.

With Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters decided to retaliate by ordering the air force of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|navy]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets in the [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and nearly every major city in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured and homeless.

From the beginning of 1939 the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]].  These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch its first large-scale [[1939–1940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940. However, due to her low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], the NRA was defeated in this offensive. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly-trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped men in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.

From 1940 on the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve its occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly [[Puppet state|puppet governments]] favourable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered, the most prominent being the [[Nanjing Nationalist Government]] headed by former KMT premier [[Wang Jingwei]]. However, the [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Japanese army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left them very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was the ability to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.

By 1941 Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and [[Vietnam]], but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas. Japan had suffered tremendous casualties from unexpectedly stubborn Chinese resistance, and neither side could make any swift progress in a manner resembling the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] and Western Europe to [[Nazi Germany]].

and a resolution adopted by the [[League of Nations]] on May 14, 1938, condemning the use of poison gas by the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] frequently used chemical weapons during the war.
[[File:IJA chemical warfare3.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Japanese troops stage a poison gas attack in China.]]
According to historians [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] and Seiya Matsuno, the chemical weapons were authorized by specific orders given by [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] himself, transmitted by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]]. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the [[Battle of Wuhan]] from August to October 1938.<ref>Y. Yoshimi and S. Matsuno, ''Dokugasusen Kankei Shiryō II (Materials on poison gas warfare), Kaisetsu, Hōkan 2, Jugonen Sensō Gokuhi Shiryōshu'', 1997, p.27–29</ref> They were also used during the [[Battle of Changde|invasion of Changde]]. Those orders were transmitted either by [[Prince Kan'in Kotohito]] or General [[Hajime Sugiyama]].<ref>Yoshimi and Matsuno, ''idem'', [[Herbert P. Bix|Herbert Bix]], Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2001, p.360–364</ref>

[[Biological warfare|Bacteriological weapon]]s provided by [[Shirō Ishii]]'s [[Unit 731|units]] were also profusely used. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed [[Ningbo]] with [[flea]]s carrying the [[bubonic plague]].<ref>''Japan triggered bubonic plague outbreak, doctor claims'', [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html], http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/wwii.html, A time-line of World War II, Scaruffi Piero. Prince [[Tsuneyoshi Takeda]] and [[Prince Mikasa]] received a special screening by [[Shirō Ishii]] of a film showing imperial planes loading germ bombs for bubonic dissemination over Ningbo in 1940. (Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p.32.) All these weapons were experimented with on humans before being used in the field.</ref> During the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped [[Plague (disease)|plague]]-contaminated fleas on [[Changde]]. These attacks caused epidemic plague outbreaks.<ref>Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, pages 220–221.</ref>

Their attempt to get the Muslim [[Hui people]] on their side failed, as many Chinese NRA Generals such as [[Bai Chongxi]], [[Ma Hongbin]], [[Ma Hongkui]], and [[Ma Bufang]] were Hui and fought against the Japanese army.

Even before the war began, the Chinese Muslim General [[Ma Zhanshan]] was fighting and severely mauling the Japanese army in Manchuria before 1937. The Japanese officer [[Doihara Kenji]] approached him in an attempt to make him defect. He pretended to defect to the Japanese, then used the money they gave him to rebuild his army and fought them again, leading a guerilla campaign in [[Suiyuan]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=riDT0BxwpMAC&pg=PA307&dq=battle+of+suiyuan+ma&hl=en&ei=sF6VTOKrD4O0lQf067GoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20suiyuan%20ma&f=false|title=Inside Asia – 1942 War Edition|author=John Gunther|year=2007|publisher=READ BOOKS|location=|isbn=1406715328|page=307|page=668|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

The Japanese planned to invade [[Ningxia]] from Suiyuan in 1939 and create a Hui puppet state. The next year in 1940, the Japanese were defeated militarily by the Kuomintang Muslim General [[Ma Hongbin]], who caused the plan to collapse.

A Chinese Muslim Imam, [[Hu Songshan]], was instrumental in his support of the war. When Japan invaded China in 1937, Hu Songshan ordered that the [[Flag of the Republic of China|Chinese Flag]] be saluted during morning prayer, along with an exhortation to nationalism. He invoked Quranic authority to urge sacrifice against Japan. A prayer was written by him in [[Arabic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] which prayed to Allah for the defeat of the Japanese and support of the Kuomintang Chinese government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=ma+fuxiang+our+party&source=bl&ots=gMwLItF3rt&sig=Y4eKstUC_TGgOelKv60xxJb-J2I&hl=en&ei=968WTL_0DYKBlAecxOCjDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Oh%20God!%20Help%20our%20government%20and%20nation&f=false|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=200|isbn=9050295976446|page=266|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

Hu Songshan also ordered that all Imams in Ningxia preach Chinese nationalism. The Muslim General [[Ma Hongkui]] assisted him in this order, making nationalism required at every mosque. Hu Songshan led the [[Yihewani|Ikhwan]], the Chinese Muslim Brotherhood, which became a Chinese nationalist, patriotic organization, stressing education and independence of the individual.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lSxYAAAAMAAJ&q=hu+songshan&dq=hu+songshan&hl=en&ei=96sbTOKQHoOBlAe5wsWsCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA|title=Papers from the Conference on Chinese Local Elites and Patterns of Dominance, Banff, August 20–24, 1987, Volume 3|author=|year=1987|publisher=|location=|page=30|isbn=|page=254|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NyhtAAAAMAAJ&q=hu+songshan&dq=hu+songshan&hl=en&ei=96sbTOKQHoOBlAe5wsWsCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ|title=Devout societies vs. impious states?: transmitting Islamic learning in Russia, Central Asia and China, through the twentieth century : proceedings of an international colloquium held in the Carré des Sciences, French Ministry of Research, Paris, November 12–13, 2001|author=Stéphane A.

The Chinese Islamic Association issued "A message to all Muslims in China from the Chinese Islamic Association for National Salvation" in Ramadan of 1940 during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

<blockquote>
"We have to implement the teaching "the love of the fatherland is an article of faith" by the Prophet Muhammad and to inherit the Hui's glorious history in China. In addition, let us reinforce our unity and participate in the twice more difficult taks of supporting a defensive war and promoting religion.... We hope that ahongs and the elite will initiate a movement of prayer during Ramadan and implement group prayer to support our intimate feeling toward Islam. A sincere unity of Muslims should be developed to contribute power towards the expulsion of Japan."
</blockquote>

Ahong is the Chinese word for Imam. During the war against Japan, the Imams supported Muslim reisistance in battle, calling for Muslims to participate in the Jihad against Japan, and becoming a [[shaheed]] (islamic term for martyr).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&dq=ma+fuxiang+defence&q=jihad+japan#v=snippet&q=expulsion%20of%20japan&f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication|author=Stéphane A.

[[Ma Bufang]] sent the Muslim Brigade commander [[Major General]] Ma Buluan (马步銮),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generals.dk/general/Ma_Buluan/_/China.html |title=Ma Buluan |publisher=Generals.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> who led the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, which was originally known as the nationalist 1st Cavalry Division and was later renamed as the 8th Cavalry Division during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The brigade was stationed in eastern [[Henan]], and fought a number of battles against the Japanese invaders who grew to fear the nationalist cavalry unit, calling it “Ma’s Islamic Division”.

The Qinghai Chinese, Salar, Chinese Muslim, Dongxiang, and Tibetan troops Ma Bufang sent fought to the death against the Imperial Japanese Army, or committed suicide refusing to be taken prisoner, instead, they committed suicide when cornered by the enemy. When they defeated the Japanese, the Muslim troops slaughtered all of them except for a few prisoners to send back to Qinghai prove that they were victorious. In September 1940, when the Japanese made an offensive against the Muslim Qinghai troops, the Muslims ambushed them and killed so many of them they were forced to retreat. The Japanese could not even pick up their dead, they instead cut an arm from their corpses limbs for cremation to send back to Japan. The Japanese did not dare make an offensive like that again.<ref>{{cite news |title=马家军悲壮的抗战：百名骑兵集体投河殉国(1)|author=|newspaper=军事－中华网|date=19 September 2008|url=http://military.china.com/zh_cn/dljl/krzz/01/11044207/20080919/15096066.html}}</ref>

After [[World War II]], the unit returned to [[Qinghai]] from [[Xuzhou]] and was subsequently reorganized as the 1st Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division.

Chinese resistance strategy

[[Image:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in [[Battle of Taierzhuang]].]]
The basis of Chinese strategy before the entrance of Western Allies can be divided into two periods:

'''First Period''': 7 July 1937 ([[Marco Polo Bridge Incident|Battle of Lugou Bridge]])&nbsp;– 25 October 1938 ([[Battle of Wuhan|Fall of Wuhan]]).

Unlike Japan, China was unprepared for [[total war]] and had little military-industrial strength, no [[Armoured warfare|mechanized divisions]], and few [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armored forces]]. Up until the mid-1930s China had hoped that the [[League of Nations]] would provide countermeasures to Japan's aggression. In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: "''the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart''". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CCP was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.

Even under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the [[United States]] and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. A fast retreat would discourage foreign aid so Chiang decided to make a stand in the [[Battle of Shanghai]]. Chiang sent the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing.  While this was a military defeat for the Chinese, it proved that China would not be defeated easily and showed China's determination to the world, which became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people as it ended the Japanese taunt that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.

Afterwards the Chinese began to adopt the strategy of "trading space for time" ({{zh icon}}: {{lang|zh-Hant|以空間換取時間}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, to allow the [[home front]], along with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, where [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]], the consecutive Japanese advancements and conquests began to stall in late 1938.

'''Second Period''': 25 October 1938 (Fall of Wuhan) – December 1941 (before the Allies' [[declaration of war]] on Japan).
[[Image:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|left|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]

During this period, the Chinese main objective was to prolong the war as long as possible, exhausting the Japanese resources and building up the Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy "winning by outlasting".  Therefore, the National Revolutionary Army adopted the concept of "magnetic warfare" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attack]]s, and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic is the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]] while inflicting heavy casualties on the IJA.

Also, local Chinese resistance forces, organised by the Chinese communists and KMT continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast lands of China difficult. In 1940 the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroyed railways and blew up a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Japanese army and led them to employ the "[[Three Alls Policy]]" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|mul-Hani|三光政策}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''Sānguāng Zhèngcè'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sankō Seisaku''). It was during this time period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.

By 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had successfully retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. Furthermore, in the occupied areas Japanese control was limited to just railroads and major cities ("points and lines"), but they did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, which was a hotbed of Chinese partisan activities. This stalemate situation made a decisive victory seem impossible to the Japanese.

Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists
</heading>
<text>

After the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion strongly criticized the leader of Manchuria, the "young marshal" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was indirectly responsible for this policy.  Afterwards Chiang Kai-shek assigned Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] the duty of suppressing the [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]].  This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, and Chiang Kai-shek did not give him any support in manpower and weaponry.

[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander Zhu De with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap.]]

On 12 December 1936 a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang decided to conspire with the CCP and [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]] to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CCP.  To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT was forced to agree to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the forming of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CCP and KMT against Japan on 24 December 1936.  The cooperation took place with salutary effects for the beleaguered CCP, and they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] which were nominally under the command of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]. The Red Army of CCP fought in alliance with the KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].

However, despite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938 as a result of the Communists efforts to aggressively expand their military strength through absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind enemy lines. For Chinese militia who refuse to switch their allegiance, the CCP would call them "collaborators" and then attack to eliminate their forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June, 1939.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.259</ref>  Starting in 1940, open conflicts between the Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.

Afterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CCP's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CCP power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CCP doctrine that came to be formalized as "[[Mao Zedong Thought]]". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CCP and fighting the Japanese at the same time<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news

At the outbreak of full scale war, many global powers were reluctant to provide support to China; because in their opinion the Chinese would eventually lose the war, and they did not wish to antagonize the Japanese who might, in turn, eye their colonial possessions in the region. They expected any support given to the Chinese might worsen their own relationship with the Japanese, who taunted the Chinese with the prospect of conquest within three months. However, [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] did provide support to the Chinese before the war escalated to the Asian theatre of [[World War II]], with the [[United States]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] lending support to China afterwards.

Prior to the outbreak of the war, Germany and China had close economic and military cooperation, with Germany helping China modernize its industry and military in exchange for raw materials. More than half of the German arms exports during its rearmament period were to China. Nevertheless the proposed 30 [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|new divisions]] equipped and trained with German assistance did not materialize when Germany withdrew its support in 1938, because [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to form an alliance with Japan against the Soviet Union.

With the signing of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] between Germany and Japan, the Soviet Union wished to keep China in the war to hinder the Japanese from invading [[Siberia]], thus saving itself from the threat of a [[two-front war]]. In September 1937, the Soviet leadership signed the [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]], began aiding China, and approved [[Operation Zet]], a [[Soviet Volunteer Group|Soviet volunteer air force]]. As part of the secret operation, Soviet technicians upgraded and handled some of the Chinese war-supply transport. [[Bomber]]s, [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], military supplies and advisors arrived, including Soviet general [[Vasily Chuikov]], later to become victor at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Prior to the entrance of Western allies, the Soviet Union provided the largest amount of foreign aid to China, totalling some $250 million of credits in munitions and supplies. In 1941, Soviet aid ended as a result of the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] and the beginning of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. This pact enabled the Soviet Union to avoid fighting against Germany and Japan at the same time. 3,665 Soviet advisors and pilots fought for the Chinese side<ref>Taylor, Jay, The Generalissimo, p.156.</ref> In total, 227 Soviets died fighting for China.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter4_4.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

From December 1937 events such as the [[Panay incident|Japanese attack on the USS ''Panay'']] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion, which prompted the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and [[French Third Republic|France]] to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to the [[Republic of China]]. Furthermore, [[Australia]] prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned [[iron ore]] exports in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/3~221 |title=Memorandum by Mr J.

In mid-1941, the United States government financed the creation of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG), or [[Flying Tigers]], to replace the withdrawal of Soviet volunteers and aircraft. Led by [[Claire Lee Chennault]], their early combat success of 300 kills against a loss of 12 of their shark painted [[Curtiss P-40|P-40]] fighters earned them wide recognition at the time when Allies were suffering heavy losses, and soon afterwards their dogfighting tactics would be adopted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. Furthermore, to pressure the Japanese to end all hostilities in China, the United States, Britain, and the [[Dutch East Indies]] began oil and/or steel [[embargo]]s against Japan. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China. This set the stage for Japan to launch a series of military attacks against the Allies when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] raided [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.

Within a few days of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], China formally [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against Japan, Germany and Italy,<ref name="China Declares War">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> and right afterwards the [[National Revolutionary Army]] achieved another [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|decisive victory]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) in [[Changsha]], which earned the Chinese government much prestige from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. [[President of the United States|American President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] referred to the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union and China as the world's "[[Four Policemen]]", elevating the international status of China to an unprecedented height after a century of humiliation at the hands of various imperialist powers.

[[Chiang Kai-shek]] continued to receive supplies from the United States as the Chinese conflict was merged into the [[Pacific War|Asian theatre of World War II]]. However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union that stayed open most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan–Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over "[[The Hump]]".

Most of China's own industry had already been captured or destroyed by Japan, and the Soviet Union refused to allow the United States to supply China through [[Kazakhstan]] into [[Xinjiang]] because the Xinjiang warlord [[Sheng Shicai]] turned [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] in 1942 with Chiang's approval. For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount any major counter-offensive. Despite the severe shortage of [[materiel]], in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives in [[Battle of West Hubei|Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].

Chiang was appointed Allied [[commander-in-chief]] in the China theater in 1942, while American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's [[chief of staff]], and at the same time commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]]. However, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down for many reasons. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government.

However, other historians (such as [[Ray Huang]]) found that it was a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops, which Chiang vehemently opposed. Stilwell also did not appreciate the complexity of the situation, including the buildup of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] during the war (essentially Chiang had to fight a multi-front war—the Japanese on one side, the Communists on the other). Stilwell openly criticized the Chinese government's conduct of the war in the American media, and to American President Roosevelt.

Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite pleads from the other Allies to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate to America's overwhelming industrial output. Due to these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.

Conflicts among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom also emerged in the Pacific War. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, the majority of whom were defeated by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to reopen the [[Burma Road]]. On the other hand, Stilwell believed that the reopening of the Burma Road was vital to China as all the ports on mainland China were under Japanese control. Churchill's "[[Europe first|Europe First]]" policy obviously did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send in more and more troops into [[Indochina]] in the [[Burma Campaign]] was suspected by Chiang as an attempt by Britain to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings and prevent the gate to India from falling to Japan.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.300</ref>

Chiang also believed that China should divert their crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers and defeat the IJA through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] in a meeting with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1942, which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.299</ref>

The United States saw the Chinese theater as a means to tie up a large number of Japanese troops, as well as being a location for American airbases from which to strike the Japanese home islands. In 1944, as the Japanese position in the Pacific was deteriorating fast, the IJA mobilized over 400,000 men and launched their [[Operation Ichi-Go|largest offensive]] in World War II to attack the American airbases in China and link up the railway between [[Manchuria]] and [[Vietnam]]. This brought major cities in [[Hunan]], [[Henan]] and [[Guangxi]] under Japanese occupation. The failure of the Chinese forces to defend these areas encouraged Stilwell to attempt to gain command of the entire Chinese army, and his subsequent showdown with Chiang led to his replacement by [[Major General]] [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]].

However, by the end of 1944 [[Chinese Army in India|Chinese troops]] under the command of [[Sun Li-jen]] attacking from India and those under the command of [[Wei Lihuang]] attacking from [[Yunnan]] joined forces in [[Mong-Yu]], which succeeded in driving out the Japanese in North Burma and securing the [[Ledo Road]], a vital supply route to China.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.420</ref> In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives and retook [[Battle of West Hunan|Hunan]] and [[Second Guangxi Campaign|Guangxi]]. With the Chinese army progressing well in training and equipment, Wedemeyer planned to launch Operation Carbonado in summer 1945 to retake [[Guangdong]], thus obtaining a coastal port, and from there drive northwards toward [[Shanghai]]. However, the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] hastened Japanese surrender and these plans were not put into action.

The Soviet Union attacked the Republic of China in 1937 during the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]. The Muslim General Ma Hushan of the Kuomintang [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] resisted the Soviet Invasion, which was being led by Russian troops commanded by Muslim General [[Ma Zhanshan]], previously one of Chiang Kaishek's suboordinates.

General Ma Hushan was expecting some sort of help from Nanjing, as he exchanged messages with Chiang regarding Soviet attack. Both the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Xinjiang war erupting at the same time left Chiang and Ma Hushan on their own to face the Japanese and Soviet enemies.

The Republic of China government was fully aware of the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang province, and Soviet troops moving around Xinjiang and Gansu, but was forced to mask these manoeuvers to the public as "Japanese propaganda" to avoid an international incident and for continued military supplies from the Soviets.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&dq=ma+hongkui+japanese+abolish+prince&q=soviet+border+japanese+proganda#v=onepage&q=soviet%20border%20japanese%20propaganda&f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=|isbn=0415582644|page=58|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

The [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai]] was being waged by the Kuomintang Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] against Tibetan rebels, and several border crisis with Tibet erupted that required troops.

Since the Pro Soviet governor [[Sheng Shicai]] controlled [[Xinjiang]], which was garrisoned with Soviet troops in [[Turfan]], which bordered [[Gansu]], the Chinese government had to keep troops stationed there as well.

The Muslim General [[Ma Buqing]] was in virtual control of the [[Gansu]] corridor at this time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=DEZKTPtzgfvwBramnT8&ct=result&id=y3oeAAAAMAAJ&dq=salar+army++Ma+pu-fang&q=Ma+pu-fang|title=Asia, Volume 40|author=|year=1940|publisher=Asia Magazine|location=|page=|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but since the Soviet threat was great, Chiang made some arrangements regarding Ma's position.

After Ma evacuated his positions in Gansu, Kuomintang troops from central China flooded the area, and inflitrated Soviet occupied Xinjiang, gradually reclaiming it and forcing Sheng Shicai to break with the Soviets. The Kuomintang ordered Ma Bufang several times to march his troops into Xinjiang to intimidate the pro Soviet Governor[Sheng Shicai.

{{Main|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)|Japanese Instrument of Surrender}}

On August 6, an [[United States|American]] [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bomber dropped the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] used in combat on [[Hiroshima]]. On August 9, the [[Soviet Union]] renounced its [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Japan and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)|attacked the Japanese in Manchuria]], fulfilling its [[Yalta Conference]] pledge to attack the Japanese within three months after the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]]. The attack was made by three Soviet army groups.

In less than two weeks the [[Kwantung Army]], which was the primary Japanese fighting force,<ref>http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/glantz3/glantz3.asp</ref><ref>Robert A. Pape. Why Japan Surrendered. ''International Security'', Vol. 18, No. 2 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 154–201</ref> consisting of over a million men but lacking in adequate armor, artillery, or air support had been destroyed by the Soviets. On August 9, a second atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on [[Nagasaki]]. [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] officially [[Surrender of Japan|capitulated]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on August 15, 1945, and the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|official surrender]] was signed aboard the battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] on September 2.

After the Allied victory in the Pacific, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered all Japanese forces within China (excluding [[Manchuria]]), [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and [[French Indochina]] north of 16° north latitude to surrender to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Japanese troops in China formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.

{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}

[[File:Japanese Instrument of Surrender September 1945.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[China Expeditionary Army]] [[Yasuji Okamura]] presenting the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] to general [[He Yingqin]] at [[Nanjing]] on 9 September 1945.]]

In 1945 [[Republic of China|China]] emerged from the war nominally a great military power but economically weak and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling [[inflation]], and by corruption in the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] government that included [[War profiteering|profiteering]], [[speculation]] and [[hoarding]].

Furthermore, as part of the [[Yalta Conference]], allowing a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sphere of influence]] in [[Manchuria]], the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was [[Famine|starvation]] in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.

The problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At [[Yan'an]] and elsewhere in the liberated areas, [[Mao Zedong]] was able to adapt [[Marxism–Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.

The [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting [[guerrilla warfare]] in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organizational and [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda]], the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.

[[Image:Liuchow 1945.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Chinese return to [[Liuzhou]] in July 1945.]]

Mao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria.  This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)|Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in the belief that the Soviet Union would deal only with the Nationalist government after the war.

However, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Japanese army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. The [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out between the Nationalists and Communists following that, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.

{{Main|Legal status of Taiwan}}
[[Taiwan]] and the [[Penghu]] islands were put under the administrative control of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].<ref name="unhcr.org">[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Taiwan : Overview] UNHCR</ref> The ROC proclaimed Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25, 1945. However, due to the unresolved [[Chinese Civil War]], neither the newly established [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in [[mainland China]] nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement.<ref>name="aao.sinica.edu.tw" [http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_e/Year2007/human12.pdf] Disputes over Taiwanese Sovereignty and the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty Since World War II</ref> Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.

In 1952, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was signed separately between the ROC and Japan that basically followed the same guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the [[Taiwanese people]] and the juridicial person should be the people and the juridicial person of the ROC.<ref name="unhcr.org"/> Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] which specifically accepted the [[Potsdam Declaration]] which refers to the [[Cairo Declaration]]. Disputes over the precise ''de jure'' sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a ''de facto'' basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been and continues to be exercised by the ROC. Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.<ref>[http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=453676] FOCUS: Taiwan–Japan ties back on shaky ground as Taipei snubs Tokyo envoy</ref>

The question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.

In the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP or CPC), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/photo/2005-09/03/content_3439239.htm |title=抗战胜利大事记:共产党抗日武装战史[组图&#93; |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CCP has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CCP engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to "acknowledge" the Nationalists and the Communists as "equal" contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name="China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender—New York Times">{{Cite news

Other scholars document quite a different view. Such studies find evidence that the Communists actually played a minuscule role in the war against the Japanese compared to the Nationalists, and preserved their strength for a final showdown with the Kuomintang (KMT).<ref>Chang and Ming, July 12, 2005, pg. 8; and Chang and Halliday, pg.&nbsp;233, 246, 286–287</ref> This view point gives the KMT credit for the brunt of the fighting, which is confirmed by Communists leader [[Zhou Enlai]]'s secret report to [[Joseph Stalin]] in January 1940. This report stated that out of more than one million Chinese soldiers killed or wounded since the war began in 1937, only 40,000 were from the Communists [[Eighth Route Army]] and [[New Fourth Army]]. In other words, by the CCP's own account, the Communists had suffered a mere three percent of total casualties half way into the war.<ref>Dallin and Firsov, Dimitrov and Stalin, pp.115, 120</ref>

This is because the Communists were not the main participants in any of the 22 major battles between China and Japan (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) and usually avoided open warfare (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions), preferring to fight in small squads to harass the Japanese supply lines. In comparison, right from the beginning of the war the Nationalists committed their best troops (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] from the Japanese, and continue to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese and declared that the CCP should "save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, "The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32–36</ref> The Japanese considered the KMT rather than the Communists as their main enemy<ref>Chang and Halliday, pg. 231</ref> and [[Bombing of Chongqing|bombed the Nationalist wartime capital]] of Chongqing to the point that it was the most heavily bombed city in the world to date.<ref>Chang and Halliday, pg. 232</ref>

To this day the war is a major point of contention between China and Japan. The war remains a major roadblock for [[People's Republic of China&nbsp;– Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]], and many people, particularly in China, harbour grudges over the war and related issues.

The Japanese invasion of its neighbours is often glorified or whitewashed, and wartime atrocities, most notably the [[Nanking Massacre]], [[comfort women]], [[Unit 731]], and a variety of other war crimes attributed to Japan are frequently denied by Japanese nationalists and/or right-wingers. The Japanese government has also been accused of [[historical revisionism]] by allowing the approval of [[Japanese textbook controversy|school textbooks]] omitting or glossing over Japan's militant past. In response to criticism of Japanese textbook revisionism, the PRC government has been accused of using the war to stir up already growing [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s to whip up [[Chinese nationalism|nationalistic feelings]].

On 30 September 1931, two weeks after the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) invaded [[Manchuria]], the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] issued this manifesto:

{{cquote| Only Chinese Communist Party, who is the absolute leader of all the workers, peasants, students of China, to attack the KMT.This incident, in which Japan had invaded Manchuria, would not slow down the Chinese Communist Party's attack towards the KMT regime. On the contrary, Chinese Communist Party would double it's effort and work harder to overthrow this KMT regime, which is the tool of foreign imperialism in China.<ref>[[s:zh:中国共产党为日帝国主义强占东三省第二次宣言]]</ref>}}

In 1972, when the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and [[Japan]] established formal diplomatic relationship, [[Mao Zedong]] met the then [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. When Tanaka personally apologized to Mao for invading China, Mao responded: {{cquote|(You) don't have to say sorry, your country had made a great contribution to China. Why? Because if Imperial Japan did not start the war, how could we communists become mighty and powerful? How could we overthrow KMT? How could we defeat Chiang Kai-shek?  No, we are grateful and do not want your war reparations!

While the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) government has been accused of greatly exaggerating the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP or CPC)'s role in fighting the Japanese in [[mainland China]], the aftermath of the war is more complicated in [[Taiwan]].

Traditionally, the [[Republic of China]] government has held celebrations marking the [[Victory Day]] on September 9 (now known as [[Armed Forces Day]]) and Taiwan's [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25. However, with the power transfer from [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) to the pro-[[Taiwan independence]] [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) in 2000 and the rise of [[desinicization]], events commemorating the war have become less commonplace. Many supporters of [[Taiwanese independence]] see no relevance in preserving the memory of the war of resistance that happened primarily on [[mainland China]]. Some 120,000 Taiwanese even [[Ethnic Taiwanese Imperial Japan Serviceman|volunteered for or were drafted]] into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

On the other hand, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Since the KMT won the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.

A total of 396,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers. Another 54,000 soldiers also died after the war had ended, mostly from illness and starvation.<ref name="Coox pp. 308">ed. Coox, Alvin and Hilary Conroy "China and Japan: A Search for Balance since World War I", pp. 308.</ref> Of the 1,740,955 Japanese soldiers who died during World War II, 22 percent died in China.<ref>ed. Dower, John "War Without Mercy", pp. 297.</ref> Current Japanese statistics, however, lack complete estimates for the wounded. From 1937–1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937–1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940. Chinese forces also report that by May 1945, 22,293 Japanese soldiers were captured as prisoners. Many more Japanese soldiers surrendered when the war ended.<ref name="Coox pp. 308"/><ref>Dower, John "War Without Mercy", pp. 297</ref>

Communist Chinese sources report that their forces were responsible for the deaths of 1,704,117 Japanese soldiers. Such a figure, which almost equate total Japanese deaths in all of World War II, was ridiculed by Nationalist authorities as propaganda since the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] was outnumbered by the Japanese Army by approximately 3 to 1. Nationalist War Minister [[He Yingqin]] himself contested the claim, finding it impossible for a force of "untrained, undisciplined, poorly equipped" guerrillas to have killed so many enemy soldiers.<ref>ed. Coox, Alvin and Hilary Conroy "China and Japan: A Search for Balance since World War I", pp. 296.</ref>

Nationalist Chinese authorities report Japanese casualties at 1.77 million deaths, 1.9 million wounded.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The National Chinese authorities ridiculed Japanese estimates of Chinese casualties. In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true amount of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower. The article reports on the casualty situation of the war up to 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=riuRTN_fKcT6lwfU3tXjAQ&ct=result&id=6Rknr9XSMggC&dq=was+ridiculed+by+Nationalist+authorities+as+japanese&q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald|title=China monthly review, Volume 95|author=|year=1940|publisher=Millard Publishing Co.|page=187|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks%3A1&q=The+Japanese+attempt++on+the+part+of+china+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+Herald&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=c295382bce16bc53 |title=google search of the source |publisher=Google.com |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks%3A1&q=The+Japanese+attempt++on+the+part+of+china+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+Herald+cheat+the+japanese+people&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=c295382bce16bc53 |title=(source continued) |publisher=Google.com |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>

[[File:Republic of China Army Flag.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[National Revolutionary Army]].]]

The National Revolutionary Army (NRA) throughout its lifespan employed approximately 4,300,000 regulars, in 370 [[Division (military)|Standard Divisions]] ({{zh|t=正式師}}), 46 New Divisions ({{zh|t=新編師}}), 12 [[Cavalry|Cavalry Divisions]] ({{zh|t=騎兵師}}), eight New Cavalry Divisions ({{zh|t=新編騎兵師}}), 66 Temporary Divisions ({{zh|t=暫編師}}), and 13 [[Military reserve force|Reserve Divisions]] ({{zh|t=預備師}}), for a grand total of 515 divisions.

However, many divisions were formed from two or more other divisions, and many were not active at the same time. The number of active divisions, at the start of the war in 1937, was about 170 NRA divisions. The average NRA division had 4,000–5,000 troops. A Chinese army was roughly the equivalent to a Japanese division in terms of manpower but the Chinese forces largely lacked artillery, heavy weapons, and motorized transport.

The shortage of military hardware meant that three to four Chinese armies had the firepower of only one Japanese division. Because of these material constraints, available artillery and heavy weapons were usually assigned to specialist brigades rather than to the general division, which caused more problems as the Chinese command structure lacked precise coordination. The relative fighting strength of a Chinese division was even weaker when relative capacity in aspects of warfare, such as [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[logistics]], [[Military communications|communications]], and medical services, are taken into account.

The National Revolutionary Army can be divided roughly into two groups. The first one is the so-called ''dixi'' ({{zh|t=嫡系}}, "direct descent") group, which comprised divisions trained by the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] and loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and can be considered the Central Army ({{zh|t=中央軍}}) of the NRA. The second group is known as the ''zapai'' ({{zh|t=雜牌}}, "miscellaneous units"), and comprised all divisions led by non-Whampoa commanders, and is more often known as the Regional Army or the Provincial Army ({{zh|t=省軍}}).

Even though both military groups were part of the National Revolutionary Army, their distinction lies much in their allegiance to the central government of Chiang Kai-shek. Many former warlords and regional militarists were incorporated into the NRA under the flag of the [[Kuomintang]], but in reality they retained much independence from the central government. They also controlled much of the military strength of China, the most notable of them being the [[New Guangxi clique|Guangxi]], [[Shanxi clique|Shanxi]], [[Yunnan clique|Yunnan]] and [[Ma clique]]s.

Although during the war the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] forces fought as a nominal part of the NRA, the number of those on the Communist side, due to their [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] status, is difficult to determine, though estimates place the total number of the [[Eighth Route Army]], [[New Fourth Army]], and irregulars in the Communist armies at 1,300,000.

The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had approximately 3,200,000 regulars. More Japanese troops were quartered in China than deployed elsewhere in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] during the war. Japanese divisions ranged from 20,000 men in its divisions numbered less than 100, to 10,000 men in divisions numbered greater than 100.

At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the IJA had 51 divisions, of which 35 were in China, and 39 independent brigades, of which all but one were in China. This represented roughly 80% of the IJA's manpower.

{{Main|Collaborationist Chinese Army}}
The Chinese armies allied to Japan had only 78,000 people in 1938, but had grown to around 649,640 men by 1943,<ref>Jowett, Phillip, Rays of the Rising Sun, pg.130–133.</ref> and reached a maximum strength of 900,000 troops before the end of the war. Almost all of them belonged to [[Manchukuo]], [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] ([[Beijing]]), [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] ([[Nanjing]]) and the later Nanjing Nationalist Government ([[Wang Jingwei regime]]). These collaborator troops were mainly assigned to garrison and logistics duties in their own territories, and were rarely fielded in combat because of low morale and Japanese distrust. They fared very poorly in skirmishes against both Chinese NRA and Communist forces.

{{See also|Development of Chinese armoured forces (1927–1945)|List of aircraft used in China before 1937|Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)|List of World War II firearms of China}}

The Central Army possessed 80 Army infantry divisions with approximately 8,000 men each, nine independent [[brigade]]s, nine cavalry divisions, two [[Artillery|artillery brigades]], 16 artillery [[regiment]]s and three armored battalions. The [[Republic of China Navy|Chinese Navy]] displaced only 59,000 tonnes and the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] comprised only about 700 obsolete aircraft.

Chinese weapons were mainly produced in the [[Hanyang Arsenal|Hanyang]] and [[Guangdong]] arsenals. However, for most of the [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained division]]s, the standard firearms were German-made [[7.92x57mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[Gewehr 98]] and [[Karabiner 98k]]. A local variant of the 98k style rifles were often called the "[[Chiang Kai-shek rifle]]" a Chinese copy from the ''Mauser Standard Modell''. Another rifle they used was [[Hanyang 88]]. The standard [[light machine gun]] was a local copy of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] [[8 mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[ZB vz. 26|Brno ZB26]]. There were also Belgian and French LMGs. Surprisingly, the NRA did not purchase any of the famous ''[[MG 34|Maschinengewehr 34]]''s from Germany, but did produce their own copies of them. On average in these divisions, there was one machine gun set for each [[platoon]]. [[Heavy machine gun]]s were mainly locally-made Type 1924 [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] [[Maxim gun]]s, from German [[blueprint]]s. On average every [[battalion]] would get one HMG. The standard sidearm was the [[7 mm caliber|7.63 mm]] [[Mauser C96|Mauser M1932]] [[semi-automatic pistol]]

Some divisions were equipped with 37&nbsp;mm [[3.7 cm Pak 36|PaK 35/36]] [[Anti-tank guns|anti-tank gun]]s, and/or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s from [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], Madsen and [[Solothurn]]. Each infantry division had 6 French Brandt 81&nbsp;mm [[Field gun|mortars]] and 6 Solothurn 20&nbsp;mm [[autocannon]]s. Some independent brigades and artillery regiments were equipped with [[Bofors]] 72&nbsp;mm L/14, or [[Krupp]] 72&nbsp;mm L/29 [[mountain gun]]s. They were 24 ''[[Rheinmetall]]'' 150&nbsp;mm [[15 cm sFH 18|L/32 sFH 18]] [[howitzer]]s (bought in 1934) and 24 Krupp 150&nbsp;mm [[15 cm sFH 18|L/30 sFH 18]] howitzers (bought in 1936).

Infantry uniforms were basically redesigned [[Mao suit|Zhongshan suit]]s. Leg wrappings are standard for soldiers and officers alike since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. The helmets were the most distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German M35 [[Stahlhelm]] helmets (standard issue for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' until late in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]]) rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, each with the 12-ray sun emblem of the ROC on the sides. Other equipment included cloth shoes for soldiers, leather shoes for officers and leather boots for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition, ammunition pouch/harness, a water flask, combat knives, food bag and a [[gas mask]].

On the other hand, warlord forces varied greatly in terms of equipment and training. Some warlord troops were notoriously under-equipped, such as [[Shanxi]]'s [[Dadao]] (大刀, a one-bladed sword type close combat weapon) Team and the [[Yunnan clique]]. Some, however, were highly professional forces with their own air force and navies. The quality of the [[New Guangxi clique]] was almost on par with the Central Army, as the [[Guangzhou]] region was wealthy and the local army could afford foreign instructors and arms. The Muslim [[Ma clique]] to the northwest was famed for its well-trained [[cavalry]] divisions.

Although Japan possessed significant mobile operational capacity, it did not possess capability for maintaining a long sustained war. At the beginning of the war, the Imperial Japanese Army comprised 17 divisions, each composed of approximately 22,000 men, 5,800 horses, 9,500 rifles and [[submachine gun]]s, 600 heavy machine guns of assorted types, 108 artillery pieces, and 600 plus of light armor two-men tanks. [[Special forces]] were also available. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] displaced a total of 1,900,000 tonnes, ranking third in the world, and possessed 2,700 aircraft at the time. Each Japanese division was the equivalent in fighting strength of four Chinese regular divisions (at the beginning of the [[Battle of Shanghai]]).
