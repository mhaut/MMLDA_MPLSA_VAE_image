[[Image:Crâne mouton.jpg|thumb|A sheep's skull]]
Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a [[Crimp (wool)|crimped]] hair called wool and often with horns forming a [[Laterally|lateral]] [[spiral]]. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely [[Neoteny|neotenic]] as a result of selective breeding by humans.<ref>Budiansky, pp. 97–98.</ref><ref>Budianksy, pp. 100–01.</ref> A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (polled), or horns in both sexes (as in wild sheep), or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.<ref name="sheep and goat"/>

Another trait unique to domestic sheep (as compared to wild ovines, not other livestock) is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation with species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown and even spotted or [[piebald]].<ref name="rmcsba"/><ref name="bcsba"/> Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a [[dominant trait]] it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a [[recessive]] trait in white flocks.<ref name="rmcsba">{{cite web |url=http://www.rmncsba.org/ |title=Natural Colored Sheep |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Natural Colored Sheep Breeders Association |month=January | year=2007 |work=Rare Breeds Watchlist }}</ref><ref name="bcsba">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsba.org.uk/coloured-sheep/coloured-sheep.html |title=An introduction to coloured sheep |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher= British Coloured Sheep Breeders Association }}</ref> While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a [[niche market]] for colored fleeces, mostly for [[handspinning]].<ref name="hobby"/>  The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hair-like. There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so [[wool classing]] is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.

[[Image:Take ours!.jpg|thumb|left|[[Suffolk sheep|Suffolks]] are a medium wool, black-faced breed of meat sheep that make up 60% of the sheep population in the U.S.<ref name="storey"/>]]
Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a [[heritable]] trait that is often selected for in breeding.<ref name="storey"/> Ewes typically weigh between {{Convert|45|and|100|kg|lb}}, and rams between {{Convert|45|and|160|kg|lb}}.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |author=Melinda J. Burrill Ph.D. Professor Coordinator of Graduate Studies, Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, California State Polytechnic University |title =Sheep |encyclopedia=World Book |publisher=Mackiev}}</ref> Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw.  These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight [[incisor]]s, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped [[Canine tooth|canine]]s.  This means that the [[Dentition|dental formula]] for sheep is either I:0/4 C:0/0 P:3/3 M:3/3, or I:0/3 C:0/1 P:3/3 M:3/3.<ref>[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/pregastric/cowpage.html Dental Anatomy of Ruminants from Colorado State University]</ref>  There is a large toothless gap between the front "biting" teeth and the rear "grinding" teeth.

For the first few years of life it is possible to calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of [[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]] is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age.  The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal. For this reason, domestic sheep on normal [[pasture]] begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the average life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years.<ref name="sheep and goat">Ensminger</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Schoenian | first =Susan | title =Sheep Basics | work =Sheep101.info | url =http://www.sheep101.info/sheepbasics.html | accessdate =2007-11-27 }}</ref><ref name="begin">Smith et al.</ref>

Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled.<ref name=smith5>Smith et al., p. 5.</ref> Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, possessing excellent [[peripheral vision]]; with visual fields of approximately 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads.<ref name="hobby">Weaver</ref><ref name="ASI">{{cite journal |last=Shulaw |first=Dr. William P.|year=2006 |title=Sheep Care Guide |url=http://www.sheepusa.org/index.phtml?page=site/get_file&print=1&file_id=9a0f14975be048606228762fc2d2a7ff |publisher=American Sheep Industry Association|accessdate= 2008-09-08 }}</ref> However, sheep have poor [[depth perception]]; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk. In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas,<ref name="modern"/> and prefer to move uphill when disturbed.  Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet. The purpose of these glands is uncertain,<ref name="Smith4"/> but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors.<ref name="storey"/> The foot glands might also be related to reproduction,<ref name="storey"/> but alternative reasons, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.<ref name="Smith4">Smith et al., p. 4.</ref>

Sheep and [[goat]]s are closely related as both are in the subfamily [[Caprinae]]. However, they are separate species, so [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a [[sheep-goat hybrid]] (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and is not to be confused with the [[Chimera (genetics)|genetic chimera]] called a [[geep]]. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard and divided upper lip unique to goats. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or [[Docking (animal)|docked]], while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Sheep breeds are also often naturally [[polled]] (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], whereas rams do not.<ref name="begin"/>

Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the [[topography]] for which the breed has been developed. This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds.<ref name="modern">{{cite book |title=The Modern Shepherd |last=Brown |first=Dave |coauthors= Sam Meadowcroft |year=1996 |publisher=Farming Press |location=Wharfedale Road, Ipswich 1P1 4LG, United Kingdom |isbn=0-85236-188-2 }}</ref> A sheep may also be of a [[fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed type]], which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.

Breeds are also grouped based on how well they are suited to producing a certain type of breeding stock. Generally, sheep are thought to be either "ewe breeds" or "ram breeds". Ewe breeds are those that are hardy, and have good reproductive and mothering capabilities &ndash; they are for replacing breeding ewes in standing flocks. Ram breeds are selected for rapid growth and carcase quality, and are mated with ewe breeds to produce meat lambs. Lowland and upland breeds are also crossed in this fashion, with the hardy hill ewes crossed with larger, fast-growing lowland rams to produce ewes called [[Mule (sheep)|mules]], which can then be crossed with meat-type rams to produce prime market lambs.<ref name="modern"/> Many breeds, especially rare or primitive ones, fall into no clear category.
[[Image:Barbados Blackbelly.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Barbados Blackbelly]] is a hair sheep breed of [[Caribbean]] origin.]]
Breeds are categorized by the type of their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from [[Merino (sheep)|Merino]] sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry.  Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces.<ref name="D’Arcy">D’Arcy, J.B., Sheep Management & Wool Technology, NSW University Press, 1986, ISBN 0 86840 106 4</ref> Some major medium wool breeds, such as the [[Corriedale sheep|Corriedale]], are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]] breed was developed by crossing [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln]] rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled [[Rambouillet (sheep)|Rambouillet]] ewes.

Coarse or [[carpet]] wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.<ref name="living"/>

A minor class of sheep are the [[dairy]] breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep do produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dairy Sheep Nutrition |last=Pulina |first=Giuseppe |coauthors=Roberta Bencini |year=2004 |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=0851995950 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rTdfR3UxWXQC&dq=dairy+sheep+breeds}}</ref> In the quality of their milk, fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds but lactose content does not.<ref name="Pulina2">Pulina et al. p. 2.</ref>

A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the [[Dorper (sheep)|Dorper]], result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing.<ref name="living"/> Hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.<ref name="begin"/>

With the modern rise of corporate [[agribusiness]] and the decline of localized [[family farm]]s, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction.

Diet

<text>

[[Image:German ewe grazing closeup.jpg|thumb|upright|A ewe grazing]]
Sheep are exclusively [[herbivorous]] mammals. Most breeds prefer to graze on [[grass]] and other short [[roughage]], avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume.<ref>Pugh, pp. 19.</ref> Both sheep and goats use their [[lip]]s and [[tongue]]s to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition.<ref>Pugh, pp. 19.</ref> Sheep, however, graze well in [[monoculture]] pastures where most goats fare poorly.<ref>Pugh, pp. 19.</ref> Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex [[digestive system]] composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down [[cellulose]] from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler [[carbohydrate]]s. When sheep [[Grazing|graze]], vegetation is chewed into a mass called a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]], which is then passed into the first chamber: the [[rumen]]. The rumen is a 19 to 38-liter (5 to 10 gal) organ in which feed is [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] via a [[symbiotic]] relationship with the [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], and [[yeast]]s of the [[gut flora]].<ref name=simmons146>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 146.</ref> The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as [[cud]] for additional chewing and [[salivation]].<ref name=simmons146/> Cud chewing is an [[adaptation]] allowing ruminants to graze more quickly in the morning, and then fully chew and digest feed later in the day.<ref>Smith et al., p. 56.</ref> This is beneficial as grazing, which requires lowering the head, leaves sheep vulnerable to predators, while cud chewing does not.<ref name="begin"/>
[[Image:Rumen-sheep2.jpg|thumb|left|A sheep's ruminant system]]
During fermentation, the rumen produces gas that must be expelled; disturbances of the organ, such as sudden changes in a sheep's diet, can cause the potentially fatal condition of [[bloat]], when gas becomes trapped in the rumen. After fermentation in the rumen, feed passes in to the [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]] and the [[omasum]]; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether. After the first three chambers, food moves in to the [[abomasum]] for final digestion before processing by the [[intestine]]s. The abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach (being the only one that absorbs nutrients for use as energy), and is sometimes called the "true stomach".<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 171.</ref>

Sheep follow a [[diurnality|diurnal]] pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their [[cud]]. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawn-like grass, but an array of [[grass]]es, [[legume]]s and [[forb]]s.<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 82.</ref> Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) oak and acorns, tomato, [[Taxus|yew]], rhubarb, potato, and [[rhododendron]].<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 160.</ref>

[[Image:SnakeValley.JPG|thumb|right|Sheep graze on public land in [[Snake Valley (Great Basin)|Snake Valley]], [[Utah]].]]
Sheep are largely [[grazing]] herbivores, unlike [[Browsing (predation)|browsing]] animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can [[overgraze]] a pasture much faster than cattle.<ref name="begin"/> For this reason, many shepherds use [[managed intensive rotational grazing]], where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover.<ref name="begin"/><ref name="modern"/> Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of [[invasive species|invasive plant species]]. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as [[cheatgrass]], [[leafy spurge]], [[kudzu]] and [[spotted knapweed]] over native species such as [[sagebrush]], making grazing sheep effective for [[conservation grazing]].<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 143.</ref> Research conducted in [[Imperial County, California]] compared lamb grazing with [[herbicides]] for [[weed]] control in seedling [[alfalfa]] fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. [[Entomologist]]s also compared grazing lambs to [[insecticides]] for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucanr.org/delivers/impactview.cfm?impactnum=176 |title=Sheep grazing reduces pesticide use in alfalfa |work=ucanr.org |publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources }}</ref>

Other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is [[hay]], often during the winter months. The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet.<ref name="living"/> Also included in some sheep's diets are [[mineral]]s, either in a trace mix or in [[Salt lick|licks]].

Naturally, a constant source of [[potable]] water is also a fundamental requirement for sheep. The amount of water needed by sheep fluctuates with the season and the type and quality of the food they consume.<ref name=wooster64>Wooster, p. 64.</ref> When sheep feed on large amounts of new growth and there is [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (including [[dew]], as sheep are dawn feeders), sheep need less water. When sheep are confined or are eating large amounts of cured [[hay]], more water is typically needed. Sheep also require clean water, and may refuse to drink water that is covered in [[Wiktionary:scum|scum]] or [[algae]].<ref name=wooster64/>

Sheep are one of the few livestock animals raised for meat today that have never been widely raised in an [[Intensive farming|intensive]], [[confined animal feeding operation]] (CAFO).<ref name="hobby"/> Although there is a growing movement advocating alternative farming styles, a large percentage of [[beef]] cattle, [[pig]]s, and [[poultry]] are still produced under such conditions.<ref name="storey"/> In contrast, only some sheep are regularly given high-concentration grain feed, much less kept in confinement. Especially in industrialized countries, sheep producers may fatten market lambs before slaughter (called "finishing") in [[feedlot]]s.<ref name="begin"/> Many sheep breeders [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|flush]] ewes and rams with a daily ration of grain during breeding to increase [[fertility]].<ref>Smith et al., p. 101.</ref> Ewes are also flushed during pregnancy to increase birth weights, as 70% of a lamb's growth occurs in the last five to six weeks of gestation.<ref name="hobby"/> Otherwise, only lactating ewes and especially old or infirm sheep are commonly provided with grain.<ref name="hobby"/><ref name="living"/> Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of [[copper]] that are lethal to sheep.<ref name="hobby"/> The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as [[salt lick]]s.<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 159.</ref>

Behavior and intelligence
</heading>
<text>

[[Image:Border Collie sheepdog trial.jpg|thumb|250px|Sheep showing flocking behavior during a [[sheepdog trial]]]]
Sheep are [[Predation|prey]] animals with a strong gregarious instinct, and a majority of sheep behaviors can be understood in these terms. The [[dominance hierarchy]] of ''Ovis aries'' and its natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in it being one of the first domesticated livestock species.<ref name="wild">Budiansky</ref> All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed.<ref name=smith5/> Farmers exploit this behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures and to move them more easily. Shepherds may also use [[herding dog]]s in this effort, whose highly bred [[herding]] ability can assist in moving flocks. Sheep are also extremely food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food.<ref>Budiasnky p. 100 et al.</ref> Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed, rather than forcing their movements with herding.<ref>Budiansky p. 100.</ref><ref>Wooster pp. 73, 75.</ref>

In regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.<ref name="begin"/> Sheep can also become [[hefted]] to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes. Ewes teach the heft to their lambs, and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.<ref name="storey"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1634526.stm| publisher=BBC News| date=2001-11-03| title=Sheep taught to stay put| accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref>
[[Image:Round 'em up.jpg|thumb|left|Escaped sheep being led back to pasture with the enticement of food. This method of moving sheep works best with smaller flocks.]]
Flock dynamics in sheep are, as a rule, only exhibited in a group of four or more sheep. Fewer sheep may not react as normally expected when alone or with few other sheep.<ref name="hobby"/> For sheep, the primary defense mechanism is simply to flee from danger when their [[flight zone]] is crossed. Secondly, cornered sheep may charge or threaten to do so through hoof stamping and aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.<ref name="hobby"/>

In displaying flocking, sheep have a strong lead-follow tendency, and a leader often as not is simply the first sheep to move. However, sheep do establish a [[pecking order]] through physical displays of dominance. Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at [[wiktionary:trough|trough]]s.<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 8.</ref> Primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy.<ref name="Budiansky78">Budiansky p. 78.</ref> Rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish pecking order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so.<ref name="Budiansky78"/>

Reproduction

{{Main|Domestic sheep reproduction}}
[[Image:Emerging lamb cropped.jpg|thumb|The second of twins being born on a New Zealand pasture]]
Sheep follow a similar [[Reproduction|reproductive]] strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in [[feral]] populations).<ref name="living"/> Most sheep are [[seasonal breeder]]s, although some are able to breed year-round.<ref name="living"/> Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months of age, and rams generally at four to six months.<ref name="living"/> Ewes have [[estrus]] cycles about every 17 days,<ref>Wooster, p. 111.</ref> during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of sheep display a preference for [[Homosexual behavior in animals|homosexuality]] (8% on average)<ref name="nyt"/> or are [[freemartin]]s (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning [[Ovary|ovaries]]).<ref name="freemartin">{{cite journal |last=Padula |first=A.M. |year=2005 |title=The freemartin syndrome: an update. |journal=Animal Reproduction Science |volume= 87|issue= 1/2 |pages=pp. 93–109 |url=http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053098181 |doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2004.09.008 |pmid=15885443 |format=}} {{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

In feral sheep, rams may fight during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely.<ref name="living"/> During the rut, even normally friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.<ref name="storey"/>

After mating, sheep have a [[gestation]] period of about five months,<ref>Wooster, p. 71.</ref> and normal labor take one to three hours.<ref>Wooster, p. 124.</ref> Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.<ref name="storey"/><ref name="quints">{{cite news |title=Quintuplet birth takes sheep breeder by surprise |url=http://www.praguemonitor.com/en/258/czech_business/17581/ |work=Prague Daily Monitor |publisher=Czech News Agency |date= 2008-01-24 |accessdate=2008-01-25 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080129030117/http://www.praguemonitor.com/en/258/czech_business/17581/| archivedate = January 29, 2008}}</ref> During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|lambing jugs]],<ref>Smith, et al., p. 32.</ref> small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.<ref name="modern"/><ref name="living"/> [[Image:Lamb first steps (edited).jpg|thumb|left|A lamb's first steps]]

Ovine [[obstetrics]] can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding.<ref>Budiansky, pp. 122–23.</ref> In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs.<ref name="living"/> After the birth, ewes ideally break the [[amniotic sac]] (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb.<ref name="living"/> Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth.<ref name="living"/> In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital [[colostrum]] milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or that are rejected by the ewe require aid to live, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.<ref>Smith et al., p. 110.</ref>

After lambs are several weeks old, [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|lamb marking]] (the process of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|ear tagging]], [[Docking (animal)|docking]], and [[castrating]]) is carried out.<ref name="living"/> Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied for ease of later identification of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to avoid the procedure for ethical, economic or practical reasons.<ref name="living"/> Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated.<ref name="modern"/> Docking, which is the shortening of a lamb's tail, is practised for health reasons.<ref>Smith, et al., p. 112.</ref> Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.<ref name="storey"/><ref name="living"/>

Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drugs companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve drugs for ovine use.<ref>Smith et al., p. 95.</ref> In such instances, shepherds resort to illegal, extra-label usage of drugs approved for other animals.<ref name="storey"/> In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as [[homeopathy]], [[herbalism]] and even [[traditional Chinese medicine]] to treat sheep veterinary problems.<ref name="hobby"/><ref name="storey"/> Despite some favorable [[anecdotal evidence]], the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in [[scientific journal]]s.<ref name="hobby"/><ref name="storey"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Paolo Bellavite, Riccardo Ortolani, and Anita Conforti |year=2006 |month=June |title=Immunology and Homeopathy.

Many breeders take a variety of [[Preventive medicine|preventive measures]] to ward off problems. The first is to ensure that all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior.<ref name="storey"/> This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and [[Quarantine|quarantining]] new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. Handling sheep in loud, erratic ways causes them to produce [[cortisol]], a [[stress hormone]]. This can lead to a weakened [[immune system]], thus making sheep far more vulnerable to disease.<ref name="hobby"/> Signs of stress in sheep include: excessive [[panting]], [[teeth grinding]], restless movement, wool eating, and wood chewing.<ref name="hobby"/> Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are [[pesticide]] sprays, inorganic [[fertilizer]], [[motor oil]], as well as radiator [[coolant]] (the [[ethylene glycol]] [[antifreeze]] is sweet-tasting).<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 161.</ref> [[Image:Sheep with orf.jpg|thumb|left|A sheep infected with Orf, a disease transmittable to humans through skin contact]]

Common forms of preventive medication for sheep are [[vaccination]]s and treatments for [[parasites]]. Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks.<ref name="storey"/> [[Worm]]s are the most common internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as [[drench]]es, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites.<ref name="modern"/>  External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep [[Hippoboscidae|ked]]s, [[nose bot]]s, [[Psorergates ovis|sheep itch mite]]s, and [[maggot]]s. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the [[bot fly]] and the [[blow-fly]]. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of [[flystrike]]. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, [[crutching]] (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Nose bots are flies that inhabit a sheep's [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliner]]s, sprays or immersive [[sheep dip]]s.<ref name="storey"/>

A wide array of bacterial diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as [[foot rot]] and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine [[Johne's disease]] is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. [[Bluetongue disease]] is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the [[mucous membrane]]s. [[Ovine rinderpest]] (or ''peste des petits ruminants'') is a highly contagious and often fatal [[virus|viral]] disease affecting sheep and goats.

A few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans. [[Orf (animal disease)|Orf]] (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous [[anthrax]] is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic [[abortion]] in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the [[prion]] disease [[scrapie]] and the [[virus]] that causes [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.<ref name="storey"/>

Predation

{{Main|Domestic sheep predation}}
[[Image:Coyotekilling.jpg|thumb|A lamb being attacked by coyotes with the most typical method, a bite to the throat]]
Other than parasites and disease, [[predation]] is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries, or simply from panic.<ref name="storey"/> However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation.<ref name="nass"/> In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry.<ref name="storey"/> Worldwide, [[Canidae|canid]]s—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sheep mauled by wild dogs |url=http://www.tweednews.com.au/?storyid=3761352&thesection=localnews&thesubsection=&thesecondsubsection= |work=Tweed Daily News |date= 2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Gareth |last=Lewis  |title=Sheep worrying leads to warning from farmers |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/debusiness/news/display.var.1980009.0.sheep_worrying_leads_to_warning_from_farmers.php |work=The Daily Echo |date= 2008-01-21 |accessdate=2008-01-21 }}</ref><ref name="canids">{{cite book |title=The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids |last=Macdonald |first=David Whyte |coauthors=Claudio Sillero-Zubiri |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0198515553 }}</ref> Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and [[Razorback|feral hogs]].<ref name="nass">{{cite web| date= 2005-05-06 |title=Sheep and Goats Death Loss | publisher=[[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] |url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1628 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref><ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 124.</ref>

Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, [[livestock guardian dog]]s, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and [[Electric fence|electric]]), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used.<ref name="living"/> More modern shepherds used guns, [[Animal trapping|traps]], and poisons to kill predators,<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 131.</ref> causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_wspredation.html |title=Effects of Wildlife Services on Predator Populations |month=October | year=2001 |publisher=Wildlife Services |accessdate=2008-01-24 }}</ref>

The 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal.<ref name="modern"/> Donkeys and [[guard llama]]s have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs.<ref name="storey"/> Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep.<ref name="living"/> In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.<ref name="storey"/>

It has been proposed that the European mouflon (''O. musimon'') is an ancient breed of domestic sheep turned [[feral]] rather than an ancestor, despite it commonly being cited as ancestor in past literature.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> A few breeds of sheep, such as the [[Castlemilk Moorit (sheep)|Castlemilk Moorit]] from Scotland, were formed through crossbreeding with wild European mouflon.

The [[urial]] (''O. vignei'') was once thought to have been a forebear of domestic sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> However, the urial, [[argali]] (''O. ammon''), and [[snow sheep]] (''O. nivicola'') have a different number of [[chromosome]]s than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and [[phylogenetic]] studies show no evidence of urial ancestry.<ref name=Hiendleder/> Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first is that there is a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hiendleder, S.; K. Mainz, Y.

Initially, sheep were kept solely for meat, milk and skins. Archaeological evidence from [[statuary]] found at sites in Iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000&nbsp;BC,<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref name="hobby"/> but the earliest woven wool garments have only been dated to two to three thousand years later.<ref>Smith et al., p. 8.</ref> By that span of the [[Bronze Age]], sheep with all the major features of modern breeds were widespread throughout [[Western Asia]].<ref name="sheep and goat"/> However, one chief difference between ancient sheep and modern breeds is the technique by which wool could be collected. Primitive sheep cannot be shorn, and must have their wool plucked out by hand in a process called "[[Glossary of sheep husbandry|rooing]]". This is because fibers called [[Kemp (wool)|kemps]] are still longer than the soft fleece. The fleece may also be collected from the field after it falls out. This trait survives today in unrefined breeds such as the [[Soay sheep|Soay]] and many [[Shetland (sheep)|Shetland]]s. Indeed, the Soay, along with other [[Northern European short-tailed sheep|Northern European breeds with short tails]], unshearable fleece, diminutive size, and horns in both sexes, are closely related to ancient sheep. Originally, weaving and spinning wool was a handicraft practiced at home, rather than an industry. [[Babylonia]]ns, [[History of Sumer|Sumerians]], and [[Persia]]ns all depended on sheep; and although [[linen]] was the first fabric to be fashioned in to clothing, wool was a prized product. The raising of flocks for their fleece was one of the earliest industries, and flocks were a medium of exchange in [[Barter|barter economies]]. Numerous [[biblical]] figures kept large flocks, and subjects of the king of Israel were taxed according to the number of rams they owned.<ref name="sheep and goat"/>

Sheep husbandry spread quickly in  [[Europe]].  Excavations show that In about 6000 BC, during the [[Neolithic]] period of prehistory,  the Castelnovien people, living around [[Chateauneuf-les-Martigues]] near present-day [[Marseille]] in the south of France,  were among the first in Europe to keep domestic sheep.<ref>Max Escalon de Fonton, ''L'Homme avant l'histoire'', pg). 16-17, in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990.

Later, the [[Roman Empire]] kept sheep on a wide scale, and the Romans were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising throughout the continent. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] (''Naturalis Historia''), speaks at length about sheep and wool.<ref name="pliny">{{cite web |author=[[Pliny the Elder]] | title= [[Naturalis Historia]] | date= AD 77 | pages=  Chapters 72–25 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23397;layout=;loc=8.73 | accessdate=2007-12-29 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> Declaring "Many thanks, too, do we owe to the sheep, both for appeasing the gods, and for giving us the use of its fleece.", he goes on to detail the breeds of ancient sheep and the many colors, lengths and qualities of wool.<ref name="pliny"/> Romans also pioneered the practice of blanketing sheep, in which a fitted coat (today usually of [[nylon]]) is placed over the sheep to improve the cleanliness and luster of its wool.<ref name="sheep and goat"/>

During the Roman occupation of the British Isles, a large wool processing factory was established in [[Winchester, England]] in about [[50 AD]].<ref name="hobby"/> By [[1000 AD]], [[England]] and [[Spain]] were recognized as the twin centers of sheep production in the Western world.<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref name="hobby"/> As the original breeders of the fine-wooled merino sheep that have historically dominated the wool trade, the Spanish gained great wealth.

''Mesta'' flocks followed a seasonal pattern of [[transhumance]] across Spain.

[[File:Swaledale sheep.jpg|thumb|left|Sheep are often identified by farmers by using a paint mark called a ''raddle''.]]

Exportation of merinos without royal permission was also a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After the breaking of the export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to [[Rambouillet]] by [[Louis XVI]] in 1786 formed the basis for the modern [[Rambouillet (sheep)|Rambouillet]] (or French Merino) breed.<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 66.</ref> After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the [[Churra (sheep)|Churra]], and was no longer of international economic significance.

The sheep industry in Spain was an instance of migratory flock management, with large [[Homogeneity (ecology)|homogenous]] flocks ranging over the entire nation. The management model used in England was quite different but had a similar importance to economy of the [[British Empire]]. Up until the early 20th century, [[owling]] (the smuggling of sheep or wool out of the country) was a punishable offense, and to this day the [[Lord Speaker]] of the [[House of Lords]] sits on a cushion known as the [[Woolsack]].

The high concentration and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the UK allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby giving rise to an exceptional variety of breeds in relation to the land mass of the country.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> This greater variety of breeds also produced a valuable variety of products to compete with the superfine wool of Spanish sheep.

The next transport of sheep to North America was not until 1607, with the voyage of the ''HMS Susan Conant'' to [[Virginia]].<ref name="sheep and goat"/>  However, the sheep that arrived in that year were all slaughtered because of a famine, and a permanent flock was not to reach the colony until two years later in 1609.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> In two decades time, the colonists had expanded their flock to a total of 400 head. By the 1640s there were about 100,000 head of sheep in the 13 colonies, and in 1662, a woolen mill was built in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref name="hobby"/> Especially during the periods of political unrest and civil war in Britain spanning the 1640s and 50s which disrupted maritime trade, the colonists found it pressing to produce wool for clothing.<ref name="empire">{{cite book |title=Creatures of Empire: How Domestic Animals Transformed Early America |last=Anderson |first=Virginia DeJohn |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195304462 |pages=147–48 }}</ref> Many islands off the coast were cleared of predators and set aside for sheep: [[Nantucket]], [[Long Island]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] and small islands in [[Boston Harbor]] were notable examples.<ref name="empire"/> There remain some rare breeds of American sheep—such as the [[Hog Island sheep]]—that were the result of island flocks.

Gradually, beginning in the 19th century, sheep production in the U.S. moved westward. Today, the vast majority of flocks reside on Western range lands. During this westward migration of the industry, competition between sheep (sometime called "range maggots") and cattle operations grew more heated, eventually erupting into [[range war]]s.<ref>http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte2/hrs10a.htm</ref> Other than simple competition for [[grazing rights|grazing]] and [[water right]]s, cattlemen believed that the secretions of the foot glands of sheep made cattle unwilling to graze on places where sheep had stepped.<ref name="begin"/><ref name="Smith4"/> As sheep production centered on the U.S. western ranges, it became associated with other parts of Western culture, such as the [[rodeo]]. In modern America, a minor event in rodeos is [[mutton busting]], in which children compete to see who can stay atop a sheep the longest before falling off. Another effect of the westward movement of sheep flocks in North America was the decline of wild species such as [[Bighorn sheep]] (''O. canadesis''). Most diseases of domestic sheep are transmittable to wild ovines, and such diseases, along with overgrazing and habitat loss, are named as primary factors in the plummeting numbers of wild sheep.<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Forstenzer

Flocks in Australia have always been largely range bands on fenced land, and are aimed at production of medium to superfine wool for clothing and other products as well as meat. New Zealand flocks are kept in a fashion similar to English ones, in fenced holdings without shepherds.

Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials. Wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for [[synthetic fabric]]s.<ref name="hobby"/> For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without [[farm subsidies]].<ref name="hobby"/> Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as [[wool insulation]].<ref>Wooster, p.ix.</ref> In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.<ref name="modern"/>

[[Sheepskin]] is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products.

Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to agriculture.<ref name="storey"/>  Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb.  "Mutton" is derived from the [[Old French]] ''moton'', which was the word for sheep used by the [[Normans|Anglo-Norman]] rulers of much of the British Isles in the [[Middle Ages]]. This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''sceap'' was kept for the live animal.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1933: Mutton, Sheep, Beef.</ref> Throughout modern history, "mutton" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; "lamb" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mutton |title=Mutton |accessdate=2008-01-23 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muttonrenaissance.org.uk/whatIsMutton.php |title=What Is Mutton?

In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the [[Persian Gulf]] states, New Zealand, Australia, [[Greece]], [[Uruguay]], the United Kingdom and Ireland.<ref name="hobby"/> These countries eat 14–40&nbsp;lbs (3–18&nbsp;kg) of sheep meat [[per capita]], [[per annum]].<ref name="hobby"/><ref name="ado"/> Sheep meat is also popular in [[France]], Africa (especially the [[Maghreb]]), the [[Caribbean]], the rest of the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and parts of [[China]].<ref name="ado"/> This often reflects a past history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and [[offal]] may be popular or traditional. Sheep [[testicle]]s—called [[animelles]] or [[lamb fries]]—are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish [[haggis]], composed of various sheep [[offal|innards]] cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach.<ref>Smith et al., p. 147.</ref>  In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5&nbsp;kg), with Americans eating 50&nbsp;pounds (22&nbsp;kg) of pork and 65&nbsp;pounds (29&nbsp;kg) of beef.<ref name="ado"/> In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly [[Meat chop|lamb chops]] and [[leg of lamb]].<ref name="hobby"/>

Though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napcsyr.org/dwnld-files/divisions/tpd/pubs/comd_brf/en/04_cbrf_sheep_en.pdf |title=Sheep Trade in Syria |work=napcsyr.org |publisher=National Agricultural Policy Center, Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, [[Syrian Arab Republic]] }}</ref> today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two [[teat]]s, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows.<ref name="storey"/> However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, [[Milk solids|solids]], and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process.<ref name="Pulina2"/> It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher [[calcium]] content.<ref name="Pulina2"/>  Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the [[Feta]] of [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]], [[Roquefort]] of France, [[Manchego]] from Spain, the [[Pecorino Romano cheese|Pecorino Romano]] (the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for sheep is ''pecore'') and [[Ricotta]] of [[Italy]].

Cultural impact

{{See also|List of fictional sheep|Bellwether}}
Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led, if not outright stupid.<ref name="mw">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheep |title=Sheep |accessdate=2007-12-01 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}</ref> In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power, such as for the [[St. Louis Rams]] and the [[Dodge Ram]]. Sheep are key symbols in [[fable]]s and [[nursery rhyme]]s like ''[[The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing]]'', ''[[Little Bo Peep]]'', ''[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]'', and ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''. Novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', [[Haruki Murakami]]'s ''[[A Wild Sheep Chase]]'', [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' and ''[[Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Story]]'' utilize sheep as characters or [[plot device]]s. Poems like [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]", songs such as [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]'' and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] aria ''[[Sheep may safely graze]]'' (''Schafe können sicher weiden'') use sheep for [[metaphor]]ical purposes. In more recent popular culture, the 2007 film ''[[Black Sheep (2007 film)|Black Sheep]]'' exploits sheep for horror and comedic effect, ironically turning them into blood-thirsty killers.[[File:Black sheep-1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The proverbial black sheep]]

[[Counting sheep]] is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some [[Yan Tan Tethera|ancient systems of counting sheep]] persist today. Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and [[idiom]] frequently with such phrases as "[[black sheep]]". To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group.<ref name="AHD">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=9re1vfFh04sC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=american+heritage+dictionary+%22black+sheep%22 |title=American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms |publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2007-11-13 |isbn=9780395727744 |author1=Ammer, Christine |year=1997}}</ref> This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born in to an entirely white flock. These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool.<ref name="AHD"/> Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the [[Portmanteau word|Portmanteau]] [[neologism]] of [[sheeple]]. Somewhat differently, the adjective "sheepish" is also used to describe embarrassment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheepish |title=Sheepish |accessdate=2007-12-01 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}</ref>

In antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the [[ancient Near East]], the [[Mideast]], and the [[Mediterranean]] area: [[Çatalhöyük]], ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, [[Judaism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek religion]], and others. Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths: skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE.<ref>Budiansky, p. 159.</ref> In [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], the ram was the symbol of several gods: [[Khnum]], [[Heryshaf]] and [[Amun]] (in his incarnation as a god of [[fertility]]).<ref name="hobby"/> Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include: the goddess [[Ishtar]], the [[Phoenicia]]n god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes.<ref name="hobby"/> In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.<ref name = Cooper92>{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=JC |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |page=219 |year=1992 |publisher= Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=1-85538-118-4}}</ref>

There are also many ancient Greek references to sheep: that of [[Chrysomallos]], the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era. [[Astrology|Astrologically]], ''[[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]'', the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek [[zodiac]] and the sheep is also the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the [[Chinese zodiac]], related to the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref name = Cooper92/> In [[Mongolia]], [[shagai]] are an ancient form of dice made from the [[cuboid bone]]s of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes. 

Sheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]], [[King David]] and the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] were all shepherds. According to the Biblical story of the [[Binding of Isaac]], a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael). [[Eid al-Adha]] is a major annual festival in [[Islam]] in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act.<ref name="Eid">{{cite web | title = Eid ul Adha (10 Dhul-Hijja) - the festival of sacrifice| publisher = BBC| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/eiduladha.shtml| accessdate = 2008-01-08}}</ref><ref name="sweetness">{{cite web | title = Eid Festival Around The World - Graphic photos| publisher = Sweetness & Light| url = http://sweetness-light.com/archive/the-eid-festival-around-the-world-graphic-photos| accessdate = 2008-01-08}}</ref> Sheep are also occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important [[secular]] events in Islamic cultures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/bloody-blessing-goes-unnoticed/?scp=8&sq=sheep&st=cse|title=Bloody Blessing Goes Unnoticed|last=Robertson|first=Cambpell |date=August 13, 200|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> Greeks and Romans also sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and [[Judaism]] also once sacrificed sheep as a [[Korban]] (sacrifice), such as the [[Korban Pesach|Passover lamb]] .<ref name = Cooper92/> Ovine symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a [[shofar]]—still find a presence in modern Judaic traditions. Followers of [[Christianity]] are collectively often referred to as a flock, with Christ as the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], and sheep are an element in the Christian [[iconography]] of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|birth of Jesus]]. Some Christian [[saint]]s are considered [[Patron saints of occupations and activities|patrons of shepherds]], and even of sheep themselves. Christ is also portrayed as the [[Sacrificial lamb]] of God (''[[Agnus Dei]]'') and Easter celebrations in [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb.
