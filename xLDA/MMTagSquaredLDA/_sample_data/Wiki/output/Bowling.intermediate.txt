'''History'''
</heading>
<text>

There are many forms of bowling, with one of the most recent being [[ten-pin bowling]]. Primitive forms of bowling may have existed in ancient times as early as A.D. 300 in [[Germany]].<ref name="bowlingmuseum1">[http://www.bowlingmuseum.com/history.asp bowlingmuseum.com]</ref>
The first standardized rules were established in [[New York City]], on September 9, 1895.<ref>[http://www.springdaleusbc.com/bowling.htm Springdale USBC Site]</ref> Today, bowling is enjoyed by 95 million people in more than ninety countries worldwide <ref>[http://worknotes.com/Il/Chicago/fit4funkidsfitness/ap2.stm Fit4FunKids site]</ref> and continues to grow through entertainment media such as video games for home consoles and hand held devices.<ref>[http://vir2l.com/gamepages/gamepage-amfpinbusters-ngage.php/ AMF Bowling Pinbusters! for Nokia N-Gage]</ref>

Health benefits
</heading>
<text>

Bowling is an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] type of [[physical exercise]], similar to [[walking]] with [[weights|free weights]]. Bowling helps in burning calories and works muscle groups not usually exercised. The [[muscle contraction|flexing]] and [[stretching]] in bowling works [[tendon]]s, [[joint]]s, [[ligament]]s, and [[muscle]]s in the [[arm]]s and promotes [[weight loss]]. Apart from the physical benefits it also has [[Psychosocial development|psychosocial]] benefits, strengthening [[friendship]]s or creating new ones in groups.<ref>[http://www.calorie-counter.net/how-to-lose-weight/bowling-fitness.htm Calorie-counter.net - How to Lose Weight by Bowling ]</ref>

Bowling safety
</heading>
<text>

Like any other physical activity, [[warming up]] helps to prevent injuries. Bowling balls are heavy with varying weight ranges; to avoid back and [[Repetitive strain injury|wrist injury]], they should be picked up with both hands. It’s also recommended to bend one’s [[knee]]s while picking up bowling balls to avoid [[Back injury|back injuries]]. The bowling ball return mechanism has a driven wheel, and bowlers should keep their hands clear of it.  Bowlers should also warm up their fingers before inserting them into a bowling ball, to ensure that their fingers do not get stuck in the ball. <ref>[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art27530.asp BellaOnline - Personal Bowling Safety]</ref><ref>[http://www.amug.org/~a249/pinboy.html Pinboy's Guide To Better Bowling]</ref>

Types of pins
</heading>
<text>


Five main variations are found in North America, varying especially in New England and parts of Canada.

; [[Ten-pin bowling]] : largest and heaviest pins, bowled with a large ball with finger holes, and the most popular size in North America
; [[Nine-pin bowling]] : pins usually attached to strings at the tops, uses a ball without finger holes
; [[candlepin]] : tallest pins, thin with matching ends, and bowled with a handheld ball
; [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]] : short, squat, and bowled with a handheld ball
; [[fivepin]] : tall, between duckpins and candlepins in diameter with a rubber girdle, bowled with a handheld ball, mostly found in Canada.

{{main|Bowling ball}}
Bowling balls vary from game to game.  Ten-pin balls are large, up to 27 inches in circumference (approximately 8.59 inches diameter), and have as many as five holes for gripping purposes. The balls come in various weights as high as 16lbs, with the size and spacing of the finger holes often smaller on lighter balls to accommodate smaller hands.  Balls for other games can vary, candlepin balls fitting in the palm of the hand, needing no holes. Unlike most sports, the ball can be different sizes and weights based upon the player.

Shoes
</heading>
<text>

Bowling shoes possess an intermediate style between regular dressing shoes and the athletic type.  The sole of the non sliding foot is generally made of rubber similar to that of a basketball sneaker to create stability, while the sliding foot is made of a much softer material that allows a bowler to slide into his or her release. These shoes  can be bought, but they are normally rented.  <ref>[http://shoes.about.com/od/athleticshoes/bb/bybbowling.htm Using bowling shoes] About bowling online portal.

Gloves
</heading>
<text>

A bowling glove is a glove  with a metal wrist support and a textured face that offers support in order to enhance grip. There are different glove styles, including those with a full metal finger design and ones with an uncovered portion for the middle and ring fingers. <ref>[http://www.bowling-forum.net/ Bowling advice] Bowling Forums 2010-02-15</ref>

Bowling Alleys of the late 1950s and early 1960s
</heading>
<text>


Bowling alley construction was considered “an important facet” of property development in the western United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, described by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as “small cities in themselves”, some of which cost tens of millions of dollars (in 1960s dollars). The Los Angeles Times described developer [[Louis Lesser]] as “the most active in this field” of bowling alley development.

In 1960, Lesser developed a bowling alley in [[Indio, CA]], at a cost of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|750000|1962|r=0}}}} (adjusted for inflation). In 1959, he built the ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1959|r=0}}}} (adjusted for inflation) “[[Beach City]]” Santa Monica [[Civic Lanes]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], also designed to house the [[Santa Monica Civic Club]], and [[Samoa Lanes]] at 5th and Broadway in Santa Monica, both with 24 lanes “equipped with automated pinsetters, a billiard room, children’s playroom, coffee shop, and cocktail lounge”.<ref name="LAT25Jan59"> LAT 1959-01-25 $2 Million Program Set for Santa Monica</ref><ref name="LAT03Jan63">LAT, 1960-01-03, “Indio Bowling Alley Rising”</ref><ref name="LAT28Aug60"> LAT, 1960-08-28, “NOTED BOXING ARENA NOW BOWLING CENTER”</ref><ref name="LAT08Jul62">LAT, 1962-07-08, “Bowling Right Up Developers Alley”</ref><ref name="LAT24Apr60"> LAT, 1960-04-24, “Bowling Alley, Parkway Lanes”</ref>

By 1962, Lesser had developed nine bowling alleys. The biggest as of 1962 was [[Parkway Lanes]] in El Cajon, developed at a cost of ($1 million 1962) with 60 alleys, five acres of parking. The facility had “varied entertainment rivaling the best in night clubs”, according to the LA Times, with headliners such as [[Louis Prima]], [[Lili St. Cyr]], [[Johnny Ray]], [[Frankie Lane]], and [[Roberta Linn]] who appeared at Parkway, developed by Lesser with [[Irvin Kahn]] and [[George Hirsch]].

Lesser and [[Ted Bentley]] developed [[Legion Lanes]] into a 44-lane bowling alley from the [[Hollywood American Legion Stadium]] boxing arena, at El Centro and Hollywood Blvd., at a ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1962|r=0}}}} (adjusted for inflation). The facility included a playroom for children, cocktail bar, billiard room, and snack bar. [[NBC]] provided its lot for temporary parking during construction, and [[Milt  Enright]] became manager of the facility.

Also in 1962, Lesser planned development of bowling alleys in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Japan]] as bowling competed with [[cricket]], [[soccer]], and [[Rugby football|rugby]] as national pastimes in these countries.
