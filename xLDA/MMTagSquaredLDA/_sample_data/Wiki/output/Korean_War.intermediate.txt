Upon defeating the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–96), the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910) of [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]]—a peninsula strategic to its [[hegemony|sphere of influence]].<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/> A decade later, defeating [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05), Japan made Korea its [[protectorate]] with the [[Eulsa Treaty]] in 1905, then annexed it with the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty]] in 1910.<ref name="FirstYear">{{cite web|last =Schnabel |first =James F |title = United States Army in the Korean War, Policy and Direction: The First Year |url =http://www.history.army.mil/books/P&D.HTM |pages =3, 18 |accessdate = 2007-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Treaty of Annexation (Annexation of Korea by Japan) |publisher = USC-UCLA Joint East Asian Studies Center |url = http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/kore1910.htm |accessdate = 2007-08-19}}</ref>

[[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalists]] and the [[intelligentsia]] fled the country, and some founded the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|Provisional Korean Government]] in 1919, which was headed by [[Syngman Rhee]] in [[Shanghai]].

[[Korea under Japanese rule]] was considered to be part of the Empire of Japan as an industrialized [[colony]] along with [[Taiwan]], and both were part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. In 1937, the colonial Governor–General, General [[Jirō Minami]], commanded the attempted [[cultural assimilation]] of Korea's 23.5 million people by banning the use and study of Korean language, literature, and culture, to be replaced with that of mandatory use and study of their Japanese counterparts. Starting in 1939, the populace was required to use Japanese names under the [[Sōshi-kaimei]] policy. In 1938, the Colonial Government established labor conscription.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In China, the [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] helped organize refugee Korean patriots and independence fighters against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China. The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the [[Burma Campaign]] (December 1941 – August 1945). The Communists, led by [[Kim Il-sung]], fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

During World War II, the Japanese used Korea's food, livestock, and metals for their [[war effort]]. Japanese forces in Korea increased from 46,000 soldiers in 1941 to 300,000 in 1945. Japanese Korea conscripted 2.6 million forced laborers controlled with a [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] Korean police force; some 723,000 people were sent to work in the overseas empire and in metropolitan Japan. By 1942, Korean men were being conscripted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. By January 1945, Koreans comprised 32% of Japan's labor force. In August 1945, when the United States dropped [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], around 25% of those killed were Koreans.<ref name="World War II 1995 p.516"/> At the end of the war, other world powers did not recognize Japanese rule in Korea and Taiwan.

Meanwhile, at the [[Cairo Conference]] (November 1943), Nationalist China, the United Kingdom, and the United States decided "in due course Korea shall become free and independent".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Cairo Communiqué |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/002_46/002_46tx.html |publisher=National Diet Library, Japan |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Later, the [[Yalta Conference]] (February 1945) granted to the [[Soviet Union]] European "buffer zones"—[[satellite state]]s accountable to Moscow—as well as an expected Soviet pre-eminence in China and [[Manchuria]],<ref name="Goulden17">{{Cite book|last =Goulden |first =Joseph C |title = Korea: The Untold Story of the War |publisher =[[McGraw-Hill]] |year=1983 |page =17 |isbn =0070235805}}</ref> in return for joining the Allied [[Pacific War]] effort against Japan.<ref name="Goulden17" />

{{Main|Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)}}
Toward the end of World War II, as per a US-Soviet agreement, the USSR declared war against Japan on 9 August 1945.<ref name="World War II 1995 p.516"/><ref>{{Cite book|title= Drawing the Line: the Korean War 1950–53|last=Whelan |first=Richard |year= 1991|publisher= [[Little, Brown and Company]]|location= Boston|isbn= 0316934038 |page= 22 }}</ref> By 10 August, the [[Red Army]] occupied the northern part of the Korean peninsula as agreed, and on 26 August halted at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] for three weeks to await the arrival of US forces in the south.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|25}}<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|24}}

On 10 August 1945, with the 15 August [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] near, the Americans doubted whether the Soviets would honor their part of the Joint Commission, the US-sponsored Korean occupation agreement. A month earlier, Colonel [[Dean Rusk]] and Colonel [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] divided the Korean peninsula at the 38th parallel after hurriedly deciding (in thirty minutes) that the US Korean Zone of Occupation had to have a minimum of two ports.<ref name="McCullough">{{Cite book|last =McCullough |first =David |title = Truman |publisher =Simon & Schuster Paperbacks |year=1992 |pages =785, 786 |isbn =0671869205}}</ref><ref name="Appleman"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last =McCune |first =Shannon C |title =Physical Basis for Korean Boundaries |journal =Far Eastern Quarterly |volume =May 1946 |issue = 5 |pages =286–7 |date=1946-05 |postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last = Grajdanzev |first =Andrew |title =Korea Divided |journal =Far Eastern Survey |volume =XIV |page =282 |date=1945-10 |postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last =Grajdanzev |first =Andrew |title =History of Occupation of Korea |volume =I |issue =ch. 4 |page =16 |postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref>

Explaining why the occupation zone demarcation was positioned at the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, "even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by US forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement ... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops", especially when "faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area."<ref name="Goulden17"/> The Soviets agreed to the US occupation zone demarcation to improve their negotiating position regarding the occupation zones in [[Eastern Europe]], and because each would accept Japanese surrender where they stood.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|25}}

<text>

{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}

After the end of [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Chinese Civil War]] resumed between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with [[wiktionary:materiel|materiel]] and manpower.<ref name=chen110/> According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of material while thousands of Korean "volunteers" served in the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) during the war.<ref name=chen110_111>Chen 1994, pp 110–111.</ref> North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of China.<ref name=chen110>Chen 1994, p 110.</ref>

The North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 to 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they would later play a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea.<ref name=chen110/> China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea.<ref name=chen111>Chen 1994, p 111.</ref> The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists, and Kim Il-Sung's authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by [[Pak Il-yu]], who was later purged by Kim.<ref name=chen110_162>Chen 1994, pp 110, 162.</ref>

In December 1945, Korea was administered by a US–USSR Joint Commission, as agreed at the [[Moscow Conference (1945)]]. The Koreans were excluded from the talks.

After the US missions had left the People's Republic of China, CIA China station officer [[Douglas Mackiernan]] volunteered to remain and conduct spy operations. Afterward, he and a team of indigenous personnel then escaped China in a months-long horse trek across the Himalaya mountains; he was killed within miles of [[Lhasa]]. His team delivered the intelligence to headquarters that invasion was imminent. Thirteen days later, the North [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) crossed the 38th parallel border and invaded South Korea. Mackiernan was posthumously awarded the CIA [[Intelligence Star]] for valor.<ref>Gup, Ted (2000).

The Truman Administration was caught at a crossroads. Before the invasion, Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State Acheson <ref name=”Kim”>{{cite book |title= Major Powers and Korea |author=Kim |location=page 30 |publisher= Silver Spring, MD |date=1973}}</ref>. Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia. At the same time, the Administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved as well. 
	One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan. Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, “…Japan itself increasingly appeared as the major East Asian prize to be protected” <ref name=”Kim”>{{cite book |title= Major Powers and Korea |author=Kim |location=page 46 |publisher= Silver Spring, MD |date=1973}}</ref>. US East Asian experts saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region. While there was no United States policy that dealt with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan pushed South Korea to the fore. “The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman’s decision to intervene…The essential point…is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of US policy toward Japan” ” <ref name=”Kim”>{{cite book |title= Major Powers and Korea |author=Kim |location=page 46 |publisher= Silver Spring, MD |date=1973}}</ref>. The United States wanted to shore up Japan to make it a viable counterweight against the Soviet Union and China, and Korea was seen as integral to that end. 
	The other important part of committing to intervention lay in speculation about Soviet action in the event that the United States intervene. The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the US committed in Korea. At the same time, “[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]” ” <ref name=”Rees”>{{cite book |title= Korea: the Limited War |author=Rees |location=page 22 |publisher= St Martin's |date=1964}}</ref>. In Truman’s mind, this aggression, if left unchecked, would start a chain reaction that would destroy the United Nations and give the go ahead to further Communist aggression elsewhere. Korea was where a stand had to be made, the difficult part was how. 
The UN Security council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the US immediately began using air and naval forces in the area to that end. The Administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisors believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone <ref name=”Rees”>{{cite book |title= Korea: the Limited War |author=Rees |location=page 23 |publisher= St Martin's |date=1964}}</ref>. Also, it was still uncertain if this was a clever ploy by the Soviet Union to catch the US unawares or just a test of US resolve. The decision to commit ground troops and to intervene eventually became viable when a communiqué was received on June 27th from the Soviet Union that alluded it would not move against US forces in Korea. “This opened the way for the sending of American ground forces, for it now seemed less likely that a general war—with Korea as a preliminary diversion—was imminent” <ref name=”Rees”>{{cite book |title= Korea: the Limited War |author=Rees |location=page 26 |publisher= St Martin's |date=1964}}</ref>. With the Soviet Union’s tacit agreement that this would not cause an escalation, the United States now could intervene with confidence that other commitments would not be jeopardized.

On 25 June 1950, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82]]. The USSR, a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto-wielding power]], had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), not the People's Republic of China, [[China and the United Nations|held a permanent seat]] in the UN Security Council.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malkasian |first =Carter |title= The Korean War: Essential Histories |publisher= Osprey Publishing |year =2001 |page =16}}</ref> After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 83|Resolution 83]] recommending member states yield military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] ordered US air and sea forces to help the South Korean régime. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the US of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1950-gromyko-korea.html |title=Statement by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, July 4, 1950 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}</ref>

The USSR challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the Korean conflict was beyond UN Charter scope, because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war. The Soviet representative boycotted the UN to prevent Security Council action, and to challenge the legitimacy of the UN action; legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/793412 Leo Gross, "Voting in the Security Council: Abstention from Voting and Absence from Meetings", ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 60, No. 2 (Feb., 1951), pp. 209–57].</ref><ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/443348 F.

The North Korean Army launched the "Fatherland Liberation War" with a comprehensive air–land invasion using 231,000 soldiers, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them [[Kaesong]], [[Chuncheon]], [[Uijeongbu]], and [[Ongjin, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]]. Their forces included 274 [[T-34|T-34-85]] tanks, some 150 [[Yakovlev|Yak]] fighters, 110 attack bombers, 200 artillery pieces, 78 Yak trainers, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref name="Appleman" /> In addition to the invasion force, the North Korean KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.<ref name="Appleman" /> Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North Korean and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their in-country armies.

In contrast, the ROK Army defenders were vastly unprepared, and the political establishment in the south, while well aware of the threat to the north, were unable to convince American administrators of the reality of the threat. In ''South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu'' (1961), R.E. Appleman reports the ROK forces' low combat readiness as of 25 June 1950. The ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the US military, but requests were denied), and a 22–piece air force comprising 12 [[Liaison aircraft|liaison-type]] and 10 [[T-6 Texan|AT6]] advanced-trainer airplanes. There were no large foreign military garrisons in Korea at invasion time, but there were large US garrisons and air forces in Japan.<ref name="Appleman" />

Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK Army soldiers—of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee régime—were either retreating southwards or were [[Defection|defecting]] en masse to the north, to the KPA.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|23}}

Despite the rapid post–Second World War Allied demobilizations, there were substantial US forces occupying Japan; under General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s command, they could be made ready to fight the North Koreans.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|42}} Only the [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea|British Commonwealth]] had comparable forces in the area.

On Saturday, 24 June 1950, US Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] informed President Truman by telephone, "Mr. President, I have very serious news. The North Koreans have invaded South Korea."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korea: The Untold Story of the War |last= Goulden|first=Joseph C. |year= 1983|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=0070235805 |page= 48 }}</ref><ref name="Hess, Gary R. 2001">{{Cite book|title= Presidential Decisions for War : Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf|last= Hess|first=Gary R. |year=2001 |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore |isbn=0801865158 }}</ref> Truman and Acheson discussed a US invasion response with defense department principals, who agreed that the United States was obligated to repel military aggression, paralleling it with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s 1930s aggressions, and said that the mistake of [[appeasement]] must not be repeated.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Age of Global Power: The United States Since 1939|last1= Graebner|first1= Norman A.|last2=Trani |first2=Eugene P.| authorlink2=Eugene P.

:{{quote|"Communism was acting in Korea, just as Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese had ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores.

President Truman announced that the US would counter "unprovoked aggression" and "vigorously support the effort of the [UN] security council to terminate this serious breach of peace."<ref name="Hess, Gary R. 2001"/> In Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General [[Omar Bradley]] warned against appeasement, saying that Korea was the place "for drawing the line" against communist expansion. In August 1950, the President and the Secretary of State obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate $12 billion to pay for the military expenses.<ref name="Hess, Gary R. 2001"/>

Per State Secretary Acheson's recommendation, President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer materiel to the Army of the Republic of Korea while giving air cover to the evacuation of US nationals. The President disagreed with advisors who recommended unilateral US bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US Seventh Fleet]] to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Government]] asked to fight in Korea. The US denied the Nationalist Chinese request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korea: The Limited War |last=Rees |first= David|year= 1964|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |oclc=1078693 |page=27}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Osan]], the first significant engagement of the Korean War, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, which was a small forward element of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]].<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|45}} On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at [[Osan]] but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans' tanks. They were unsuccessful; the result was 180 dead, wounded, or taken prisoner. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back the US force at [[Battle of Pyongtaek|Pyongtaek]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], and [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], forcing the 24th Division's retreat to [[Daejeon|Taejeon]], which the KPA captured in the [[Battle of Taejon]];<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|48}} the 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including the Division's Commander, Major General [[William F.

In the resulting [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] (August–September 1950), the US Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at [[Battle of Naktong Bulge|the Naktong Bulge]], [[Battle of P'ohang-dong|P'ohang-dong]], and [[Battle of Taegu|Taegu]]. The [[United States Air Force]] interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support [[sortie]]s that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic, which was forced to hide in tunnels and move only at night.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|47–48}}<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|66}} To deny materiel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the US Navy air forces attacked transport hubs.

Against the rested and re-armed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN Command, they lacked naval and air support.<ref name="Stokesbury1990" />{{rp | 58, 61}}  To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] at [[Inchon]], well over 100 miles behind the KPA lines.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|67}} On 6 July, he ordered Major General [[Hobart R. Gay]], Commander, [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], to plan the division's amphibious landing at Incheon; but on 12–4 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from [[Yokohama]] to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter.<ref name = "Cavalry Outpost Publications">{{cite web|url=http://www.first-team.us/tableaux/ |title=History of the 1st Cavalry Division and Its Subordinate Commands |publisher=Cavalry Outpost Publications |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref>

Soon after the war began, General MacArthur had begun planning a landing at Incheon, but [[the Pentagon]] opposed him.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|67}} When authorized, he activated a combined United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and ROK Army force. The [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]], led by General [[Edward Almond]], Commander, consisted of 40,000 men of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and around 8,600 ROK Army soldiers.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|68}} By the 15 September attack date, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, [[psychological warfare]], [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle. However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|70}}

After the Incheon landing the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter.

On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] to the [[Taiwan Strait]], to protect the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) from the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/GEN/20th/korea.html |title=Korean War – 1950–53 |publisher=History Department at the University of San Diego |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, [[Mao Zedong]] reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force.

UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] discipline minimized aerial detection.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|102}} The PVA marched "dark-to-dark" (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away;<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|102}} PVA officers might shoot security violators.  Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-[[division (military)|division]] army to march the {{convert|286| mi}} from An-tung, Manchuria to the combat zone in some 19 days.

Meanwhile, on 10 October 1950, the 89th Tank Battalion was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division, increasing the armor available for the Northern Offensive. On 15 October, after moderate KPA resistance, the 7th Cavalry Regiment and Charlie Company, 70th Tank Battalion captured Namchonjam city. On 17 October, they flanked rightwards, away from the principal road (to Pyongyang), to capture [[Hwangju]]. Two days later, the 1st Cavalry Division captured Pyongyang, the capital city, on 19 October 1950.

After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the '''First Phase Offensive''' on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border. After decimating the ROK [[II Corps (South Korea)|II Corps]] at the [[Battle of Onjong]], the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army [[encirclement|encircled]] and attacked the US [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry Regiment]] with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the [[Battle of Unsan]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-chinter/chinter.htm |title = The Korean War: The Chinese Intervention |publisher = US Army}}</ref> The surprise assault forced the UN forces to retreat back to the [[Ch'ongch'on River]], while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared in their mountain hideouts following their victory.

The UN Command, however, were unconvinced that the Chinese had openly intervened due to the sudden Chinese withdrawal. On 24 November, the '''Home-by-Christmas Offensive''' was launched with the US Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea, while the US X Corps were attacking along the Korean east coast. But the Chinese were waiting in ambush with their '''Second Phase Offensive'''.

On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and over-ran the ROK II Corps at the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River]], and then decimated the US [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] on the UN forces' right flank.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|98–9}} The UN Command retreated; the US Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history)<ref>{{Cite book|last =Cohen |first =Eliot A |coauthors = Gooch, John |title =Military Misfortunes: The Anatomy of Failure in War | publisher =Free Press |location=New York|year=2006 |pages =165–95 |isbn =0743280822}}</ref> was made possible because of the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s successful, but very costly, rear-guard [[Battle of Wawon|delaying action near Kunuri]] that slowed the PVA attack for two days (27–9 November).

Fighting around the 38th parallel (January – June 1951)
</heading>
<text>

With Lieutenant-General [[Matthew Ridgway]] assuming the command of the US Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their '''Third Phase Offensive''' (also known as the "Chinese New Year's Offensive") on New Year's Eve of 1951, utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise. The attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy. UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers "bugged out," abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|117}} The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed the UN Command forces and the PVA and KPA in the [[Third Battle of Seoul|conquered Seoul]] on 4 January 1951.
[[Image:Korean War bombing Wonsan.jpg|thumb|[[A-26 Invader|B-26 Invaders]] bomb logistics depots in Wonsan, North Korea, 1951]]
These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using [[nuclear weapon]]s against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, with the intention that the resulting radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains.<ref>''Reminiscences''- MacArthur, Douglas.</ref> However, upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway, the ''esprit de corps'' of the bloodied Eighth Army immediately began to revive.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|113}}

UN forces retreated to [[Suwon]] in the west, [[Wonju]] in the center, and the territory north of [[Samcheok]] in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|117}} The PVA had outrun its logistics and thus was forced to recoil from pressing the attack beyond Seoul;<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|118}} food, ammunition, and materiel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines. In late January, upon finding that the enemy had abandoned the battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became [[Operation Roundup (1951)|''Operation Roundup'']] (5 February 1951),<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|121}} a full-scale X Corps advance that gradually proceeded while fully exploiting the UN Command's air superiority,<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|120}} concluding with the UN reaching the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and recapturing [[Wonju]].<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|121}}

In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the '''Fourth Phase Offensive''' and achieved a victory at [[Hoengseong]]. But the offensive was soon blunted by the [[US IX Corps|IX Corps]] positions at [[Jipyeong-ri|Chipyong-ni]] in the center.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|121}} Units of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|US 2nd Infantry Division]] and the [[French Battalion in the Korean War|French Battalion]] fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|121}}

In the last two weeks of February 1951, ''Operation Roundup'' was followed by ''[[Operation Killer]]'', carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army. It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|121}} ''Operation Killer'' concluded with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|122}} On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with ''[[Operation Ripper]]'', expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951.

Countering the initial combat imbalance, the UN Command reinforcement materiel included heavier US [[M4 Sherman]], [[M26 Pershing]], [[M46 Patton]], and British [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] and [[Centurion tank|Centurion]] tanks that proved effective against North Korean armor, ending its battlefield dominance.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|182–184}} Unlike in the Second World War (1939–45), in which the tank proved a decisive weapon, the Korean War featured few large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, heavily forested terrain prevented large masses of tanks from maneuvering. In Korea, tanks served largely as infantry support.

The Korean War was the first war in which [[jet aircraft]] played a central role. Once-formidable fighters such as the [[P-51 Mustang]], [[F4U Corsair]], and [[Hawker Sea Fury]]<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|174}}—all [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]], propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air superiority roles to a new generation of faster, [[turbojet|jet-powered]] fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the [[P-80 Shooting Star]], [[F9F Panther]], and other jets under the UN flag dominated North Korea's prop-driven air force of Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-9]]s. The balance would shift, however, with the arrival of the [[swept wing]] Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15 Fagot]].<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|182}}<ref>Werrell, p. 71.</ref>

The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the [[Korean People's Air Force]] (KPAF) of North Korea with the MiG-15 Fagot, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|182}}<ref name="sandler_7-8">Sandler, pp. 7–8.</ref> The fast, heavily armed MiG outflew first-generation UN jets such as the American F-80 and [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian]] and British [[Gloster Meteor#Service during the Korean War|Gloster Meteors]], posing a real threat to [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombers even under fighter escort.<ref name="sandler_7-8"/> [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] pilots flew missions for the North to learn the West's aerial combat techniques. This direct Soviet participation is a ''[[casus belli]]'' that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand, as the US initially feared, to include three communist countries—North Korea, the Soviet Union, and China—and so escalate to atomic warfare.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|182}}<ref>{{cite web|last =CW2 Sewell |first =Stephen L |title = FEAF/U.N.

The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) moved quickly to counter the MiG-15, with three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the [[F-86 Sabre]], arriving in December 1950.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|183}}<ref>Werrell, pp. 76–77.</ref> Although the MiG's higher [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|service ceiling]]—{{convert|50000|ft|m|sigfig=2}} vs. {{convert|42000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}—could be advantageous at the start of a [[dogfight]], in level flight, both swept wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around {{convert|660|mi/h|km/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.acepilots.com/korea_aces.html|title=Korean War Aces: USAF F-86 Sabre jet pilots |year=2009 |work=www.acepilots.com |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> The MiG was armed with one 37&nbsp;mm and two 23&nbsp;mm cannons, while the Sabre carried six .50 caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns aimed with radar-ranged [[Gunsights#Aircraft gunsights|gunsights]].

By early 1951, the battle lines were established and changed little until 1953. In summer and autumn 1951, the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF's [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter Interceptor Wing]]—only 44 at one point—continued seeking battle in [[MiG Alley]], where the [[Yalu River]] marks the Chinese border, against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft. Following Colonel [[Harrison Thyng]]'s communication with the Pentagon, the [[51st Fighter Wing|51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; for the next year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued.<ref name="thyngcite">{{cite web|url = http://sabre-pilots.org/classics/v101thyng.htm |title = Harrison R. Thyng |publisher = Sabre Jet Classics |accessdate =2006-12-24 }}</ref>{{Clarify|date=July 2009|reason=How so—elaborate?}}

UN forces gradually gained [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] in the Korean theater. This was decisive for the UN: first, for attacking into the peninsular north, and second, for resisting the Chinese intervention.<ref name="Stokesbury1990"/>{{rp|182–184}} North Korea and China also had jet-powered air forces; their limited training and experience made it strategically untenable to lose them against the better-trained UN air forces. Thus, the US and USSR fed materiel to the war, battling by proxy and finding themselves virtually matched, technologically, when the USAF deployed the F-86F against the MiG-15 late in 1952.

After the war, and to the present day, the USAF reports an F-86 Sabre [[Loss exchange ratio|kill ratio]] in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire; .<ref>{{cite web|title = Say Hello to the bad Guy |publisher =af.mil |url =http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123010176|accessdate = 2010-10-04}}</ref>  An uncited alternative source claims only 379 Sabre kills.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively, as more recent{{When|date=July 2009}} US figures state only 230 losses out of 674 F-86s deployed to Korea.<ref>{{cite web|title = Korean War Aces, USAF F-86 Sabre jet pilots |publisher =AcePilots.com |url =http://www.acepilots.com/korea_aces.html |accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref> The differing tactical roles of the F-86 and MiG-15 may have contributed to the disparity in losses: MiG-15s primarily targeted B-29 bombers and ground-attack fighter-bombers, while F-86s targeted the MiGs.

The Korean War marked a major milestone not only for fixed-wing aircraft, but also for [[rotorcraft]], featuring the first large-scale deployment of [[helicopter]]s for [[medical evacuation]] (medevac).<ref name = "Helicopter">{{cite web|url = http://www.historynet.com/the-rise-of-the-helicopter-during-the-korean-war.htm |publisher = History Net |title = The Rise of the Helicopter During the Korean War}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher = US Army |url = http://tri.army.mil/LC/CS/csa/aahist.htm |work = Historic US Army Helicopters |title = World War II thru early Vietnam era helicopters}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> In 1944-1945, during the Second World War, the [[Sikorsky R-4|YR-4]] helicopter saw limited ambulance duty, but in Korea, where rough terrain trumped the [[jeep]] as a speedy medevac vehicle,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.olive-drab.com/od_medical_evac_helio_ww2.php |title = WW II Helicopter Evacuation |publisher = Olive Drab}}</ref> helicopters like the [[Sikorsky H-19]] helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s.<ref>Sandler, p. 9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/MASH/HE12.htm |work = Centennial of Flight |publisher = US Centennial of Flight Commission |title = M.A.S.H./Medevac Helicopters}}</ref> The limitations of jet aircraft for [[close air support]] highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to development of the [[AH-1 Cobra]] and other helicopter gunships used in the [[Vietnam War]] (1965–75).<ref name = "Helicopter" />

Because the North Korean navy was not large, the Korean War featured few naval battles; mostly the combatant navies served as naval artillery for their in-country armies. A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the US Navy cruiser [[USS Juneau (CL-119)|USS ''Juneau'']], the Royal Navy cruiser [[HMS Jamaica (44)|HMS ''Jamaica'']], and the frigate [[HMS Black Swan (L57)|HMS ''Black Swan'']] fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them.

The UN navies sank supply and ammunition ships to deny the sea to North Korea. The USS ''Juneau'' sank ammunition ships that had been present in her previous battle. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship ''PC 703'' sank a North Korean mine layer in the [[Battle of Haeju]] Island, near Inchon.

U.S. threat of atomic warfare
</heading>
<text>

On 5 April 1950, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases, if either their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there. The President ordered the transfer of nine [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]s "to the Air Force's Ninth Bomb Group, the designated carrier of the weapons ... [and] signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets", which he never transmitted.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book|last =Cumings |first =Bruce | authorlink =Bruce Cumings |title =Korea's Place in the Sun: A History |publisher =WW Norton & Company |year=1997 |pages =289–92 |isbn =0393316815 }}</ref>

President Truman did not immediately threaten [[nuclear warfare]] after the October 1950 Chinese intervention, but, 45 days later, remarked about the possibility of using it after the PVA repelled the UN Command from North Korea.

In ''The Origins of the Korean War'' (1981, 1990), US historian [[Bruce Cumings#Criticism|Bruce Cumings]] reports that in a 30 November 1950 press conference, President Truman's allusions to attacking the KPA with nuclear weapons "was a threat based on contingency planning to use the bomb, rather than the faux pas so many assumed it to be." On 30 November 1950, the USAF [[Strategic Air Command]] was ordered to "augment its capacities, and that this should include atomic capabilities."

The Indian Ambassador, [[Kavalam Madhava Panikkar|Kavalam Panikkar]], reports "that Truman announced that he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed totally unmoved by this threat ... The propaganda against American aggression was stepped up. The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities. One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in very useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities."<ref name="Schnabel" /><ref>{{Cite book|last =Knightley |first =Phillip |title =The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero, Propagandist and Myth-maker |publisher =Quartet |year=1982 | page =334 |isbn =080186951X }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last = Panikkar |first =Kavalam Madhava |authorlink =Kavalam Madhava Panikkar |title =In Two Chinas: Memoirs of a Diplomat |publisher = Hyperion Press |year=1981 |isbn =0830500138 }}</ref>

[[File:Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_(Buster-Jangle_Dog)_003.jpg|upright|thumb|Atom bomb test, 1951]]
President Truman remarked that his government was actively considering using the atomic bomb to end the war in Korea but that only he—the US President—commanded atomic bomb use, and that he had not given authorization. The matter of atomic warfare was solely a US decision, not the collective decision of the UN. Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman [[Clement Attlee]], French Premier [[René Pleven]], and Foreign Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The US's forgoing atomic warfare was not because of "a disinclination by the USSR and PRC to escalate" the Korean War, but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the US fought China, who then might persuade the USSR to conquer Western Europe.<ref name="Schnabel" /><ref>{{Cite book|last =Truman |first =Harry S |authorlink =Harry S. Truman |title =Memoirs (2 volumes) |publisher =Doubleday |date=1955–1956 |pages =vol. II, pp. 394–5 |isbn =156852062X |nopp =true }}</ref>

On 6 December 1950, after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN Command armies from northern North Korea, General [[J. Lawton Collins]] (Army Chief of Staff), General MacArthur, Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], General [[George E. Stratemeyer]], and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]], and Major General Edwin K. Wright, met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassinging the next weeks and months of warfare.<ref name="Schnabel" />

* In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command is forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without Nationalist Chinese reinforcements, and without an increase in US forces until April 1951 (four [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea.<ref name="Schnabel" />

* In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command have blockaded China and have effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the Nationalist Chinese soldiers are maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing is to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea.<ref name="Schnabel" />

* In the third scenario: if the PRC agreed to not cross the 38th parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards. The US Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan. A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice.<ref name="Schnabel" />

In 1951, the US escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because the PRC had deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, pit crews at the [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, "lacking only the essential [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] nuclear cores." In October 1951, the US effected ''Operation Hudson Harbor'' to establish nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from [[Yokota Air Base]] in east-central Japan. ''Hudson Harbor'' tested "actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming". The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the "timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare."<ref>{{Cite journal|last =Hasbrouck |first = SV |title =memo to file (November 7, 1951), G-3 Operations file, box 38-A |publisher =Library of Congress |year =1951 |postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last =Army Chief of Staff |title =memo to file (November 20, 1951), G-3 Operations file, box 38-A |publisher = Library of Congress |year =1951}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last =Watson |first =Robert J |coauthors =Schnabel, James F. |title =The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy, 1950–1951, The Korean War and 1951–1953, The Korean War (History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Volume III, Parts I and II) |publisher =Office of Joint History, Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff |year=1998 |pages =part 1, p. v; part 2, p. 614 |nopp=true }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last =Commanding General, Far East Air Force |title =Memo to 98th Bomb Wing Commander, Okinawa |year =1951}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last =Far East Command G-2 Theater Intelligence |title =Résumé of Operation, Record Group 349, box 752 |year =1951}}</ref>

To outmaneuver a possible [[fifth column]] in the Republic of Korea, President Syngman Rhee's régime assassinated its "enemies of the state"—South Koreans suspected of being communists, pro-North Korea, and leftist—by first imprisoning them for political re-education in the ''Gukmin Bodo Ryeonmaeng'' (National Rehabilitation and Guidance League, also known as the Bodo League). The true purpose of the anti–communist Bodo League, abetted by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] (USAMGIK), was the régime's assassination of some 10,000 to 100,000 "enemies of the state" whom they dumped in trenches, mines, and the sea, before and after the 25 June 1950 North Korean invasion. Contemporary calculations report some 200,000 to 1,200,000.{{Clarify|are these the numbers killed?|date=August 2010}}<ref>[http://h21.hani.co.kr/section-021003000/2001/06/021003000200106200364040.html 최소 60만명, 최대 120만명!] The Hankyoreh Plus.</ref> USAMGIK officers were present at one political execution site; at least one US officer sanctioned the mass killings of political prisoners whom the North Koreans would have freed after conquering the peninsular south.<ref name="breitbart_D94TJ7800">{{Cite news|date=December 6, 2008 |url = http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=2008-12-06_D94TJ7800|title = Children 'executed' in 1950 South Korean killings|agency = Associated Press |accessdate = 2008-12-15 |last=CHARLES J.

The South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission reports that petitions requesting explanation of the summary execution of leftist South Koreans outnumber, six-to-one, the petitions requesting explanation of the summary execution of rightist South Koreans.<ref>[http://www.jinsil.go.kr/English/index.asp South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission].</ref> These data apply solely to South Korea, because North Korea is not integral to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The father of Bodo League massacre survivor Kim Jong-chol was press-ganged to work with the KPA and later executed by the Rhee Government as a collaborator; his grandparents and a seven-year-old sister also were assassinated. About his experience in [[Namyangju]] city, he says:

USAMGIK officers photographed the mass killings at Daejon city in central South Korea, where the Truth Commission believe some 3,000 to 7,000 people were shot and buried in mass graves in early July 1950. Other declassified records report that a US Army lieutenant colonel approved the assassination of 3,500 political prisoners by the ROK Army unit to which he was military advisor when the KPA reached the southern port city of Pusan.<ref name="breitbart_D94TJ7800"/> US diplomats reported having urged the Rhee régime's restraint against its political opponents, and that the USAMGIK, who formally controlled the peninsular south, did not halt the mass assassinations.<ref name="breitbart_D94TJ7800"/>

Although the Chinese rarely executed prisoners like their Korean counterparts, mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese POW camps during the winter of 1950-51. About 43 percent of all US POWs died during this period. The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were also suffering mass starvation and diseases due to the lack of competent logistics system. The UN POWs, however, disputed the claim by pointing out that most of the Chinese camps were located near the Sino-Korean border, and that starvation was used to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrinations programs, which were running in full swing after the starvation was over.<ref>{{cite|first=Raymond B.|last=Lech|title=Broken Soldiers|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2000|location=Chicago|isbn=0252025415|page=2, 73}}</ref>

The Korean War (1950–53) was the first major proxy war in the [[Cold War]] (1945–91), the prototype of the following sphere-of-influence wars such as the [[Vietnam War]] (1959–75). The Korean War established proxy war as one way that the nuclear [[superpower]]s indirectly conducted their rivalry in third-party countries. The [[NSC-68]] Containment Policy extended the cold war from occupied Europe to the rest of the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

<text>

In addition a large number of [[Amerasian|mixed race]] ‘G.I. babies’ (offspring of U.S. and other western soldiers and Korean women) were filling up the country’s orphanages. Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of ‘race’. Children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in Korean society. Thousands [[Korean adoptee|were adopted]] by American families in the years following the war, when their plight was covered on television.<ref>Jang, J, "Adult Korean Adoptees in Search of Roots", ''Korea Herald'', 10 December 1998</ref>

The U.S. [[Immigration Act of 1952]] removed race as a limiting factor in immigration, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War. With the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1965]], which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy toward non-Europeans, [[Korean American|Koreans]] became one of the fastest growing [[Asian American|Asian]] groups in the United States.<ref>"[http://www.duke.edu/~myhan/kaf0501.html Annotated Chronology of the Korean Immigration to the United States: 1882 to 1952]"</ref>

The Korean War has been the subject of films and books, and has been depicted in other media such as theatre and photography. The TV series [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|''M*A*S*H'']] is one well known example. The 1959 novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' has twice been made into films. The 1982 film [[Inchon (film)|''Inchon'']] depicted the invasion at Inchon. Many films about the war have been produced in Asian countries as well.
