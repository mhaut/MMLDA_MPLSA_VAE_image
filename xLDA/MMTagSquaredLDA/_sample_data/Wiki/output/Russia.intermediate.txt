Etymology

<text>

{{Main|Rus (name)}}
The country's original name was Русь (Rus'), a medieval state populated mostly by the [[East Slavs]]. However, this proper name became more prominent in the later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "Русская Земля" (russkaya zemlya) which could be translated as "Russian Land" or "Land of [[Rus']]". In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as [[Kievan Rus']] by modern historiography.

An old Latin version of the name Rus' was [[Ruthenia]], mostly applied to the western and southern regions of Rus' that were adjacent to Catholic Europe. The current name of the country, Россия (Rossiya), comes from the Greek version of Rus', spelled Ρωσία [rosˈia], which was the denomination of Kievan Rus in the [[Byzantine Empire]].

The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of ''[[Varangians]]'', the [[Vikings]] who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic [[From the Varangians to the Greeks|to the Black]] [[Volga trade route|and Caspian]] Seas.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Obolensky, D.|title=Byzantium and the Slavs|publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press|year=1994|page=42|isbn=088141008X}}</ref> According to the [[Primary Chronicle]], a Varangian from [[Rus' people]], named [[Rurik]], was elected ruler of [[Novgorod]] in 862.

Oleg, Rurik's son [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] and Igor's son [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] subsequently subdued all East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the [[Khazar khaganate]] and launched several military expeditions to [[Byzantium]].

In the 10th to 11th centuries Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ukraine: Security Assistance|publisher=U.S. Department of State|url=http://www.state.gov/t/pm/64851.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> The reigns of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015) and his son [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019–1054) constitute the [[Golden Age]] of Kiev, which saw [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|the acceptance of]] [[Orthodox Christianity]] from Byzantium and the creation of the first East Slavic written [[legal code]], the ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the [[Kipchaks]] and the [[Pechenegs]], caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as [[Zalesye]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Klyuchevsky, V.|title=The course of the Russian history|volume=1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=5244000721|year=1987|publisher=Myslʹ}}</ref>

The age of [[feudalism]] and decentralization had come, marked by constant in-fighting between members of the [[Rurikid Dynasty]] that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in the north-east, [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north-west and [[Galicia-Volhynia]] in the south-west.

Ultimately Kievan Rus' disintegrated, with the final blow being the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] of 1237–40,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hamm, M.F.|title=Kiev: A Portrait, 1800–1917|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691025851|year=1995}}</ref> that resulted in the destruction of Kiev<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref> and the death of about half the population of Rus'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml|title=History of Russia from Early Slavs history and Kievan Rus to Romanovs dynasty|publisher=Parallelsixty.com|accessdate=27 Apr. 2010}}</ref> The invaders, later known as [[Tatars]], formed the state of the [[Golden Horde]], which pillaged the Russian principalities and ruled the southern and central expanses of Russia for over three centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Рыбаков, Б. А.|title=Ремесло Древней Руси|year=1948|pages=525–533, 780–781}}</ref>

Galicia-Volhynia was eventually assimilated by the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], while the Mongol-dominated Vladimir-Suzdal and Novgorod Republic, two regions on the periphery of Kiev, established the basis for the modern Russian nation.<ref name=Curtis/> The Novgorod together with [[Pskov]] retained some degree of autonomy during the time of the [[Mongol yoke]] and were largely spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country. Led by Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]], Novgorodians repelled the invading Swedes in the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240, as well as the [[Northern Crusades|Germanic crusaders]] in the [[Battle of the Ice]] in 1242, breaking their attempts to colonize the Northern Rus'.

[[File:Lissner TroiceSergievaLavr.jpg|thumb|250|[[Sergius of Radonezh]] blessing [[Dmitri Donskoi]] in [[Trinity Sergius Lavra]], before the [[Battle of Kulikovo]].]]
The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] ("Moscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in Western Russia in the early 14th century.

Those were hard times, with frequent [[Mongol-Tatar raids]] and agriculture suffering from the beginning of the [[Little Ice Age]]. Like in the rest of Europe, plagues hit Russia somewhere once every five or six years from 1350 to 1490. However, due to the lower population density and better hygiene (widespread practicing of [[banya (sauna)|banya]], the wet steam bath),<ref name=banya>[http://sauna-banya.ru/ist.html The history of banya and sauna] {{ru icon}}</ref> the population loss caused by plagues was not so severe as in the Western Europe, and the pre-Plague populations were reached in Russia as early as 1500.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=yw3HmjRvVQMC&pg=PA62 Black Death]''". Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). p.62. ISBN 0313324921</ref>

Led by Prince [[Dmitri Donskoy]] of Moscow and helped by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including the formerly strong rivals, such as [[Tver]] and [[Novgorod]]. This way Moscow became the main leading force in the process of Russia's reunification and expansion.

[[Ivan III]] (''the Great'') finally threw off the control of the Golden Horde, consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion, and was the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".<ref>{{cite web|author=May, T.|title=Khanate of the Golden Horde|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/Mongols/states3.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080607055652/http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/Mongols/states3.html|archivedate=2008-06-07|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Moscow [[Third Rome|claimed succession to the legacy]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Ivan III married [[Sophia Palaiologina]], the niece of the last [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine XI]], and made the Byzantine [[double-headed eagle]] his own, and eventually Russian, coat-of-arms.

The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5170021429}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0875690394}}</ref>

During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful [[Livonian War]] against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–908|isbn=5170021429}}</ref> At the same time the Tatars of the [[Crimean Khanate]], the only remaining successor to the [[Golden Horde]], continued to raid Southern Russia,<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves]|355&nbsp;KB}}.

[[File:Minin&Pogjarsky 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Monument to Minin and Pozharsky]] in Moscow]]
The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient [[Rurikid Dynasty]] in 1598, and in combination with the [[famine of 1601–03]]<ref>{{Cite book|author=Borisenkov E, Pasetski V.|title=The thousand-year annals of the extreme meteorological phenomena|isbn=5244002120|page=190}}</ref> led to the civil war, the rule of pretenders and foreign intervention during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the early 17th century.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=7|pages=461–568|isbn=5170021429}}</ref> [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] occupied parts of Russia, including Moscow. In 1612 the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded the throne in 1613 by the decision of [[Zemsky Sobor]], and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.

In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

[[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|left|180px|thumb|[[Peter the Great]], the first [[Emperor of Russia]]]]
Under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] (''the Great''), Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=5170021429|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}</ref> On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's ''Window to Europe''. [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia.

The reign of Peter I's daughter [[Elisabeth of Russia|Elisabeth]] in 1741–62 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years War]] (1756–63). During this conflict Russia annexed [[Eastern Prussia]] for a while and even took Berlin. However, upon Elisabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter III of Russia]].

[[Catherine II]] (''the Great''), who ruled in 1762–96, presided over the Age of [[Russian Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the south, after successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean khanate]]. As a result of victories over the Ottomans, by the early 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]]. This continued with [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I's]] (1801–25) wresting of [[Finland]] from the weakened kingdom of Sweden in 1809 and of [[Bessarabia]] from the Ottomans in 1812. At the same time Russians [[Russian America|colonized Alaska]] and even founded settlements in California, like [[Fort Ross]].

In 1803–06 the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] was made, later followed by other notable Russian sea exploration voyages. In 1820 [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|a Russian expedition]] discovered the continent of [[Antarctica]].

[[File:Imperio Ruso.PNG|thumb|300px|The [[Russian Empire]] in 1866 and its spheres of influence]]
In alliances with various European countries, Russia fought against [[Napoleon]]'s France. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Armée]] perished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering [[Paris]]. Alexander I headed Russia's delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.

The officers of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicolas I]] (1825–55) a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]]. Between 1847 and 1851 a massive wave of Asiatic [[cholera]] swept over Russia, claiming about one million lives.<ref>Geoffrey A. Hosking (2001). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=oh-5AAmboMUC&pg=PA9&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Russia and the Russians: a history]''". Harvard University Press. p.9. ISBN 0674004736</ref>

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855–81) enacted significant changes in the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These ''Great Reforms'' spurred [[industrialization]] and modernized the Russian army, which had successfully liberated [[Bulgaria]] from Ottoman rule in [[1877–78 Russo-Turkish War]].

[[File:Kustodiev The Bolshevik.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Bolshevik]]'' by [[Boris Kustodiev]], a visual representation of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]]]
The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son
[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] (1881–94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas II]] (1894–1917), was unable, however, to prevent the events of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms, including granting the [[freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]].

In 1914 Russia entered World War I in response to Austria's declaration of war on Russia's ally [[Serbia]], and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916 the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of [[Austria-Hungary]]. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], carried out in two major acts.

The [[February Revolution]] forced Nicholas II to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Ipatiev House|later executed]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. An alternative socialist establishment existed alongside, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country, instead of resolving it. Eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and created the world’s first [[socialist state]].

Following the October Revolution, a civil war broke out between the [[anti-communist]] [[White movement]] and the new regime with its [[Red Army]]. Russia lost its Ukrainian, Polish, Baltic, and Finnish territories by signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] in World War I. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-Communist forces, while both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror]]. By the end of the civil war the Russian economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged. Millions became [[White émigré]]s,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA3 Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]. James E. Hassell (1991). p.3.

The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (called ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic'' at the time) together with three other Soviet republics [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|formed the Soviet Union]], or USSR, on 30 December 1922. Out of the 15 [[republics of the USSR]], the Russian SFSR was the largest in terms of size, and making up over half of the total USSR population, dominated the union for its entire 69-year history.

Following Lenin's death in 1924, [[Joseph Stalin]], an elected [[General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to put down all opposition groups within the party and consolidate much power in his hands. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of the [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[socialism in one country]] became the primary line. The continued internal struggle in the [[Bolshevik party]] culminated in the [[Great Purge]], a period of mass repressions in 1937–38, in which hundreds of thousands of people were executed, including military leaders convicted in [[coup d'état]] plots.<ref>Abbott Gleason (2009).

The government launched a [[planned economy]], [[industrialisation]] of the largely rural country, and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] of its agriculture. During this period of rapid economical and social changes, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labor camps]],<ref name="Getty">Getty, Rittersporn, Zemskov.

Davies]], [[S.G. Wheatcroft]] (2004). ''The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931–33''. pp. 401</ref> However, though with a heavy price, the Soviet Union was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time.

The [[Appeasement policy]] of Great Britain and France towards [[Adolf Hitler]]'s annexations of [[Ruhr]], Austria and finally of [[Czechoslovakia]] enlarged the might of [[Nazi Germany]] and put a threat of war to the Soviet Union. Around the same time the [[German Reich]] allied with the [[Empire of Japan]], a rival of the USSR in the [[Far East]] and an open enemy in the [[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars]] in 1938–39.

[[File:VE-day-parade-moscow.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945]] was the first major Soviet event recorded on color film.]]
In August 1939, after another failure of attempts to establish a counter-Nazism alliance with Britain and France, the Soviet government agreed to conclude the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, pledging non-aggression between the two countries and dividing their spheres of influence in [[Eastern Europe]]. While Hitler conquered Poland, France and other countries acting on single front at the start of the [[World War II]], the USSR was able to build up its military and regain some of the former territories of the [[Russian Empire]] during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] and the [[Winter War]].

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany broke the non-aggression treaty and invaded the Soviet Union with the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history,<ref>{{cite web|title=World War II|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 Mar. 2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648813/World-War-II}}</ref> opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest theater of the Second World War]]. Although the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] had considerable success early on, their onslaught was halted in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Subsequently the Germans were dealt major defeats first at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942–43,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648813/World-War-II|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=12 Mar. 2008|title=The Allies' first decisive successes: Stalingrad and the German retreat, summer 1942–February 1943}}</ref> and then in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the summer of 1943. Another German failure was the [[Siege of Leningrad]], in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941–44 by German and Finnish forces, suffering starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendering.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521863260 The Legacy of the Siege of Leningrad, 1941–1995]. Cambridge University Press.</ref> Under Stalin's administration and the leadership of such commanders as [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]], Soviet forces drove through [[Eastern Europe]] in 1944–45 and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in May 1945. In August 1945 the Soviet Army [[Soviet-Japanese War (1945)|ousted Japanese]] from China's [[Manchukuo]] and [[North Korea]], contributing to the allied victory over Japan.

The 1941–1945 period of World War II is known in Russia as the ''[[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]''. In this conflict, which included many of the [[most lethal battle operations]] in human history, Soviet military and civilian deaths were 10.6&nbsp;million and 15.9&nbsp;million respectively,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Erlikman, V.|title=Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik|year=2004|id=Note: Estimates for Soviet World War II casualties vary between sources|isbn=5931651071|publisher=Russkai︠a︡ panorama|location=Moskva}}</ref> accounting for about a third of all [[World War II casualties]]. The Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation<ref>{{cite web|title=Reconstruction and Cold War|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/12.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> but the Soviet Union emerged as an acknowledged [[superpower]].

The [[Red Army]] occupied [[Eastern Europe]] after the war, including [[East Germany]]. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union exported its [[Communist ideology]] to newly formed [[People's Republic of China]] and [[North Korea]], and later into [[Cuba]] and many other countries. Significant amounts of the Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.</ref>

After Stalin's death and a short period of collective rule, new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced the [[cult of personality]] of Stalin and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. Penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=1 Aug. 2008|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag|date=5 Jun. 1978}}</ref> The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khruschev thaw]]. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the U.S. [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in [[Turkey]] and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].

[[File:Mir on 12 June 1998edit1.jpg|left|thumb|Soviet and Russian [[space station]] [[Mir]]]]
In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the [[Earth]] aboard ''[[Vostok 1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].

Following the ousting of voluntarist and erratic Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of 1970s and the early 1980s was designated later as [[Brezhnev stagnation]], a period when the economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The [[Kosygin reform]], aimed into partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifting the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]], was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.

In 1979 the Soviet forces entered [[Afghanistan]] at the request of its communist government. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately the [[Soviet Army]] was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 because of international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerilla warfare (enhanced by the U.S.), and a lack of support from Soviet citizens.

From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize the country and make it more [[democratic]]. However, this led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Prior to 1991, the [[Soviet economy]] was the second largest in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=9 Mar. 2008|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}</ref> but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in money supply leading to inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/russia/economy/russia_economy_unforeseen_results_o~1315.html|title=Russia Unforeseen Results of Reform|publisher=The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook|accessdate=10 Mar. 2008}}</ref>

In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|an unsuccessful military coup]], directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to its collapse and the end of socialist rule. The USSR [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|was dissolved]] into 15 [[post-Soviet states]] in December 1991.

The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[Northern Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. Since the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists had declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] was fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. Terrorist attacks against civilians carried out by separatists, most notably the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and [[Beslan school siege]], caused hundreds of deaths and drew worldwide attention.

Russia took up the responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia pays off USSR’s entire debt, sets to become crediting country|publisher=Pravda.ru|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/22-08-2006/84038-paris-club-0|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> High budget deficits caused the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/aslund0108.pdf|title=Russia's Capitalist Revolution|author=Aslund A|accessdate=28 Mar. 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> and resulted in further GDP decline.<ref name=OECD>{{cite web|title=Russian Federation|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/50/2452793.pdf|accessdate=24 Feb. 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

According to the [[Constitution of Russia]], the country is a [[federation]] and [[semi-presidential]] [[republic]], wherein the President is the [[head of state]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 80, §1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[representative democracy]], with the federal government composed of three branches:
* [[Legislative]]: The [[bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]], made up of the 450-member [[State Duma]] and the 176-member [[Federation Council]], adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]] and the power of [[impeachment]] of the President.
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The President is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto [[legislative bill]]s before they become law, and appoints the Cabinet and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]], [[Supreme Court of Arbitration]] and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the President, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term (eligible for a second term, but not for a third consecutive term).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 81, §3)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> Ministries of the government are composed of the Premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma). Leading political parties in Russia include [[United Russia]], the [[CPRF|Communist Party]], the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], and [[Fair Russia]].

Western observers have raised questions as to how much of Russia's political system corresponds to Western liberal democratic ideals. Academics have often complained about the difficulty of classifying Russia's political system. According Steve White, during the Putin presidency Russia made clear that it had no intention of establishing a "second edition" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Stephen|editor1-first=Stephen|editor1-last=White|title=Developments in Russian Politics 7|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|location=New York|language=English|isbn=9780230224490|chapter=Classifying Russia's Politics}}</ref> [[Richard Sakwa]] wrote that the Russian government is undoubtedly considered legitimate by the great majority of the Russian people and seeks to deliver a set of public goods without appealing to extra-democratic logic to achieve them, but whether the system was becoming an illiberal or delegative democracy was more contentious.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sakwa|first1=Richard|editor1-first=Stephen|editor1-last=White|title=Developments in Russian Politics 7|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|location=New York|language=English|isbn=9780230224490|chapter=Politics in Russia}}</ref>

As the successor to a former superpower, Russia's geopolitical status has been often debated, particularly in relation to [[Polarity in international relations|unipolar and multipolar]] views on the global political system. While Russia is commonly accepted to be a [[great power]], in recent years it has been characterized by a number of world leaders,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/11/world/fg-russia-chavez11 Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez recognizes independence of breakaway Georgia republics] by Megan K.

An important aspect of Russia's relations with [[the West]] is the criticism of Russia's political system and human rights management by the Western governments, the mass media and the leading democracy and human rights watchdogs. In particular, such organisations as the [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] consider Russia to have not enough democratic attributes and to allow few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/russia/report-2009|title=Amnesty International report on Russia|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Human Rights Watch on Russia and Chechnya [http://www.hrw.org/en/video/2008/04/06/russia-trial HTW.org]</ref> US-funded international organization [[Freedom House]] ranks Russia as "not free", citing "carefully engineered elections" and "absence" of debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2009&country=7689|title=Annual report Russia|publisher=Freedom House|date=10 May 2004|accessdate=27 Apr. 2010}}</ref> Russian authorities dismiss these claims and especially criticise [[Freedom House]]. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia]] has called the 2006 [[Freedom in the World (report)|Freedom in the World Report]] "prefabricated", stating that the human rights issues have been turned into a political weapon in particular by the [[U. S.]] The ministry also claims that such organizations as Freedom House and Human Rights Watch use the same scheme of voluntary extrapolation of ''"isolated facts that of course can be found in any country"'' into ''"dominant tendencies"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/21jun2006/fh.html|title=In Russian: МИД России назвал доклад Freedom House "дубиной" в руках Вашингтона|publisher=Newsru.com|accessdate=27 Apr. 2010}}</ref>

As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia plays a major role in maintaining international peace and security. The country participates in the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] and the [[Six-party talks]] with [[North Korea]]. Russia is a member of the [[Group of Eight]] (G8) industrialized nations, the [[Council of Europe]], [[OSCE]] and [[APEC]]. Russia usually takes a leading role in regional organizations such as the [[CIS]], [[EurAsEC]], [[CSTO]], and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]].<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/sco.htm The Shanghai Cooperation Organization] at Globalsecurity.org April 27, 2005</ref> Former President Vladimir Putin had advocated a strategic partnership with close integration in various dimensions including establishment of [[EU-Russia Common Spaces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rian.ru/politics/20041125/743119.html|title=Interview of official Ambassador of Russian Foreign Ministry on relations with the EU|publisher=RIA Novosti|accessdate=30 Jun. 2008}} {{ru_icon}}</ref> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has developed a friendlier, albeit volatile [[NATO-Russia relations|relationship]] with [[NATO]].

Russia maintains strong and positive relations with other [[BRIC countries]]. In recent years, the country has sought to strengthen ties especially with the [[People's Republic of China]] by signing the [[Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation|Treaty of Friendship]] as well as building the [[Trans-Siberian oil pipeline]] geared toward growing Chinese energy needs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704082104575515543164948682.html|title=Russian Oil Route Will Open to China|first=Jeremy|last=Page|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2010-09-26|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref>

{{Main|Subdivisions of Russia}}
[[File:Russian-regions.png|thumb|centre|600px|Map of the [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] of the Russian Federation.]]
;Federal subjects
The Russian Federation comprises 83&nbsp;[[federal subjects]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 65, §1) In 1993, when the Constitution was adopted, there were 89&nbsp;subjects listed. Some of them were later [[federal subjects of Russia#Mergers|merged]]|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-04.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> These subjects have equal representation—two delegates each—in the [[Federation Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 95, §2)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-06.htm|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> However, they differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.
* 46 [[oblasts of Russia|oblasts]] (provinces): most common type of federal subjects, with federally appointed governor and locally elected legislature.
* 21 [[republics of Russia|republics]]: nominally autonomous; each has its own constitution, president, and parliament. Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs. Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.
* 9 [[krais of Russia|krais]] (territories): essentially the same as oblasts. The "territory" designation is historic, originally given to frontier regions and later also to administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts.
* 4 [[autonomous okrugs of Russia|autonomous okrugs]] (autonomous districts): originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities, their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s. With the exception of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part.
* 1 [[autonomous oblast]] (the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]): originally autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais. In 1990, all of them except the Jewish AO were elevated in status to that of a republic.
* 2 [[federal cities]] (Moscow and St. Petersburg): major cities that function as separate regions.

;Federal districts
Federal subjects are grouped into 8 [[federal districts]], each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia.<ref>''Russian Classificaton of Economic Regions'' (OK&nbsp;024–95) of 1 January 1997 as amended by the Amendments #1/1998 through #5/2001. Section&nbsp;I. Federal Districts)</ref> Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.

The enormous size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southeast. Mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the [[Indian Ocean]], while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.<ref name=congress>{{cite web|title=Climate|publisher=Library Of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|accessdate=26 Dec. 2007}}</ref>

Most of Northern European Russia and [[Siberia]] has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the [[Sakha Republic]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|−68|°C|°F|1|disp=s}}), and more moderate elsewhere. The strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean, as well as the [[Russian Arctic islands]], have a [[polar climate]].

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the [[Black Sea]], most notably in [[Sochi]], possesses a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters. Winter is dry compared to summer in many regions of East Siberia and the Far East, while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as [[snow]]. The region along the Lower [[Volga]] and [[Caspian Sea]] coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a [[semi-arid climate]].

Russia has a [[market economy]] with enormous natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas. It has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|10th largest]] economy in the world by nominal GDP and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|6th largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP). Since the turn of the 21st century, higher domestic consumption and greater political stability have bolstered economic growth in Russia.

[[List of countries by waterways length|102,000 km of inland waterways]] in Russia mostly go by natural rivers or lakes. In the European part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers. Russia's capital, Moscow, is sometimes called ''"the port of the five seas"'', due to its waterway connections to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[White Sea|White]], [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], [[Azov Sea|Azov]] and [[Black Sea]]s.

Major sea ports of Russia include [[Rostov-on-Don]] on the Azov Sea, [[Novorossiysk]] on the Black Sea, [[Astrakhan]] and [[Makhachkala]] on the Caspian, [[Kaliningrad]] and [[St Petersburg]] on the Baltic, [[Arkhangelsk]] on the White Sea, [[Murmansk]] on the Barents Sea, [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] and [[Vladivostok]] on the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 the country owned [[Merchant marine by country|1448 merchant marine]] ships.

{{Main|Science and technology in Russia|Russian scientists|Russian inventors|Russian inventions}}
Science and technology in Russia blossomed since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when [[Peter the Great]] founded the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]], and [[polymath]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] established the [[Moscow State University]], paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation. In the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of [[Russian scientists|notable scientists]] and [[Russian inventors|inventors]].

[[File:Lomonosovportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikhail Lomonosov]], [[polymath]] scientist, inventor, poet and artist]]
The [[Russian physics school]] began with Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the [[energy conservation law]]. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the [[electric arc]], electrodynamical [[Lenz's law]], [[space groups]] of [[crystal]]s, [[photoelectric cell]], [[Cherenkov radiation]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]], [[heterotransistor]]s and [[3D holography]]. [[Laser]]s and [[maser]]s were co-invented by [[Nikolai Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]], while the idea of [[tokamak]] for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] was introduced by [[Igor Tamm]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]], leading eventually the modern international [[ITER]] project, where Russia is a party.

Since the time of [[Nikolay Lobachevsky]] (a ''[[Copernicus]] of [[Geometry]]'' who pioneered the [[non-Euclidean geometry]]) and a prominent tutor [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], the [[Russian mathematical school]] became one of the most influential in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20therenkoh Century|publisher=Princeton University, USA|url=http://www.worldscibooks.com/mathematics/4499.html|accessdate=10 Apr. 2010}}</ref> Chebyshev's students included  [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], who founded the modern [[stability theory]], and [[Andrey Markov]] who invented the [[Markov chain]]s. In the 20th century Soviet mathematicians, such as [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Sergey Sobolev]], made major contributions to various areas of mathematics. Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with [[Fields Medal]], a most prestigious award in mathematics. Recently [[Grigori Perelman]] was offered the first ever Clay [[Millennium Prize Problems]] Award for his final proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Poincaré Conjecture|url=http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html}}</ref>

[[Russian chemist]] [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] invented the [[Periodic table]], the main framework of modern [[chemistry]]. [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] was one of the creators of the theory of [[chemical structure]], playing a central role in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Russian biologists]] include [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] who discovered [[virus]]es, [[Ivan Pavlov]] who was the first to experiment with the [[classical conditioning]], and [[Ilya Mechnikov]] who was a pioneer researcher of the [[immune system]] and [[probiotics]].

Many Russian scientists and inventors were [[émigrés]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]], who built the first [[airliner]]s and modern-type  helicopters; [[Vladimir Zworykin]], often called the father of [[TV]]; chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], noted for his work on [[dissipative structures]] and [[complex systems]]; [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economists [[Simon Kuznets]] and  [[Wassily Leontief]]; physicist [[Georgiy Gamov]] (an author of the [[Big Bang]] theory) and social scientist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]].

[[File:Soyuz TMA-2 launch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|220px|Soyuz TMA-2 launch.jpg|[[Soyuz TMA-2]] is launched from [[Baikonur]], [[Kazakhstan]] carrying one of the first resident crews to the [[International Space Station]].]]
[[Russian inventions]] include the [[arc welding]] by [[Nikolay Benardos]], further developed by [[Nikolay Slavyanov]], [[Konstantin Khrenov]] and other Russian engineers. [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the [[knapsack parachute]], while [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] introduced the [[pressure suit]]. [[Alexander Lodygin]] and [[Pavel Yablochkov]] were pioneers of [[electric lighting]], and [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] introduced the first [[three-phase electric power]] systems, widely used today. [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev|Sergei Lebedev]] invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of [[synthetic rubber]]. The first [[ternary computer]], ''[[Setun]]'', was developed by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]],

Russian achievements in the field of [[space technology]] and [[space exploration]] are traced back to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]],  the father of theoretical austronautics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm|title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|publisher=Aiaa.org|accessdate=2 Jan. 2010}}</ref> His works had inspired leading [[Soviet]] rocket engineers, such as [[Sergey Korolyov]], [[Valentin Glushko]] and many others who contributed to the success of the [[Soviet space program]] on early stages of the [[Space Race]] and beyond. In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', was launched; in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by [[Yury Gagarin]]; and many other Soviet and Russian [[space exploration records]] ensued, including the first [[spacewalk]] performed by [[Alexey Leonov]], the first [[space exploration rover]] ''[[Lunokhod-1]]'' and the first [[space station]] ''[[Salyut 1]]''. Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html|title=Russian space program in 2009: plans and reality|publisher=Russianspaceweb.com|accessdate=27 Apr. 2010}}</ref> and the only provider of transport for [[space tourism]] services.

In the 20th century a number of prominent [[Soviet aerospace engineers]], inspired by the fundamental works of [[Nikolai Zhukovsky]],  [[Sergei Chaplygin]] and others, designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russian [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. Famous Russian aircrafts include the civilian [[Tupolev|Tu]]-series, [[Sukhoi|Su]] and [[MiG|MiG fighter aircraft]]s, [[Kamov|Ka]] and [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mi]]-series helicopters; many Russian aircraft models are on the [[list of most produced aircraft]] in history.

Famous Russian battle tanks include [[T-34]], the best tank design of World War II,<ref>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/t34.htm Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)] by George Parada (n.d.) ''Achtung Panzer!'' website, retrieved on 17 November 2008</ref> and further tanks of T-series, including the most produced tank in history, [[T-54/55]].<ref>Halberstadt, Hans Inside the Great Tanks The Crowood Press Ltd. Wiltshire, England 1997 94–96 ISBN 1-86126-270-1: "The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history."</ref> The [[AK-47]] and [[AK-74]] by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] constitute the most widely used type of [[assault rifle]] throughout the world—so much so that more AK-type rifles have been manufactured than all other assault rifles combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weaponomics: The Economics of Small Arms|url=http://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/workingpapers/pdfs/2006-13text.pdf}}</ref>

With all these achievements, however, since the late Soviet era Russia was lagging behind [[the West]] in a number of technologies, mostly those related to [[energy conservation]] and [[consumer goods]] production. The crisis of 1990-s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a [[brain drain]] migration from Russia.

In 2000-s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government [[Medvedev modernisation programme|launched a campaign]] aimed into [[modernisation]] and [[innovation]]. Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] formulated top 5 priorities for the country's technological development: [[efficient energy use]], IT (including both common products and the products combined with [[space technology]]), [[nuclear energy]] and [[pharmaceuticals]].<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091011/156428675.html Medvedev outlines priorities for Russian economy's modernization] RIA Novosti</ref> Currently Russia is completing [[GLONASS]] (the only global [[satellite navigation system]] apart from American [[GPS]]), as well as developing its own [[Sukhoi PAK FA|fifth-generation jet fighter]] and constructing the first serial [[mobile nuclear plant]].

There are over 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples in Russia.<ref name=ethnicgroups/> Ethnic [[Russians]] with their [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] with their Turkic [[Muslim]] culture, [[Buddhist]] [[nomadic]] [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]], [[Shamanistic]] peoples of the [[Extreme North]] and [[Siberia]], highlanders of the [[Northern Caucasus]], [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Russian North West]] and [[Volga Region]] all contribute to the cultural diversity of the country.

[[Handicraft]], like [[Dymkovo toy]], [[khokhloma]], [[gzhel]] and [[palekh miniature]] represent an important aspect of Russian folk culture. Ethnic Russian clothes include [[kaftan]], [[kosovorotka]] and [[ushanka]] for men, [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]] for women, with [[lapti]] and [[valenki]] as common shoes. The clothes of [[Cossack]]s from Southern Russia include [[Burka (Caucasus)|burka]] and [[papaha]], which they share with the peoples of the Northern Caucasus.

[[Russian cuisine]] widely uses [[fish]], [[poultry]], [[mushrooms]], [[berries]], and [[honey]]. Crops of [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for various [[bread]]s, [[pancake]]s and [[cereal]]s, as well as for [[kvass]], [[beer]] and [[vodka]] drinks. [[Black bread]] is rather popular in Russia, compared to the rest of the world. Flavourful soups and stews include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. [[Pirozhki]], [[blini]] and [[syrniki]] are native types of pancakes. [[Chicken Kiev]], [[pelmeni]] and [[shashlyk]] are popular meat dishes, the last two being of Tatar and Caucasus origin respectively. Salads include [[Russian salad]], [[vinaigrette]] and [[Dressed Herring]].

Russia's large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions of [[Music of Russia#Ethnic roots music|folk music]]. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are [[gusli]], [[balalaika]], [[zhaleika]] and [[garmoshka]]. Folk music had great influence on Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, including [[Melnitsa]]. [[Russian folk songs]], as well as [[patriotic]] [[Soviet songs]], constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renown [[Red Army choir]] and other popular ensembles.

Russians have [[Russian traditions|many traditions]], including the washing in [[banya (sauna)|banya]], a hot steam bath somewhat similar to [[sauna]].<ref name="banya"/> Old [[Russian folklore]] takes its roots in the pagan [[Slavic religion]].

Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], made a number of well-known poetical interpretations of the classical fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems of great popularity.

{{Main|Russian architecture|Russian architects}}
[[File:RedSquare SaintBasile (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Moscow]], the masterpiece of [[Russian architecture]]]]
Since [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] for several ages Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox churches]] with their many [[dome]]s, often gilded or brightly painted.

[[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia since the late 15th century, while the 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es<ref>[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church an the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}</ref> culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed.<ref>[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky1.htm The shapes of domes of ancient Russian churches] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at the site of RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}</ref> In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the [[Western Europe]].

The 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].

In 1955 a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khruschev]], condemned the "excesses" of the former academic architecture,<ref>Russian: Постановление ЦК КПСС и СМ СССР "Об устранении излишеств в проектировании и строительстве", 04.11.1955 (Khruschev's decree ''On liquidation of excesses ...'') {{ru icon}}</ref> and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain [[functionalism in architecture]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles. The situation improved in the recent two decades. Many temples demolished in Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in World War II. A total of 23,000 Orthodox churches have been rebuilt between 1991-2010, which effectively quadrapled the number of operating churches in Russia.<ref>[http://www.en.rian.ru/art_living/20101203/161616486.html Over 20,000 churches rebuilt in Russia in 20 years - Patriarch Kirill] [[RIA Novosti]]</ref>

Early Russian painting is represented in [[Russian icons|icons]] and vibrant [[fresco]]s, the two genres inherited from [[Byzantium]]. As Moscow rose to power, [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Dionisius]] and [[Andrei Rublev]] became vital names associated with a distinctly Russian art.

The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757<ref>[http://en.rah.ru/content/en/section-academy-en.html Russian Academy of Arts] official site.</ref> and gave Russian artists an international role and status. [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]] and other 18th century academicians mostly focused on [[portrait painting]]. In the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, mythological and Biblical themes inspired many prominent painings, notably by [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].

In the mid-19th century the ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''Wanderers'') group of artists broke with the Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from academic restrictions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Camilla|title=Russian Experiment in Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|year=2002|page=9}}</ref> These were mostly [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painters who captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and [[birch]] clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Some artists focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history, while others turned to [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].  Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Ilya Repin]] and [[Boris Kustodiev]].

The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of [[symbolism (art)|symbolist]] painting, represented by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]].

The [[Russian avant-garde]] was a large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].

[[Soviet]] art produced works that were furiously [[patriotic]] and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country. Soviet artists often combined innovation with socialist realism, notably the sculptors [[Vera Mukhina]], [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]] and [[Ernst Neizvestny]].

Modern [[Russian rock]] music takes its roots both in the Western [[rock and roll]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and in traditions of the [[Russian bards]] of the Soviet era, like [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]].<ref>[http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/music/380/#r1 History of Rock Music in Russia] at Russia-InfoCentre</ref> Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Kipelov]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]] and [[Korol i Shut]].

[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|upright|thumb|180px|[[Leo Tolstoy]], novelist and philosopher.]]
[[Russian literature]] is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, contributing many of the world's most famous literary works. In the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]], and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period, known also as the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]], began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], who is considered the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the ''"Russian Shakespeare"''.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=0192801449|year=2001}}</ref> It continued into the 19th century with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] in particular were titanic figures to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=11 Apr. 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html|accessdate=10 Apr. 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich|date=6 Sep. 1971}}</ref>

By the 1880s the age of the great novelists was over, while short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres. The next several decades became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]], when the previously dominant [[literary realism]] was replaced by [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Leading authors of this era include poets [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]], and novelists [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].

[[Russian philosophy]] blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].

Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] many prominent writers and philosophers left the country, including [[Ivan Bunin]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[Nikolay Berdyayev]], while a new generation of talented authors joined together in an effort to create a distinctive working-class culture appropriate for the new Soviet state. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]]. Since late 1950s the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring the official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era include novelists [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], and poets [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

Russian and later [[Soviet cinema]] was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917, resulting in world-renown films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' by [[Sergei Eisenstein]].<ref name=film>{{cite web|title=Russia:Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> Eisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who developed the [[Soviet montage theory]] of film editing at the world's first film school, the [[All-Union Institute of Cinematography]]. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' (“film-eye”) theory—that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life—had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. The subsequent state policy of [[socialist realism]] somewhat limited creativity, however many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, like ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.<ref name=film/>

1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in the Soviet cinema. [[Eldar Ryazanov]]'s and [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961–68 [[Sergey Bondarchuk]] directed an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[War and Peace (1968 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s epic ''[[War and Peace]]'', which was [[the most expensive film]] ever made.<ref>[http://www.filmforum.org/films/warandpeace.html Sergei Bondarchuk's ''War and peace''], at filmforum.org</ref> In 1969, [[Vladimir Motyl]]'s ''[[White Sun of the Desert]]'' was released, a very popular film in a genre of [[ostern]]; the film is traditionally watched by [[cosmonauts]] before any trip into space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/wrt/onsale08/russian08/whitesunofthedesert.html|publisher=Film Society of Lincoln Center|title=White Sun of the Desert|accessdate=18 Jan. 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Shukhov tower shabolovka moscow 02.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[Shukhov Tower]] in Moscow served for the early radio and TV broadcasting]]
[[Russian animation]] dates back to the late [[Russian Empire]] times. During Soviet era, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including [[Ivan Ivanov-Vano]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]] and [[Aleksandr Tatarsky]]. Many Soviet cartoon heroes, such as the Russian-style [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], cute little [[Cheburashka]], Wolf and Hare from ''[[Nu, Pogodi!]]'' are iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries.

The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economic revival. Production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dzieciolowski, Z|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|accessdate=27 Dec. 2007}}</ref> Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565&nbsp;million, up 37% from the previous year<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment & Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=joomag magazine|url=http://magazine.joomag.com/Russia/4228/p44|accessdate=03 Oct. 2010}}</ref> In 2002 the ''[[Russian Ark]]'' became the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take. The traditions of Soviet animation were developed recently by such directors as [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]] and studios like [[Melnitsa Animation]].

Russia was among the first countries to [[Radio Day|introduce radio]] [[Timeline of the introduction of television|and television]]. While there were few channels in the Soviet time, in the past two decades many new state and private-owned [[Russian language radio stations|radio stations]] and [[TV in Russia|TV channels]] appeared.

Along with ice hockey and basketball, [[association football]] is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. The Soviet national team became the first ever European Champions by winning [[Euro 1960]]. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] and [[Zenit St Petersburg]] won the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008 respectively. The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to the eventual champions Spain. Russia will host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], with 14 host cities located in the European part of the country and on the Urals.

[[File:Victory Day Parade 2005-18.jpg|220px|thumb|left|2005 [[Victory Day (9 May)]] parade on Moscow's [[Red Square]].]]
There are seven [[public holidays in Russia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sras.org/russian_holidays|title=Official days off for public holidays in Russia |publisher=Sras.org|accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref> except those always celebrated on Sunday. The New Year is the first in calendar and in popularity. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on 7 January, because [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]] and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are [[Easter]] and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian [[Muslim]]s.

Further Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (9 May)]]; [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.

[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] is the second popular holiday in Russia, it commemorates the victory over [[Nazism]] in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organized in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades took place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.

Popular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (New Year according to Julian Calendar on 14 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (an old pagan spring holidaya week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (a day of [[Yury Gagarin]]'s first ever human trip into space on 12 April), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pagan Slavic holiday on 7 July) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of [[Valentine's Day]], which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity).

[[File:Alyye parusa.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration on the [[Neva]] river in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]
State symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and became widely used since [[Russian Empire]] times. [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.

[[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is a [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is a [[national tree]]. [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and [[national personification]] of Russia, though this image has Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it fairly recently. The native Russian national personification is [[Mother Russia]], sometimes called Mother Motherland.

Tourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the [[most visited countries]] in the world. Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the [[Golden Ring]] of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].

Most visited destinations in Russia are Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the current and the former capitals of the country. Recognized as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renown museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays the [[Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[MIBC|modern scyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|and bridges]].

[[File:Russian-Matroshka2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]
[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].

Typical Russian souvenirs include [[matryoshka doll]] and other [[handicraft]], [[samovar]]s for water heating, [[ushanka]] and [[papaha]] warm hats, and fur clothes. Russian [[vodka]] and [[caviar]] are among the food that attracts foreigners.

The warm subtropical [[Black Sea]] coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts, including [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world,<ref name=baikal/> has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tyva]].
