'''Athletics''' is a collection of [[sport]]ing events that involve competitive [[running]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], and [[walking]]. The most common types of athletics competitions are [[track and field]], [[road running]], [[cross country running]], and [[race walking]]. The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most commonly competed sports in the world.

Organised athletics are traced back to the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] from 776 BC, and most modern events are conducted by the member clubs of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]].  The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the modern [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]], and other leading international meetings include the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|IAAF World Championships]] and [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics|World Indoor Championships]].

==Etymology==
The word athletics is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "''athlos''", meaning "contest". Initially, the term was used to describe [[athletic contest]]s in general – i.e. sporting competition based primarily on human physical feats. In the 19th century in [[Europe]], the term athletics acquired a more narrow definition and came to describe sports involving competitive running, walking, jumping and throwing. This definition continues to be the most prominent one in the United Kingdom and most of the areas of the former [[British Empire]]. Furthermore, foreign words in many [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages]] which are related to the term athletics also have a similar meaning.

In contrast to this, in much of [[North America]] athletics is synonymous with [[athletic sports]] in general, maintaining a more historic usage of the term. The word "athletics" is rarely used to refer to the sport of athletics in this region.

The [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]], a sports festival which emerged in 17th century [[England]], also featured athletics in the form of [[sledgehammer]] throwing contests.<ref>[http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862 Origins of Robert Dover's Games ].

The earliest recorded meeting was organised at [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]] in 1840 by the Royal [[Shrewsbury School]] Hunt. There are details of the meeting in a series of letters written 60 years later by C.T. Robinson, who was a pupil there from 1838 to 1841.  The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich held an organised competition in 1849, but the first regular series of meetings was held by [[Exeter College, Oxford]] from 1850.<ref>Oxford Companion to Sports and Games, ed.

[[Amateur Athletic Association]] (AAA) was established in England in 1880 as the first national body for the sport of athletics and began holding its own annual athletics competition – the [[AAA Championships]]. The [[United States]] also began holding an annual national competition – the [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]] – first held in 1876 by the [[New York Athletic Club]].<ref name=Champs>[http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/display_article.php?id=258 The United States' National Championships In Track & Field Athletics: Introduction]. ''[[Track and Field News]]''. Retrieved on 2009-09-19.</ref> Athletics became codified and standardised via the English AAA and other general sports organisations in the late 19th century, such as the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (founded in the US in 1888) and the [[Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques]] (founded in France in 1889).

An athletics competition was included in the first modern [[Olympic Games]] in 1896 and it has been as one of the foremost competitions at the quadrennial [[multi-sport event]] ever since. Originally for men only, the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]] saw the introduction of women's events in the athletics programme. The sport has a very high profile during major championships, especially the Olympics, but otherwise is less popular.

An international governing body, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), was founded in 1912; it adopted its current name, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], in 2001. The IAAF established separate outdoor [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in 1983. In modern times, athletes can receive money for racing, putting an end to the so-called "[[amateurism]]" that existed before.

==Sports==
{{see also|List of athletics events}}
Athletics competitions are typically divided into one of four categories: [[track and field]], [[road running]], [[cross country running]], and [[race walking]]. All forms of athletics are [[individual sports]] with the exception of [[relay race]]s. However, athletes' performances are often tallied together by country at international championships, and in the case of cross country the finishing times of the top athletes from each team or country are combined to declare a team victor.

===Track and field===
{{main|Track and field}}
[[File:Track and field stadium.jpg|thumb|A typical track and field stadium with an oval running track and a grassy inner field]]
Track and field competitions emerged in the late 19th century and were typically contested between athletes who were representing rival [[educational institution]]s, [[military organisation]]s and [[sports club]]s.<ref name=IAAFintro>[http://www.iaaf.org/aboutiaaf/history/index.html History – Introduction]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 25 March 2010.</ref> Participating athletes may compete in one or more events, according to their specialities. Men and women compete separately. Track and field comes in both indoor and outdoor formats, with most indoor competitions occurring in [[winter]], while outdoor events are held in [[Spring (season)|spring]] and [[summer]]. The sport is defined by the venue in which the competitions are held – the [[track and field stadium]].

A variety of [[running]] events are held on the track and these fall into three broad distance types: [[sprint (running)|sprints]], [[middle distance track event|middle-distance]], and [[long-distance track event]]s. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a [[baton (running)|baton]] to their team-mate after a specified distance with the aim of being the first team to finish. [[Hurdling]] events and the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] are a variation upon the flat running theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types – jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl an implement, with the most common events being the [[shot put]], [[discus throw|discus]], [[javelin throw|javelin]], and [[hammer throw]]. There are four common track and field jumping events: the [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]] are contests measuring the distance an athlete can jump, while the [[high jump]] and [[pole vault]] are decided on the height achieved. [[Combined events]], such as the [[decathlon]], are competitions where athletes compete in a number of different track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.

The most prestigious track and field contests occur within athletics championships and athletics programmes at [[multi-sport events]]. The [[World Championships in Athletics]] and [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics competition]] are the highest levels of competition in track and field, followed by regional athletics championships and Games. Track and field events have become the most prominent part of major athletics championships and many famous athletes within the sport of athletics come from this discipline. Discrete track and field competitions are found at [[national championships]]-level and also at annual, invitational [[track and field meeting]]s. Meetings range from elite competitions – such as those in the [[IAAF Diamond League]] series – to basic [[all-comers track meet]]s and inter-sports club meetings, which form the grassroots of track and field.

===Road running===
{{Main|Road running}}

Road running competitions are running events which are primarily conducted on courses of [[Road surface|paved]] or [[tarmac]] [[road]]s, although major events often finish on the track of a main [[stadium]]. In addition to being a common [[recreational sport]], the elite level of the sport – particularly [[marathon race]]s – are one of the more popular aspects of athletics. The marathon is the only road running event featured at the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]] and the [[Summer Olympics]], although there is also an annual [[IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]]. The [[World Marathon Majors]] series includes the five most prestigious marathon competitions at the elite level – the [[Berlin Marathon|Berlin]], [[Boston Marathon|Boston]], [[Chicago Marathon|Chicago]], [[London Marathon|London]], and [[New York City Marathon|New York City]] marathons.

[[File:NationalMarathonDC.jpg|thumb|left|Runners in the popular [[National Marathon]] race in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

The sport of road running finds its roots in the activities of [[footmen]]: male servants who ran alongside the carriages of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] around the 18th century, and who also ran errands over distances for their masters. [[Foot racing]] competitions evolved from [[Gambling|wagers]] between aristocrats, who pitted their footman against that of another aristocrat in order to determine a winner. The sport became [[Professional sports|professionalised]] as footmen were hired specifically on their athletic ability and began to devote their lives to training for the gambling events. The [[amateur sports]] movement in the late 19th century marginalised competitions based on the professional, gambling model. The [[1896 Summer Olympics]] saw the birth of the modern marathon and the event led to the growth of road running competitions through annual events such as the Boston Marathon (first held in 1897) and the [[Lake Biwa Marathon]] and [[Fukuoka Marathon]]s, which were established in the 1940s. The [[1970s running boom]] in the [[United States]] made road running a common [[pastime]] and also increased its popularity at the elite level.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/roadrunning/index.html Road running - Introduction]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-27.</ref>

Road racing events can be of virtually any distance, but a number of set distances have become common. The foremost road running event is the marathon, which is 42.195&nbsp;km (26&nbsp;[[mile]]s and 385&nbsp;[[yard]]s) long. Races over [[5 kilometres (road running)|5 kilometres]], [[10 kilometres (road running)|10&nbsp;km]], [[10 miles]], [[20 kilometres (road running)|20&nbsp;km]], and the [[Half marathon]] are common. Shorter road races over [[middle-distance running|middle-distances]] also occur, but are less common. [[Ekiden]] contests – which originated in [[Japan]] and remain very popular there – are a relay race variation on the marathon, being in contrast to the typically individual sport of road running.

===Cross country running===
{{Main|Cross country running}}
[[File:Roy Griak Invitational-20070929.jpg|thumb|Competitors mid-race at a boys high school event in the [[United States]]]]
Cross country running is the most naturalistic of the sports in athletics as competitions take place on open-air courses over surfaces such as [[grass]], [[woodland]] trails, and [[soil|earth]]. It is both an individual and [[team sport]], as runners are judged on an individual basis and a points scoring method is used for teams. Competitions are typically long distance races of 4&nbsp;km (2.5&nbsp;miles) or more which are usually held in [[autumn]] and winter. For these two reasons, cross country's most successful athletes often compete in long-distance track and road events as well.

The [[Crick Run]] in [[England]] in 1838 was the first recorded instance of an organised cross country competition. The sport gained popularity in British, then American schools in the 19th century and culminated in the creation of the first International Championship in 1903.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country - Introduction]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-27.</ref> The annual [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]] was inaugurated in 1973 and this remains the highest level of competition for the sport. A number of continental cross country competitions are held, with championships taking place in [[Asian Cross Country Championships|Asia]], [[European Cross Country Championships|Europe]], [[Americas Cross Country Championships|North America]] and [[South American Cross Country Championships|South America]]. The sport has retained its status at the scholastic level, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States. At the professional level, the foremost competitions come under the banner of the [[IAAF Cross Country Permit Meetings]].

While cross country competitions are no longer held at the Olympics, having featured in the athletics programme from 1912–1924, it has been present as one of the events within the [[modern pentathlon]] competition since the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]. One variation on traditional cross country is [[mountain running]], which incorporates significant uphill and/or downhill sections as an additional challenge to the course. [[Fell running]] and [[Orienteering]] are other competitive sports similar to cross country, although they feature an element of [[navigation]] which is absent from the set courses of cross country.

===Racewalking===
{{Main|Racewalking}}
[[File:1912 Athletics men's 10 kilometre walk.JPG|thumb|A track-side judge monitoring technique at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].]]
Racewalking is a form of competitive [[walking]] which is usually contested on courses on open-air roads, although running tracks are also occasionally used. Racewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their technique. Racewalkers must always have a foot in contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent at the knee – failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.<ref name=IAAFRaceW>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/racewalking/index.html Race Walking - Introduction]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-28.</ref> 

Racewalking finds its roots in the sport of [[pedestrianism]] which emerged in the late 18th century in England. Spectators would gamble on the outcome of the walking competitions. The sport took on an endurance aspect and competitions were held over long distances or walkers would have to achieve a certain distance within a specified time frame, such as [[Centurion (racewalking)|Centurion]] contests of walking 100&nbsp;miles (160.9&nbsp;km) within 24 hours.<ref name=IAAFRaceW/> During this period, racewalking was frequently held on athletics tracks for ease of measurement, and the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]] saw the introduction of the 3500-metre and 10-mile walks. Racewalking was briefly dropped from the Olympic programme in [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], but the men's [[50 kilometres race walk]] has been held at every Olympic Games but one since 1932. The men's [[20 kilometres race walk]] was added to the Olympic athletics schedule in 1956 and the women's event was first held in 1992. The most common events in modern competition are over 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km and 50&nbsp;km on roads, although women's 3&nbsp;km and men's 5&nbsp;km are held on indoor tracks.

The highest level racewalking competitions occur at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and at the Summer Olympics, although the sport also has its own separate major competition – the [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup]] – which has been held since 1961. The [[IAAF World Race Walking Challenge]] forms the primary seasonal competition – athletes earn points for their performances at ten selected racewalking competitions and the highest scoring walkers are entered into that year's [[IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final]].

==Venues==
Professional athletics almost exclusively takes place in one of three types of venue: [[stadium]]s, set courses on grass or woodland, and road-based courses. Such venues ensure that events take place in a relatively standardised manner, as well as improving the safety of athletes and enjoyment for spectators. At a more basic level, many forms of athletics demand very little in terms of venue requirements; almost any open space or area of field can provide a suitable venue for basic running, jumping and throwing competitions.

===Track and field stadia===
[[File:Piste athlétisme-fr.svg|thumb|right|A typical layout of an outdoor track and field stadium]]
A standard outdoor track is oval in shape, 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22&nbsp;m in width. Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3&nbsp;m) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surface. Modern tracks are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins. Older tracks may be [[cinder]]-covered.

A standard indoor track is designed similarly to an outdoor track, but is only 200 metres in length and has between four and eight lanes, each with width between 0.90&nbsp;m and 1.10&nbsp;m.<ref>http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf IAAF Competition Rules 2010-2011</ref> Often, the bends of an indoor track will be banked to compensate for the small turning radius. However, because of space limitations, indoor tracks may have other nonstandard lengths, such as 160-yard (146.3&nbsp;m) indoor track at [[Madison Square Garden]] used for the [[Millrose Games]]. Because of space limitations, meetings held at indoor facilities do not hold many of athletics events typically contested outdoors.

===Cross country courses===
[[File:Armedforces crosscountry coppingerandballas.jpg|thumb|A cross country race taking place at a snowy park in the United States.]]
There is no standardised form of cross country course and each venue is significantly defined by the environment it contains – some may be relatively flat and featureless, while others may be more challenging with natural obstacles, tight turns, and undulating ground. While a small number of purpose-built courses exist, the vast majority of cross country running courses are created by cordoning a specific area within any open natural land, typically a [[park]], [[woodland]] or [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] near a [[Human settlement|settlement]].<ref name=XCRules>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf Competition Rules 2010–11] (p.227–228). [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-31.</ref>

At the elite and professional level, courses must be looped and each lap must be between 1750&nbsp;m and 2000&nbsp;m in length. Severe obstacles such as deep ditches, high barriers and thick undergrowth not normally present; the course should be able to be completed whilst remaining on foot throughout. In order to maintain the sport's distinction from road running, the usage of unnatural or [[macadam]]ised surfaces is generally kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.<ref name=XCRules/>

Due to the fact that the majority of races take place on areas of grass, soil, mud or earth, [[weather conditions]] can significantly affect the difficulty of cross country courses, as [[snow]] and [[rain]] reduces traction and can create areas of standing water.

===Road courses===
[[File:10k run Toronto May 2010.jpg|thumb|A typical road running course on the inner-city roads of [[Toronto]]]]
The surface of road races is highly important and the IAAF dictate that the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths. Courses set along major roads of cities are typical of road running events, and [[traffic]] is usually cordoned off from the area during the competition. While soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within a track and field stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as 10&nbsp;km (6.2&nbsp;miles), or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.<ref name=RRRules>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf Competition Rules 2010–11] (p.224–226). [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-31.</ref>

Road running courses over 5&nbsp;km usually offer drinks or refreshment stations for runners at designated points alongside the course and medical professionals are present at the courses of major races due to the health risks involved with long-distance running.<ref name=RRRules/>

Elite road walks are conducted on closed loop courses (usually loops of 2,000 or 2,500 meters). Refreshment stations are also present over long distance walking competitions, with drinks being available on every lap for races longer than 10&nbsp;km.<ref name=RWRules>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/80/20091027085725_httppostedfile_CompRules-BAT_17164.pdf Competition Rules 2010–11] (p.220–223). [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 2010-05-31.</ref>

==Organisations==

Since its foundation in 1912, the [[List of international sport federations|international governing body]] for athletics has been the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). It was initially known as the International Amateur Athletics Federation but changed later its name to reflect that the sport had moved away from [[amateur sports|amateurism]] towards [[Professional sports|professionalism]] in the late 1970s. The IAAF has 213 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations).<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/aboutiaaf/structure/federations/index.html IAAF National Member Federations]. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved on 26 March 2010.</ref> The six association areas are for [[Asian Athletics Association|Asia]], [[Confederation of African Athletics|Africa]], [[European Athletics Association|Europe]], [[Oceania Athletics Association|Oceania]], [[North America, Central America and Caribbean Athletic Association|North America]] and [[South American Athletics Confederation|South America]]. The sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level and, instead, all fall under the athletics authorities.<ref name=Chap2>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/imported/9589.pdf IAAF Member Federation Manual – Chapter 2] (pp. 17–18).

==Competitions==
Athletics competitions can be broadly divided into three types: international championships, national championships, and annual meetings and races. Athletics at international championships, or Games, represent the pinnacle of competition within the sport, and they are contested between athletes representing their country or region. The organisation of these competitions is usually overseen by either a world, continental, or regional athletics governing body. Athletes gain entry into these competitions by earning selection from their national athletics governing body, which is generally done by assessing athletes via their past achievements or performances at a national selection event. National championships are annual competitions endorsed by a national governing body which serve the purpose of deciding the country's best athlete in each event. Annual one-day meetings and races form the most basic level of competition and are the most common format of athletics contests. These events are often invitational and are organised by sports organisations, sports promoters, or other institutions.

Competitions typically feature only one of the sports within athletics. However, major outdoor international athletics championships and athletics competitions held as part of [[multi-sport events]] usually feature a combination of track and field, road running and racewalking events

===International championships===
====Olympic Games====
{{Main|Athletics at the Olympic Games}}
[[File:Beijing Olympic Stadium August 15 709713b52c o.jpg|thumb|The athletics competition underway at the main stadium of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]]]
The modern [[Summer Olympics]] was the first event at which a global athletics competition took place. All the four major sports within athletics have featured in the Olympic athletics programme since its inception in 1896, although cross country has since been dropped. The Olympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest and, in addition to this, many athletics events are also among the most prominent competitions at the Summer Olympics as a whole. A total of 47 athletics events are held at the Olympics, 24 for men and 23 for women. The events within the men's and women's programmes are either identical or have a similar equivalent, with the sole exception being that men contest the 50&nbsp;km race walk.

====World Championships====
The [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]] is the primary global athletics championships held by IAAF. The biennial competition was first held in 1983 and now features an event programme which is identical to the Olympics. Thus, road running, racewalking and track and field are the sports which feature at the competition. Cross country running has its own discrete global championships – the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]] – which has been held annually since 1973. The [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics]] is a biennial athletics championships which features solely indoor track and field events. The foremost separate road running event is the annual [[IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]] (formerly World Road Running Championships). While not having official world championship status, the biennial [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup]] fulfils a similar role for the sport of racewalking. Outdoor track and field is the only sport in athletics that does not have a its own distinct global championship which is separate from other types of athletics, although the [[IAAF Continental Cup]] (a quadrennial competition between continental teams) is composed entirely of outdoor track and field events.

Other world championships include the [[IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics|IAAF World Junior]] and [[IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics|World Youth Championships in Athletics]], which are for athletes under-19 and under-17, respectively. [[World Masters Athletics]] conducts the [[World Masters Athletics Championships]] for athletes in 5 year age divisions over the age of 35.  The now defunct [[IAAF World Road Relay Championships]] served as the global event for [[ekiden]] marathon relay races.

[[File:Pentathlon athlets Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2637.jpg|thumb|150px|Ancient Greek pottery showing the javelin and the discus throw]]
Athletics, and its athletes in particular, has been artistically depicted since ancient times – one of the surviving instances include runners and high jumpers in the motifs of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs dating from 2250&nbsp;BC. Athletics was much respected in Ancient Greece and the events within the [[ancient pentathlon]] provided inspiration for large statues such as the [[Discobolus]] and [[Discophoros]], and for motifs on countless vase and [[pottery]] works. [[Aristotle]] discussed the significance of the pentathlon in his [[treatise]] ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' and reflected on the athlete aesthetic of the period: "a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength...This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/pentathlon.html Ancient Olympic Events; Pentathlon].

Films about athletics are overwhelmingly focused on running events: the 1962 film ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'' (based on the [[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner|book of the same name]]) explores cross country running as a means of escape. ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', perhaps one of the most well-known athletics films, is a fictionalised account of [[Eric Liddell]] and [[Harold Abrahams]]'s chase for sprint [[gold medal]]s at the [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]. Track and field has been the subject of American films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1981) and ''[[Across the Tracks]]'' (1991). [[Biopic]]s are found within the genre, including ''[[Prefontaine (film)|Prefontaine]]'' (regarding [[Steve Prefontaine]]) and ''[[Jim Thorpe – All-American]]'' (1951) featuring [[Burt Lancaster]] as Thorpe. Documentaries are also common with examples such as 2007 film ''[[Spirit of the Marathon]]'', which follows runners' preparations for the 2005 [[Chicago Marathon]].

Books on the subject are predominantly non-fiction, and tend towards the forms of training manuals and historical accounts of athletics. The story of the [[four-minute mile]] has been a particularly popular subject, spawning books such as ''[[The Perfect Mile]]'' and ''[[3:59.4: The Quest to Break the Four Minute Mile]]''.

Athletics [[journalism]] has spawned a number of dedicated [[periodical]]s including ''[[Athletics Weekly]]'' and ''[[Race Walking Record]]'', both of which were first published in England in the early 1940s, and ''[[Track & Field News]]'' which was first published in the United States in 1948. ''[[Runner's World]]'' has been in print since 1966 and the ''[[Track & Field Magazine of Japan]]'' (''Rikujyo Kyogi Magazine'') is another long-running publication.

Athletics events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins.  One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Running commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. In the obverse of the coin, a modern athlete figure appears in the foreground, shown in the starting position, while in the background two ancient runners are carved in a manner that gives the appearance of a coin that is "worn" by time. This scene originally appeared on a black-figure vase of the 6th century BC.
