[[Image:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sport in [[childhood]]. [[Association football]], shown above, is a [[team sport]] which also provides opportunities to nurture [[social actions|social interaction]] skills.]]

A '''sport''' is an [[organized]], [[competitive]], [[entertainment|entertaining]], and skillful [[activity]] requiring commitment, strategy, and [[sportsmanship|fair play]], in which a winner can be defined by objective means. It is governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|custom]]s. Activities such as [[card game]]s and [[board game]]s, are classified as "[[Game of skill|mind sports]]" and some are recognized as Olympic sports, requiring primarily mental skills and mental physical involvement. Non-competitive activities, for example as jogging or playing catch are usually classified as forms of [[recreation]].

Physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first often define the result of a sport. However, the degree of skill and performance in some sports such as [[diving]], [[dressage]] and [[figure skating]] is judged according to well-defined criteria. This is in contrast with other judged activities such as [[beauty pageant]]s and [[body building]], where skill does not have to be shown and the criteria are not as well defined.

Records are kept and updated for most sports at the highest levels, while failures and accomplishments are widely announced in [[sport news]]. Sports are most often played just for fun or for the simple fact that people need exercise to stay in good physical condition. However, professional sport is a major source of entertainment.

While practices may vary, sports participants are expected to display good [[sportsmanship]], and observe standards of conduct such as being respectful of opponents and officials, and congratulating the winner when losing.

==Etymology and meaning==
 {{Wiktionary}}

"Sport" comes from the [[French language|Old French]] ''desport'' meaning "leisure."  American English uses the term "sports" to refer to this general type of recreational activity, whereas other regional dialects use the singular "sport".
The Persian word for "sport" is based on the root ''bord'', meaning "winning". The Chinese term for "sport," ''tiyu'' (体育; 體育) connotes "physical training". The Modern Greek term for ''sport'' is Αθλητισμός (''athlitismos''), directly cognate with the English terms "athlete" and "athleticism."

The oldest definition of ''sport'' in English (1300) is of anything humans find amusing or entertaining.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com|title= sport (n.) |accessdate= 2008-04-20|author= Douglas Harper|date=|work= Online Etymological Dictionary}}</ref> Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.<ref>{{cite book |others= The Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff|title= Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged|publisher= G&C Merriam Company|location= Springfield, MA U.S.A.|pages= 2206, sport|quote=|year= 1967 }}</ref> Roget's defines the noun sport as an "Activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.<ref>{{cite book |title= Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|url= http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year= 1995}}</ref> An example of a more sharply defined meaning is "an athletic activity where one competitor or a team of competitors plays against another competitor or group of competitors [with] a conclusive method of scoring...not determined by a judge."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njherald.com/story/sports/08Cheer|title=Without a governing body, cheerleaders face identity crisis|publisher=New Jersey Herald|first=Anthony|last=Spalding|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=19 December 201}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of sport}}
[[Image:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]
There are artifacts and structures that suggest that the [[China|Chinese]] engaged in sporting activities as early as [[4000 BC]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm| title= Sports [[History]] in China}}</ref> Gymnastics appears to have been a popular sport in China's ancient past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm| title= Mr Ahmed D. Touny (EGY), IOC Member}}</ref> Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to the warfare skills.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&dt=10/13/2006&ntype=World| title= Persian warriors}}</ref> Among other sports that originate in ancient [[Iran|Persia]] are [[polo]] and [[jousting]].

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp| title= Ancient Olympic Games}}</ref>

Sports have been increasingly organized and regulated from the time of the Ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialization has brought increased leisure time to the citizens of developed and developing countries, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet—all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.

In the New Millennium, new sports have been going further from the physical aspect to the mental or psychological aspect of competing.  [[Electronic sports]] organizations are becoming more and more popular.

==Sportsmanship==
{{Main|Sportsmanship}}
{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}

'''Sportsmanship''' is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship| title= Merriam-Webster}}</ref><ref>See, ''e.g.'', Joel Fish and Susan Magee, ''101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent'', p. 168. Fireside, 2003. [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html] David Lacey, "It takes a bad loser to become a good winner." ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2007.</ref>

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's “not that you won or lost but how you played the game," and the Modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] are common and ongoing problems at national and international sporting contests.

==Professional sports==
[[Image:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rule]]s and are highly organized.]]
{{Main|Professional sport}}
The aspect of sports, together with the increase of mass media and leisure time, has led to professionalism in sports. This has resulted in some conflict, where the [[wage|paycheck]] are more important than recreational aspects, or where the sports are changed simply to make them more profitable and popular, thereby losing certain valued traditions.

The entertainment aspect also means that sportsmen and women are often elevated to celebrity status in media and popular culture.

==Politics==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
{{Main|Politics and sports}}

At times, sports and politics can have a large amount of influence on each other.

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x| title= Sport and apartheid}}</ref>

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]] was an [[illustration]], perhaps best recognised in retrospect, where an ideology was developing which used the event to strengthen its spread through propaganda.

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural]] [[nationalism]]. Until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of Football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sports, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue (see [[Football War]]). These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

==Physical art==
[[Image:Gymnasta.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Gymnastics]]]]
Sports have many affinities with [[art]]. For example, [[figure skating]], [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]], [[skateboarding]], [[artistic gymnastics]], [[dancesport]], and [[Tai chi chuan|Tai chi]] can be considered artistic spectacles. Similarly, there are other activities that have elements of sport and art in their execution, such as [[bodybuilding]],  [[free running]], [[martial arts]], [[professional wrestling]], [[performance art]], [[Yoga]], [[dressage]], and [[culinary arts]]. Perhaps the best example is [[bull-fighting]], which in Spain is reported in the arts pages of newspapers.

All sports involve physical and mental activities that are pursued for more than simply utilitarian reasons. For instance, running, when done as a sport, occurs for reasons beyond simply moving from one place to another. Value is gained from this activity when it is conducted simply for its own sake. This is similar to the concept of [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value, which is seeing something over and above the strictly functional value coming from an object's normal use. For instance, an aesthetically pleasing car is one which doesn't just get from A to B, but which impresses with its grace, poise, and charisma. In the same way, a sporting performance such as jumping doesn't just impress as being an effective way to avoid obstacles. It impresses because of the ability, skill, and style that is demonstrated in its performance.

Art and sports were clearly linked at the time of Ancient Greece, when gymnastics and calisthenics invoked admiration and aesthetic appreciation for the physical build, prowess and 'arete' displayed by participants. The modern term 'art' as skill, is related to this ancient Greek term 'arete'. The closeness of art and sport in these times was revealed by the nature of the Olympic Games, which were celebrations of both sporting and artistic achievements, poetry, sculpture and architectures.

==Technology==
{{Prose|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Golf player Hawaii 2002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Golf]], a [[dexterity]] sport.]]
Technology has an important role in sports, whether applied to an athlete's health, the athlete's technique, or equipment's characteristics.

* Equipment - As sports have grown more competitive, the need for better equipment has arisen. Golf clubs, bicycles, American football helmets, tennis racquets, baseball and cricket bats, Football(Association Football), hockey skates, and other equipment have all seen considerable changes when new technologies have been applied.
* Health - Ranging from nutrition to the treatment of injuries, as the knowledge of the human body has deepened over time, an athlete's potential has been increased. Athletes are now able to play to an older age, recover more quickly from injuries, and train more effectively than previous generations of athletes.
* Instruction - Advancing technology created new opportunities for research into sports. It is now possible to analyse aspects of sports that were previously out of the reach of comprehension. Being able to use motion capture to capture an athlete's movement, or advanced computer simulations to model physical scenarios has greatly increased an athlete's ability to understand what they are doing and how they can improve themselves.

==Terminology==
[[Image:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Show Jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport.]]
In [[British English]], sporting activities are commonly denoted by the [[mass noun]] "sport". In [[American English]], "sports" is more used. In all English dialects, "sports" is the term used for more than one specific sport. For example, "football and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] are my favourite sports", would sound natural to all English speakers, whereas "I enjoy sport" would sound less natural than "I enjoy sports" to North Americans.

The term "sport" is sometimes extended to encompass all competitive activities, regardless of the level of physical activity. Both [[Game of skill|games of skill]] and [[motor sport]] exhibit many of the characteristics of physical sports, such as skill, sportsmanship, and at the highest levels, even professional sponsorship associated with physical sports.  [[Air sports]], [[billiards]], [[contract bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[motorcycle racing]], and [[powerboating]] are all recognized as sports by the International Olympic Committee with their world governing bodies represented in the Association of the IOC Recognised International Sports Federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/recognized/index_uk.asp|title=Recognized non-Olympic Sports|date=2007-01-03}}</ref>

==Spectator sport==
{{Main|Spectator sport}}

As well as being a form of recreation for the participants, much sport is played in front of an [[audience]]. Most professional sport is played in a 'theatre' of some kind; be it a [[stadium]], [[arena]], [[golf course]], [[race track]], or the open road, with provision for the (often paying) public. 
[[Image:Womens australian football 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Australian Rules Football]]]]
Large television or radio audiences are also commonly attracted, with rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the 'rights' to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|Final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million. The [[Cricket World Cup]] is another sporting event which attracts a global audience. The [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] attracted about 2.3 Billion viewers all over the world. In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year. '''Super Bowl Sunday''' is a de facto national holiday in America; the viewership being so great that in 2007 advertising space was reported as being sold at [[$]]2.6m for a 30 second slot.

==Youth Sports==
Participating in sports play a large role in a child’s life. NFL quarterbacks such as [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Mark Sanchez]] began their football career in high school.  

The benefits of playing youth sports may include:
*Better grades
*Less risk of drug or alcohol use
*Chance at sports scholarships
* Health Benefits

The biggest risk for youth sports is the increased risk of injury, including concussions and gym class injuries.<ref>Time Magazine. Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007. 4 August 2009. [http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/]</ref>
