'''Rock music''' is a genre of [[popular music]] that entered the mainstream in the 1960s. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[country music]] and also drew on [[folk music]], [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. The sound of rock often revolves around the [[electric guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], and [[keyboard instrument]]s such as [[Hammond organ]], [[piano]], or, since the late 60s, [[synthesizer]]s. Rock music typically uses simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4/4 meter, with a repetitive snare drum [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|back beat]] on beats two and four.<ref>[http://www.drumbook.org/drum-lessons/rock-drums/rock-drumming/ Rock Drum Lessons] - Drumbook.org</ref> Guitar solos feature prominently in rock music; however, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[saxophone]] and blues-style [[harmonica]] are also sometimes used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form", it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d32|pure_url=yes}} "Rock and Roll"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 10 January 2010.</ref>

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, rock music developed different subgenres. When it was blended with folk music it created [[folk rock]], with blues to create [[blues-rock]] and with jazz, to create [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]]. In the 1970s, rock incorporated influences from [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], and [[Latin music]]. Also in the 1970s, rock developed a large number of subgenres, such as [[soft rock]], [[glam rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]], and [[punk rock]]. Rock subgenres that emerged in the 1980s included [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[alternative rock]]. In the 1990s, rock subgenres included [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], [[indie rock]], and [[nu metal]].

A group of musicians specializing in rock music is called a ''[[rock band]]'' or ''rock group''. Many rock groups consist of an electric [[guitarist]], lead [[Singing|singer]], [[bassist|bass guitarist]], and a [[drummer]], forming a [[quartet]]. Some groups omit one or more of these roles or utilize a lead singer who plays an instrument while singing, sometimes forming a [[trio (music)|trio]] or [[duet (music)|duo]]; others include additional musicians such as one or two [[rhythm guitar]]ists or a [[keyboardist]]. Rock bands from some genres, particularly those related to rock's foundations in rock and roll, include a saxophone. More rarely, groups also utilize bowed stringed instruments such as [[violin]]s or [[cello]]s, and brass instruments such as [[trumpet]]s or [[trombone]]s.

In the new millennium the term ''rock'' has been used as a [[blanket term]] including forms such as [[pop music]], [[reggae music]], [[soul music]], and sometimes even [[hip hop]], with which it has often been contrasted through much of its history.<ref>R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook and B. Saunders, "Introduction" in R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook, B. Saunders, eds, ''Rock Over the Edge: Transformations in Popular Music Culture'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002), ISBN 0-8223-2900-X, p. 7.</ref>

The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate [[origins of rock and roll|origins]] lay in a mixing together of various [[African-American music|black musical]] genres of the time, including [[rhythm and blues]] and [[gospel music]]; in addition to [[country music|country and western]].<ref name="Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame">[http://rockhall.com/exhibits/the-roots-of-rock/"The Roots of Rock"], ''[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'', retrieved 4 May 2010.</ref> In 1951, [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to describe the music.<ref name="BritannicaRock">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506004/rock "Rock (music)"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', retrieved 24 June 2008.</ref>

There is much debate as to what should be considered the [[first rock and roll record]]. One contender is "[[Rocket 88]]" by [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats (in fact, [[Ike Turner]] and his band The Kings of Rhythm), recorded by [[Sam Phillips]] for [[Sun Records]] in 1951.<ref name=Campbell2008>M. Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: and the Beat Goes on'' (Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), ISBN 0-495-50530-7, pp. 157–8.</ref> Four years later, [[Bill Haley]]'s "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" (1955) became the first rock and roll song to top [[Billboard magazine]]'s main sales and airplay charts, and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture.<ref>P. Browne, ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 2001), ISBN 0-87972-821-3, p. 358.</ref>

It has been argued that "[[That's All Right (Mama)]]" (1954), [[Elvis Presley]]'s first single for Sun Records in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], was the first rock and roll record,<ref>N. McCormick, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3619493/The-day-Elvis-changed-the-world.html "The day Elvis changed the world"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 24 June 2004, retrieved 17 January 2010.</ref> but, at the same time, [[Big Joe Turner]]'s "[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]", later covered by Haley, was already at the top of the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard R&B charts]]. Other artists with early rock and roll hits included [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Little Richard]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Gene Vincent]].<ref name=Campbell2008/> Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and [[crooner]]s, such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], and [[Patti Page]], who had dominated the previous decade of popular music, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed.<ref>R. S. Denisoff, W. L. Schurk, ''Tarnished Gold: the Record Industry Revisited'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 3rd edn., 1986), ISBN 0-88738-618-0, p. 13.</ref>

Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct sub-genres, including [[rockabilly]], combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as [[Carl Perkins]], Jerry Lee Lewis, [[Buddy Holly]] and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley.<ref name=AllmusicRbilly>[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d187|pure_url=yes}} "Rockabilly"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 06 August 2009.</ref> In contrast [[doo wop]] placed an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 40s African American vocal groups.<ref>F. W. Hoffmann and H. Ferstler, ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, Volume 1'' (New York, NY: CRC Press, 2nd edn., 2004), ISBN 0-415-93835-X, pp. 327–8.</ref> Acts like [[The Crows]], [[The Penguins]], [[The El Dorados]] and [[The Turbans]] all scored major hits, and groups like [[The Platters]], with songs including "[[The Great Pretender]]" (1955), and [[The Coasters]] with humorous songs like "[[Yakety Yak]]" (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> The era also saw the growth in popularity of the [[electric guitar]], and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, [[Link Wray]], and [[Scotty Moore]].<ref>J. M. Curtis, ''Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954–1984'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1987), ISBN 0-87972-369-6, p. 73.</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the [[trad jazz]] and [[English folk music|folk]] movements brought visiting [[blues music]] artists to Britain.<ref name=Schwartz2007>R. F. Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ISBN 0-7546-5580-6, p. 22.</ref> [[Lonnie Donegan]]'s 1955 hit "[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]" was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of [[skiffle music]] groups throughout the country, many of which, including [[John Lennon]]'s [[The Quarrymen]], moved on to play rock and roll.<ref>J. Roberts, ''The Beatles'' (Mineappolis, MN: Lerner Publications, 2001), ISBN 0-8225-4998-0, p. 13.</ref>

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, [[The Big Bopper]] and [[Richie Valens]] in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the [[payola]] scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the initial rock and roll era had come to an end.<ref name=Campbell2008>M. Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: and the Beat Goes On'' (Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), ISBN 0-495-50530-7, p. 99.</ref>

=== The "in-between years" ===
[[File:WIKI CHUBBY CHECKER 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Chubby Checker]] in 2005]]
The period of the later 1950s and early 1960s, between the end of the initial period of innovation and what became known in the USA as the "[[British Invasion]]", has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll. More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible.<ref>B. Bradby, "Do-talk, don't-talk: the division of the subject in girl-group music" in S. Frith and A. Goodwin, eds, ''On Record: Rock, Pop, and the Written Word'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1990), ISBN 0-415-05306-4, p. 341.</ref><ref name=Keightley2001/> While early rock and roll, particularly through the advent of rockabilly, saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers, in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists. Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]] dance craze of the early 60s, mainly benefiting the career of [[Chubby Checker]].<ref name=Keightley2001/> Having died down in the late 1950s, doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period, with hits for acts like [[The Marcels]], [[The Capris]], Maurice Williams and [[Shep and the Limelights]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1306–7.</ref> The rise of [[girl group]]s like [[The Chantels]], [[The Shirelles]] and [[The Crystals]] placed an emphasis on harmonies and polished production that was in contrast to earlier rock and roll.<ref>R. Dale, ''Education and the State: Politics, Patriarchy and Practice'', (London: Taylor & Francis, 1981), ISBN 0-905273-17-6, p. 106.</ref> Some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the [[Brill Building]] Sound, named after the block in New York where many songwriters were based, which included the number 1 hit for the Shirelles "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]" in 1960, penned by the partnership of [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Brill>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1311–2.</ref>

[[Cliff Richard]] had the first [[British rock and roll]] hit with "[[Move It]]", effectively ushering in the sound of [[British rock]].<ref>D. Hatch, S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), ISBN 0-7190-1489-1, p. 78.</ref> At the start of the 1960s, his backing group [[The Shadows]] was the most successful group recording instrumentals.<ref>A. J. Millard, ''The Electric Guitar: a History of an American Icon'' (Baltimore, MD: JHU Press, 2004), ISBN 0-8018-7862-4, p. 150.</ref> While rock 'n' roll was fading into lightweight pop and ballads, British [[rock group]]s at clubs and local dances, heavily influenced by blues-rock pioneers like [[Alexis Korner]], were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts.<ref name=AllmusicBluesp700>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, ''All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-736-6, p. 700.</ref>

Also significant was the advent of [[soul music]] as a major commercial force. Developing out of rhythm and blues with a re-injection of gospel music and pop, led by pioneers like [[Ray Charles]] and [[Sam Cooke]] from the mid-1950s, by the early 60s figures like [[Marvin Gaye]], [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] were dominating the R&B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts, helping to accelerate their desegregation, while [[Motown]] and [[Stax/Volt]] Records were becoming major forces in the record industry.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Soul>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1323–4.</ref> All of these elements, including the close harmonies of doo wop and girl groups, the carefully crafted song-writing of the Brill Building Sound and the polished production values of soul, have been seen as influencing the [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] sound, particularly the early work of [[The Beatles]], and through them the form of later rock music.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Mersey>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1319–20.</ref> Some historians of music have also pointed to important and innovative technical developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as [[Joe Meek]], and the elaborate production methods of the [[Wall of Sound]] pursued by [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=Keightley2001>K.

=== Surf music ===
{{Main|Surf music}}
The instrumental rock and roll pioneered by performers such as [[Duane Eddy]], Link Wray, and [[The Ventures]] was developed by [[Dick Dale]] who added distinctive "wet" [[reverb]], rapid alternate picking, as well as Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, producing the regional hit "[[Let's Go Trippin']]" in 1961 and launching the surf music craze. Like Dale and his [[Del-Tones]], most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the [[Bel-Airs]], the [[The Challengers (band)|Challengers]], and [[Eddie & the Showmen]].<ref>J. Blair, ''The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961–1965'' (Ypsilanti, MI: Pierian Press, 2nd edn., 1985), ISBN 0-87650-174-9, p. 2.</ref> [[The Chantays]] scored a top ten national hit with "[[Pipeline (song)|Pipeline]]" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's "[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]", by the [[Surfaris]], which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965.<ref>J. Blair, ''The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961–1965'' (Ypsilanti, MI: Pierian Press, 2nd edn., 1985), ISBN 0-87650-174-9, p. 75.</ref>

[[File:45rpmCapitol.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The label of [[The Beach Boys]]' single "[[Here Today (The Beach Boys song)|Here Today]]" (1966)]] 
The growing popularity of the genre led groups from other areas to try their hand. These included [[The Astronauts (US band)|The Astronauts]], from [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[The Trashmen]], from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], who had a number 4 hit with "Surfin Bird" in 1964 and [[The Rivieras]] from [[South Bend, Indiana]], who reached number 5 in 1964 with "California Sun".<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf>V.

Kramer]], gained some attention as surf musicians with "Cruel Sea" (1963), which was later covered by American instrumental surf bands, including The Ventures.<ref>J.

Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music, particularly the work of the [[Beach Boys]], formed in 1961 in Southern California. Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock (among them covers of music by Dick Dale) and vocal songs, drawing on rock and roll and [[doo wop]] and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the [[Four Freshmen]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf/> Their first chart hit, "[[Surfin']]" in 1962 reached the Billboard top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Beachboys>V.

T. O." (1964) and [[Rip Chords]] with "Hey Little Cobra", which both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were [[Jan & Dean]], who had a number 1 hit with "Surf City" (co-written with Brian Wilson) in 1963.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf/> The surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf/> Only the Beach Boys were able to sustain a creative career into the mid-1960s, producing a string of hit singles and albums, including the highly regarded ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' in 1966, which made them, arguably, the only American rock or pop act that could rival The Beatles.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Beachboys/>

==Emergence (mid-to late 1960s)==
=== The British Invasion ===
{{Main|British Invasion}}
[[File:The Fabs.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[The Beatles]] arriving in New York in January 1964 at the beginning of the [[British Invasion]]]]
By the end of 1962, what would become the British rock scene had started with [[beat music|beat groups]] like The Beatles, [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] and [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]] from Liverpool and [[Freddie and the Dreamers]], [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[The Hollies]] from Manchester.

Chambers, ''Urban rhythms: pop music and popular culture'' (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1985), p. 75.</ref> and particularly those from London like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Yardbirds]], were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music.<ref>J. R. Covach and G. MacDonald Boone, ''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 60.</ref> Soon these groups were composing their own material, combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat.

There was, however, particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies.<ref name=Bogdanov2002BI/> By 1963, led by the Beatles, beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain, soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts.<ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&B>V.

In 1964 the Beatles achieved a breakthrough to mainstream popularity in the United States. "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]" was the band's first number 1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], spending 7 weeks at the top and a total of 15 weeks on the chart.<ref name=BritannicaBI>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/80244/British-Invasion "British Invasion"] ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'', retrieved 29 January 2010.</ref><ref>H.

Garage rock was a form of amateurish rock music, particularly prevalent in North America in the mid-1960s and so called because of the perception that it was rehearsed in a suburban family garage.<ref name=Shuker2005>R.

The British Invasion of 1964–66 greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience, leading many (often [[Surf rock|surf]] or [[hot rod]] groups) to adopt a British Invasion lilt, and encouraging many more groups to form.<ref name=AllmusicGarage/> Thousands of garage bands were extant in the USA and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits.<ref name=AllmusicGarage>V.

Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels, most were commercial failures.

The term ''pop'' has been used since the early twentieth century to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.<ref name=Firth2001>S.

Nevertheless much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms "pop-rock" and "power pop" have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music.<ref>R.

Although the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American [[blues]], including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.<ref>H. S.

The other key focus for British blues was around [[John Mayall]] who formed the [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers|Bluesbreakers]], whose members included [[Eric Clapton]] (after his departure from The Yardbirds) and later [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Particularly significant was the release of ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton]] (Beano)'' album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States.<ref>T. Rawlings, A. Neill, C. Charlesworth and C. White, ''Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960–1969'' (London: Omnibus Press, 2002), ISBN 0-7119-9094-8, p. 130.</ref> Eric Clapton went on to form supergroups Cream, [[Blind Faith]] and [[Derek and the Dominos]], followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues-rock into the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]].<ref name=Allmusic/> Green, along with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]], formed Peter Green's [[Fleetwood Mac]], who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre.<ref name=Allmusic/> In the late '60s [[Jeff Beck]], also an alumnus of the Yardbirds, moved blues-rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, [[The Jeff Beck Group]].<ref name=Allmusic/> The last Yardbirds guitarist was [[Jimmy Page]], who went on to form ''The New Yardbirds'' which rapidly became [[Led Zeppelin]].

Early blues-rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of [[progressive rock]]. From about 1967 bands like Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience had begun to move away from purely blues-based music into psychedelia.<ref name="amg" /> By the 1970s blues-rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and [[Deep Purple]], and the lines between blues-rock and [[hard rock]] "were barely visible",<ref name="amg" /> as bands began recording rock-style albums.<ref name="amg">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d50|pure_url=yes}} "Blues-rock"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 29 September 2006.</ref> The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as [[George Thorogood]] and [[Pat Travers]],<ref name=Allmusic/> but, particularly on the British scene (except perhaps for the advent of groups such as [[Status Quo]] and [[Foghat]] who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive [[boogie rock]]), bands became focused on [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] innovation, and blues-rock began to slip out of the mainstream.<ref>P.

Roots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic scene, to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences, particularly country and folk music, leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock.<ref>P. Auslander, ''Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2008), ISBN 0-415-77353-9, p. 83.</ref> In 1966 Bob Dylan went to [[Nashville]] to record the album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''.<ref name=Wolff2000/> This, and subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, have been seen as creating the genre of [[country folk]], a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians.<ref name=Wolff2000>K. Wolff, O. Duane, ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'' (London: Rough Guides, 2000), ISBN 1-85828-534-8, p. 392.</ref> Other acts that followed the back-to-basics trend were the Canadian group [[The Band]] and the Californian-based [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s.<ref>V.

===Jazz rock===

[[File:Jaco-Pastorius seated 1980.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Jaco Pastorius]] of [[Weather Report]] in 1980]]
In the late 1960s jazz rock emerged as a distinct sub-genre out of the blues rock, psychedelic and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain the sub-genre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like [[Ginger Baker]] and [[Jack Bruce]] of Cream, had emerged from the [[British jazz]] scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York-based [[The Free Spirits]] with ''Out of Sight and Sound'' (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like [[Electric Flag]], [[Blood, Sweat and Tears]] and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/> British acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene, to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz, included [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]]<ref>I. Carr, D. Fairweather and B. Priestley, ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2004), ISBN 1843532565, p. iii.</ref> and the [[Graham Bond]] and John Mayall spin-off [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]]. From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came [[Soft Machine]], who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with [[Miles Davis]], particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Weather Report]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/> The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience,<ref name=AMJazzRock>[http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 "Jazz-rock"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 11 January 2010.</ref> but acts like [[Steely Dan]],<ref name=AMJazzRock/> Frank Zappa and [[Joni Mitchell]] recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be an major influence on rock music.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock>V.

Glam rock emerged out of the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of, and reaction against, those trends.<ref name=Shuker2005pp124-5/> Musically it was very diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like [[Alvin Stardust]] to the complex art rock of Roxy Music, and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical sub-genre.<ref name=Shuker2005pp124-5>R.

The origins of glam rock are associated with [[Marc Bolan]], who had renamed his folk duo to [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the UK TV programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in December 1970 wearing glitter, to perform what would be his first number 1 single "[[Ride a White Swan]]".<ref>P.

[[Led Zeppelin]] added elements of [[fantasy]] to their riff laden blues-rock, [[Deep Purple]] brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phrase and [[Black Sabbath]] introduced facets of the [[gothic (term)|gothic]] and [[Musical mode|modal harmony]], helping to produce a "darker" sound.<ref name=Walser1993p10>R.

Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in [[garage rock]] and other forms of what is now known as [[protopunk]] music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.<ref name=BogdanovPunk>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic|DIY]] (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.<ref>A.

By late 1976, acts such as the [[Ramones]] and [[Patti Smith]], in New York City, and the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]], in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement.<ref name=BogdanovPunk/> The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly, though briefly, became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated [[punk subculture]] emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|clothing styles]] and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].<ref>R.

Between 1982 and 1985, influenced by [[Kraftwerk]], David Bowie, and [[Gary Numan]], British New Wave went in the direction of such [[New Romantics]] as [[Spandau Ballet]], [[Ultravox]], [[Duran Duran]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Culture Club]], [[Talk Talk]] and the [[Eurythmics]], sometimes using the synthesizer to replace all other instruments.<ref name=Scaruffi2003>P.

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and New Wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 80s as its more artistic and challenging side. Major influences beside punk bands were [[The Velvet Underground]], The Who, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and the New York based [[no wave]] scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as [[James Chance and the Contortions]], [[DNA (band)|DNA]] and [[Sonic Youth]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002NewWave1337-8"/> Early contributors to the genre included the US bands [[Pere Ubu]], Devo, [[The Residents]] and [[Talking Heads]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002NewWave1337-8/> The first wave of British post-punk included [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], who placed less emphasis on art than their US counterparts and more on the dark emotional qualities of their music.<ref name=Bogdanov2002NewWave1337-8/> Bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[The Cure]], and [[The Sisters of Mercy]], moved increasingly in this direction to found [[Gothic rock]], which had become the basis of a major [[sub-culture]] by the early 1980s.<ref>L. M. E. Goodlad and M. Bibby, ''Goth: Undead Subculture'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2007), ISBN 0-8223-3921-8, p. 239.</ref> Similar emotional territory was pursued by Australian acts like [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] and [[Nick Cave]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002NewWave1337-8/> Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] and [[New Order]] respectively.<ref name=Bogdanov2002NewWave1337-8/>

The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[The Pop Group]], [[The Mekons]], [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and [[Teardrop Explodes]], tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.<ref name=Bogdanov2002NewWave1337-8/> Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was Ireland's [[U2]], who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world.<ref>F.

Although many established bands continued to perform and record, heavy metal suffered a hiatus in the face of the punk movement in the mid-1970s. Part of the reaction saw the popularity of bands like Motörhead, who had adopted a punk sensibility, and Judas Priest, who created a stripped down sound, largely removing the remaining elements of blues music, from their 1978 album ''[[Stained Class]]''.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JudasPriest>V.

Waksman, ''This Ain't the Summer of Love: Conflict and Crossover in Heavy Metal and Punk'' (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 2009), ISBN 0-520-25310-8, pp. 146–71.</ref> These bands were soon followed by acts including [[Iron Maiden]], [[Vardis]], [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]], [[Saxon]], [[Def Leppard]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]], many of which began to enjoy considerable success in the USA.<ref name=Walser2003/> In the same period [[Eddie Van Halen]] established himself as a metal guitar virtuoso after his band's [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled 1978 album]].<ref name=Christie2003/> [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] also became established virtuosos, associated with what would be known as the [[neoclassical metal]] style.<ref>P.

Inspired by NWOBHM and Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California from the late 1970s, based on the clubs of L.A.'s [[Sunset Strip]] and including such bands as [[Quiet Riot]], [[Ratt]], [[Mötley Crüe]], and [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], who, along with similarly styled acts such as New York's [[Twisted Sister]], incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of [[glam rock]] acts like Alice Cooper and Kiss.<ref name=Christie2003>I.

Walker, ''Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-And-Roll's Legendary Neighborhood'' (London: Macmillan, 2007), ISBN 0-86547-966-6, p. 241.</ref>

In the late 1980s metal fragmented into several subgenres, including [[thrash metal]], which developed in the US from the style known as [[speed metal]], under the influence of hardcore punk, with low-register guitar riffs typically overlaid by [[Shred guitar|shredding]] leads.<ref name=Bogdanov2002heavyMetal>V.

American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, [[blue collar]] American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe [[American Midwest|Midwestern]] [[arena rock]] groups like [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[REO Speedwagon]] and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll.<ref>R.

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Tom Petty]], along with less widely known acts such as [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]] and [[Joe Grushecky|Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers]], it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's ''[[Born in the USA]]'' (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steve Earle]] and more gentle singer/songwriters as [[Bruce Hornsby]].<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as [[Billy Joel]]<ref>J.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Missouri's [[The Bottle Rockets|Bottle Rockets]] and Illinois' [[Uncle Tupelo]], often find themselves these days labeled [[alt-country]].<ref>S.

The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed "alternative" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Alternative>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1344–7.</ref> Important alternative rock bands of the 1980s in the US included [[R.E.M.]], [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Sonic Youth]], and the [[Pixies]], and in the UK [[The Cure]], [[New Order]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], and [[The Smiths]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Alternative/> Artists were largely confined to [[independent record labels]], building an extensive underground music scene based on [[Campus radio|college radio]], fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth.<ref>T.

By the early 1990s, rock was dominated by commercialized and highly produced pop, rock, and "hair metal" artists, while [[MTV]] had arrived and promoted a focus on image and style.

Bands such as [[Green River (band)|Green River]], [[Soundgarden]], the [[Melvins]] and [[Skin Yard]] pioneered the genre, with [[Mudhoney]] becoming the most successful by the end of the decade.

A second wave of punk pop was spearheaded by [[Blink-182]], with their breakthrough album ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999), followed by bands such as [[Good Charlotte]], [[Bowling for Soup]] and [[Sum 41]], who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk.<ref name=LambPunkPop/> Later pop-punk bands, including [[Simple Plan]], [[All-American Rejects]] and [[Fall Out Boy]], had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore, while still achieving considerable commercial success.<ref name=LambPunkPop/>

Since its early development rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most obviously in early rock and roll's rejection of an adult-dominated culture, the counter-culture's rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk's rejection of all forms of social convention,<ref>P. Wicke, ''Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 1995), ISBN 0-521-39914-9, pp. 91–114.</ref> however, it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action.<ref>E.
