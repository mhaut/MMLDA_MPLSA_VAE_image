{{Campaignbox Franco-Prussian War}}
[[File:Kleve forstgarten obelisk winter 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Obelisk in [[Kleve]]]]
The '''Franco-Prussian War''' or '''Franco-German War''', often referred to in France as the '''1870 War'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Taithe|first=Bertrand|title=Citizenship and Wars: France in Turmoil 1056-1871|publisher=Routledge|year=2001}}</ref> (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871) was a conflict between the [[Second French Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Prussia was aided by the [[North German Confederation]], of which it was a member, and the South German states of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[History of Württemberg#The Kingdom of Württemberg (1806–1918)|Württemberg]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final [[unification of Germany]] under King [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I of Prussia]]. It also marked the downfall of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the [[French Third Republic]]. As part of [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|the settlement]], the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of [[World War I]] when it was given back to France in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

The conflict was a culmination of years of tension between the two nations, which finally came to a head over the issue of a [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] candidate for the [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain#La Gloriosa (1868–1873)|vacant Spanish throne]], following the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|deposition]] of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] in 1868. The public release of the [[Ems Dispatch]], which played up alleged insults between the Prussian king and the French ambassador, inflamed public opinion on both sides. France mobilized, and on 19 July declared war on Prussia only, but the other German states quickly joined on Prussia's side.

It soon became evident that the Prussian and German forces were superior, due in part to their efficient use of [[Rail transport|railways]] and the better [[Krupp]] steel [[artillery]]. Prussia had the fourth densest rail network in the world; France had the fifth.<ref name=vanCreveld>In ''Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton'' (1977), Martin van Creveld argues that the significance of Moltke's use of railways has been somewhat exaggerated:
<blockquote>There is no doubt that the German siege and bombardment of Paris, involving as they did the concentration in a small space of very large masses of men and heavy expenditure of artillery ammunition, would have been wholly impossible without the railways.  Also, the view that the German use of the railways to deploy their forces at the opening of the campaign as a supreme masterpiece of the military art is amply justified, though we have seen that this triumph was only achieved at the cost of disrupting the train apparatus before the war against France even got under way.  Between these two phases of the struggle, however, the railways do not seem to have played a very important role, partly because of difficulties with the lines themselves and partly because of the impossibility of keeping the railheads within a reasonable distance of the advancing troops.  Most surprising, however, is the fact that none of this had much influence on the course of operations, or indeed caused Moltke any great concern... (p.96)</blockquote></ref> A series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France culminated in the [[Battle of Sedan]], at which Napoleon III was captured with his whole army on 2 September. Yet this did not end the war, as the Third Republic was declared in Paris on 4 September 1870, and French resistance continued under the [[Government of National Defence]] and later [[Adolphe Thiers]].

Over a five-month campaign, the German armies defeated the newly recruited French armies in a series of battles fought across northern France. Following a [[Siege of Paris|prolonged siege]], Paris fell on 28 January 1871. The siege is also notable for the first use of anti-aircraft artillery, a Krupp piece built specifically to shoot down the hot air balloons being used by the French as couriers. Ten days earlier, the German states had proclaimed their union under the Prussian king, uniting Germany as a [[nation-state]], the [[German Empire]]. The final [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] was signed 10 May 1871, during the time of the [[Paris Commune]] uprising of 1871.

==Causes of the war==
{{main|Causes of the Franco-Prussian War}}
The causes of the Franco-Prussian War are deeply rooted in the events surrounding the balance of power in Europe after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. France and Prussia had been combatants, with France on the losing side and [[Napoleon I]] exiled to [[St. Helena]]. Upon the ascension of [[Napoleon III]], events soon brought them to war four years after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. It is thought that [[Otto von Bismarck]] was keen to bring about the war, noting in his book, after being forced to resign from the role of Chancellor, that "I knew that a Franco-Prussian War must take place before a united Germany was formed."

==Opposing forces==
{{for|the organization of the two armies at the beginning of the war|Franco-Prussian War Order of Battle}}
The French Army comprised approximately 400,000 regular soldiers, some of them veterans of previous French campaigns in the [[Crimean War]], Algeria, the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] in Italy, and in Mexico in support of the [[Second Mexican Empire]]. The infantry were equipped with the breech-loading [[Chassepot rifle]], one of the most modern mass-produced firearms in the world at the time. With a rubber ring seal and a smaller bullet, the Chassepot had a maximum effective range of some {{Convert|1500|m}} with a short reload time. The artillery was equipped with rifled, muzzle-loaded [[La Hitte system#Change_in_meaning_of_gun_designations|Lahitte "4-pounder"]] (actual weight of shot: {{Convert|4|kg|abbr=on|disp=s}}) guns. In addition, the army was equipped with a precursor to the machine-gun: the [[mitrailleuse]], which was mounted on an artillery gun carriage and grouped in [[Artillery battery|batteries]] in a similar fashion to cannon. The army was nominally led by Napoleon III with Marshals [[Francois Achille Bazaine]], [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]], and [[Jules Trochu]] among others.

The Prussian Army was composed not of regulars but conscripts. Service was compulsory for all of the men of military age, thus Prussia and its North and South German allies could mobilise and field some 1.2 million soldiers in time of war. The sheer number of soldiers available made mass-encirclement and destruction of enemy formations advantageous. The army was still equipped with the "needle-gun" [[needle gun|Dreyse rifle]] of [[Battle of Königgrätz]] fame, which was by this time showing the age of its 25 year old design. The deficiencies of the needle-gun were more than compensated for by the famous [[Krupp]] 6-pounder (3&nbsp;kg) steel breech-loading cannons being issued to Prussian artillery batteries. Firing a contact-detonated shell filled with zinc balls and explosive, the Krupp gun had a range of {{Convert|4500|m}} and blistering rate of fire compared to the French bronze muzzle loading cannon. The Prussian army was commanded by Field-Marshal [[Helmuth Graf von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke]] and the Prussian General Staff. The Prussian army was unique in Europe for having the only General Staff in existence, whose sole purpose was to direct operational movement, organise logistics and communications and develop the overall war strategy. In practice, a chief of staff was a much more important figure in the Prussian Army than in any other army, because he had the right to appeal against his superior to the commander of the next highest formation. Thus, for example, the Crown Prince was unable to contradict the advice of his Chief of Staff, [[Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal|General Leonhard, Count von Blumenthal]], for fear of a direct appeal (in this case) to his father the King.

Given that France maintained a strong standing army, and that Prussia and the other German states would need weeks to mobilise their conscript armies, the French held the initial advantage of troop numbers and experience. French tactics emphasised the defensive use of the Chassepot rifle in trench-warfare style fighting; German tactics emphasised encirclement battles and using artillery offensively whenever possible.

==Summary of military events==
German mobilization contrasted with confusion and delay on the French side. Germany was able to deliver 380,000 troops to the forward zone within 18 days of the start of July 14 mobilization, while many French units reached the front either late or with inadequate supplies. The German and French armies that then confronted each other were both grouped into right and left wings. After suffering a check at the [[Battle of Wörth]] on August 6, 1870, the commander of the French right (south) wing, Marshal Patrice Mac-Mahon, retreated westward. That same day, about {{Convert|40|mi}} to the northwest, the commander of the French left wing, Marshal Achille Bazaine, was dislodged from near Saarbrücken and fell back westward to the fortress of Metz. His further retreat was checked by the German right wing in two blundering battles on August 16 and 18, respectively (the Battles of [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour|Mars-la-Tour]] and [[Battle of Gravelotte|Gravelotte]]), and he then took refuge behind the defenses of Metz until the end of hostilities.
The French right wing, commanded by Mac-Mahon and accompanied by Napoleon III himself, attempted to relieve Bazaine but was itself surrounded and trapped by the Germans in the disastrous  [[Battle of Sedan]] on August 31. Encircled, the 83,000 French troops with Napoleon III and Mac-Mahon surrendered on September 2. Since Bazaine's army was still bottled up in Metz, the result of the war was virtually decided by this surrender.
French resistance was carried on against desperate odds by a new government of national defense, which assumed power in Paris on September 4, 1870, and proclaimed the deposition of the emperor and the establishment of the Third Republic. On September 19 the Germans began to besiege Paris. [[Jules Favre]], foreign minister in the new government, went to negotiate with Bismarck, but the negotiations were broken off when he found that Germany demanded both [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] regions. [[Léon Gambetta]], the leading figure in the provisional government, organized new French armies in the countryside after escaping from besieged Paris in a balloon. These engaged but could not defeat the German forces. Bazaine capitulated at Metz with his 140,000 troops intact on October 27, and Paris surrendered on January 28, 1871.

==French Army incursion==
===Preparations for the offensive===
[[Image:FrancoPrussianWarFrontierJuly1870.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Map of German and French armies near their common border on 31 July 1870]]
On 28 July 1870 Napoleon III left Paris for [[Metz]] and assumed command of the newly titled Army of the Rhine, some 202,448 strong and expected to grow as the French mobilization progressed.<ref>Howard(1991), p. 78.</ref> [[Marshal MacMahon]] took command of I Corps (4 infantry divisions) near [[Wissembourg]], Marshal [[François Certain Canrobert|François Canrobert]] brought VI Corps (4 infantry divisions) to [[Châlons-en-Champagne|Châlons-sur-Marne]] in northern France as a reserve and to guard against a Prussian advance through Belgium.

A pre-war plan laid out by the late Marshal [[Adolphe Niel]] called for a strong French offensive from [[Thionville]] towards [[Trier]] and into the Prussian Rhineland. This plan was discarded in favour of a defensive plan by Generals [[Charles Auguste Frossard|Charles Frossard]] and Bartélemy Lebrun, which called for the Army of the Rhine to remain in a defensive posture near the German border and repel any Prussian offensive. As Austria along with Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden were expected to join in a revenge war against Prussia, I Corps would invade the [[Palatinate of the Rhine|Bavarian Palatinate]] and proceed to "free" the South German states in concert with Austro-Hungarian forces. VI Corps would reinforce either army as needed.<ref>Wawro(2003), pp. 66-67.</ref>

Unfortunately for [[Charles Auguste Frossard|General Frossard]]'s plan, the Prussian army was mobilizing far more rapidly than expected. The Austro-Hungarians, still smarting after their defeat by Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War, were treading carefully before stating that they would only commit to France's cause if the southern Germans viewed the French positively. This did not materialize as the South German states had come to Prussia's aid and were mobilizing their armies against France.<ref>Howard(1991), pp. 47, 48, 60.</ref>

===Occupation of Saarbrücken===
[[File:Detaille - A French Cavalry Officer Guarding Captured Bavarian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|French [[Lancers]] and [[Cuirassiers]] guarding captured [[Bavaria]]n soldiers]]
Napoleon III was under immense domestic pressure to launch an offensive before the full might of Moltke's forces was mobilized and deployed. Reconnaissance by [[Charles Auguste Frossard|General Frossard]] had identified only the [[16th Division (German Empire)|Prussian 16th Infantry Division]] guarding the border town of [[Saarbrücken]], right before the entire Army of the Rhine. Accordingly, on 31 July the Army marched forward toward the [[Saar River]] to seize Saarbrücken.<ref>Wawro(2003), pp. 85, 86, 90.</ref>

General Frossard's II Corps and Marshal Bazaine's III Corps crossed the German border on 2 August, and began to force the Prussian 40th Regiment of the 16th Infantry Division from the town of [[Saarbrücken]] with a series of direct attacks. The [[Chassepot]] rifle proved its worth against the [[Needle gun|Dreyse rifle]], with French riflemen regularly outdistancing their Prussian counterparts in the skirmishing around Saarbrücken. However the Prussians resisted strongly, and the French suffered 86 casualties to the Prussian 83 casualties. Saarbrücken also proved to be a major obstacle in terms of logistics. Only one railway there led to the German hinterland but could be easily defended by a single force, and the only river systems in the region ran along the border instead of inland.<ref>Wawro(2003), pp. 87, 90.</ref> While the French hailed the invasion as the first step towards the Rhineland and later Berlin, General Le Bœuf and Napoleon III were receiving alarming reports from foreign news sources of Prussian and Bavarian armies massing to the southeast in addition to the forces to the north and northeast.<ref>Wawro(2003), p. 94</ref>

Moltke had indeed massed three armies in the area—the Prussian First Army with 50,000 men, commanded by [[Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz|General Karl von Steinmetz]] opposite [[Saarlouis]], the Prussian Second Army with 134,000 men commanded by [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828-1885)|Prince Friedrich Karl]] opposite the line [[Forbach]]–[[Battle of Spicheren|Spicheren]], and the Prussian Third Army with 120,000 men commanded by Crown Prince [[Friedrich III, German Emperor|Friedrich Wilhelm]], poised to cross the border at [[Wissembourg]].<ref>Howard(1991), p. 82.</ref>

==Prussian Army advance==
===Battle of Wissembourg===
{{main|Battle of Wissembourg (1870)}}
[[File:French soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71.jpg|thumb|French soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71]]
Upon learning from captured Prussian soldiers and a local area police chief that the Second Army was just {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Saarbrücken near the town of Wissembourg, General Le Bœuf and Napoleon III decided to retreat to defensive positions. General Frossard, without instructions, hastily withdrew the elements of Army of the Rhine in Saarbrücken back to Spicheren and Forbach.<ref>Wawro(2003), p. 95.</ref>

Marshal MacMahon, now closest to Wissembourg, left his four divisions spread {{convert|20|mi|km}} apart in diameter to react to any Prussian invasion. This organization of forces was due to a lack of supplies, forcing each division to seek out basic provisions along with the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to aid them. What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of General [[Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot]], commander of MacMahon's 1st Division. He told General Abel Douay, commander of MacMahon's 2nd Division, on 1 August that ''"The information I have received makes me suppose that the enemy has no considerable forces very near his advance posts, and has no desire to take the offensive"''.<ref>Howard(1991), pp. 100-101.</ref> Two days later, he told MacMahon that he had not found ''"a single enemy post [...] it looks to me as if the menace of the Bavarians is simply bluff"''. Even though Ducrot shrugged off the possibility of an attack by the Germans, MacMahon still tried to warn the other divisions of his army, without success.<ref>Howard(1991), p. 101.</ref>

The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870. This bloody little battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but poorly coordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. As the day wore on, elements of one Bavarian and two Prussian Corps became embroiled in the fight, and were aided by Prussian artillery which blasted holes in the defences of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially thanks to the accurate long range fire of the Chassepots, but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a [[caisson (military)|caisson]] of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him. No matter who took his place, the encirclement of the town by the enemy had put the entire division in peril.<ref>Wawro(2003), pp. 97-98, 101.</ref>

The fighting within the town had become extremely intense, becoming a door to door battle of survival. Despite a never ending attack of Prussian infantry, the soldiers of the 2nd Division kept to their positions. It was the people of the town of Wissembourg that surrendered to the Germans, refusing to even help their own soldiers fight on, thinking of it as a lost cause. Those who did not surrender retreated westward, leaving behind 1,000 captured men and all of their remaining ammunition.<ref>Wawro(2003), pp. 101-103.</ref> The Prussians seemed poised to capitalize on these happenings, and the French appeared still woefully unaware of the now forming Prussian juggernaut.

===Battle of Spicheren===
{{main|Battle of Spicheren}}

[[Image:FrancoPrussianWar5to6Aug1870.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Prussian and German offensive, 5 August and 6 August 1870]]
The Battle of Spicheren, on 5 August, was the second of three critical French defeats. Moltke had originally planned to keep Bazaine's army on the [[Saar River]] until he could attack it with the 2nd Army in front and the 1st Army on its left flank, while the 3rd Army closed towards the rear. The aging General [[Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz|Karl von Steinmetz]] made an overzealous, unplanned move, leading the 1st Army south from his position on the [[Moselle]]. He moved straight toward the town of [[Spicheren]], cutting off [[Prince Frederick Charles]] from his forward cavalry units in the process.<ref>Wawro(2003), p. 108.</ref>

On the French side, planning after the disaster at Wissembourg had become essential. General Le Bœuf, flushed with anger, was intent upon going on the offensive over the Saar and countering their loss. However, planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride, as Intendant General Wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the Saar would be impossible. Therefore, the armies of France would take up a defensive position that would protect against every possible attack point, but also left the armies unable to support each other.<ref>Howard(1991), pp. 87-88.</ref>

While the French army under General MacMahon engaged the German 3rd Army at the [[Battle of Wörth]], the German 1st Army under Steinmetz finished their advance west from Saarbrücken. A patrol from the German 2nd Army under [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828-1885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]] spotted decoy fires close and Frossard's army farther off on a distant plateau south of the town of Spicheren, and took this as a sign of Frossard's retreat. Ignoring Moltke's plan again, both German armies attacked Frossard's French 2nd Corps, fortified between Spicheren and Forbach.<ref>Howard(1991), pp. 89-90.</ref>

The French were unaware of their numerical superiority at the beginning of the battle as the German 2nd Army did not attack all at once. Treating the oncoming attacks as merely skirmishes, Frossard did not request additional support from other units. By the time he realized what kind of a force he was opposing, it was too late. Seriously flawed communications between Frossard and those in reserve under Bazaine slowed down so much that by the time the reserves received orders to move out to Spicheren, German soldiers from the 1st and 2nd armies had charged up the heights.<ref>Howard(1991), pp. 92-93.</ref> Because the reserves had not arrived, Frossard erroneously believed that he was in grave danger of being outflanked as German soldiers under General von Glume were spotted in Forbach. Instead of continuing to defend the heights, by the close of battle after dusk he retreated to the south. The German casualties were relatively high due to the advance and the effectiveness of the chassepot rifle. They were quite startled in the morning when they had found out that their efforts were not in vain&ndash;Frossard had abandoned his position on the heights.<ref>Howard(1991), pp. 98-99.</ref>

===Battle of Wörth (known also as Fröschwiller or Reichshoffen)===
{{main|Battle of Wörth}}

[[Image:ReichshoffenMorot1870.jpg|thumb|left|350px|[[Aimé Morot]]'s ''La bataille de Reichshoffen'', 1887]]
The two armies clashed again two days later on 6 August 1870 near [[Wœrth|Wörth]] in the town of [[Fröschwiller]], less than ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Wissembourg. The German 3rd army had drawn reinforcements which brought its strength up to 140,000 troops. The French had also been reinforced, but their recruitment was slow, and their force numbered only 35,000. Although badly outnumbered, the French defended their position just outside Fröschwiller. By afternoon, both sides had suffered about 10,000 casualties, and the French army was too battered to continue resisting. To make matters even more dire for the French, the Germans had taken the town of Fröschwiller which sat on a hilltop in the centre of the French line. Having lost any hope for victory and facing a massacre, the French army disengaged and retreated in a westerly direction, hoping to join other French forces on the other side of the Vosges mountains. The German 3rd army did not pursue the withdrawing French. It remained in Alsace and moved slowly south, attacking and destroying the French defensive garrisons in the vicinity.

The battle of Wörth was the first major battle of the Franco-German war, with more than 100,000 troops in the battlefield. It was also one of the first clashes where troops from various German states (Prussians, Badeners, Bavarians, Saxons, etc.) fought jointly. These facts have led some historians to call the battlefield of Wörth the "cradle of Germany". It was not without cost, however, as Prussia lost 10,500 to death or wounds. MacMahon's situation was even more dire, as French casualties reached 19,200 killed, wounded or captured.<ref>Howard(1991), p. 116</ref>

===Battle of Mars-La-Tour===
{{main|Battle of Mars-La-Tour}}

[[Image:Battle-Mars-Le-Tour-large.jpg|thumb|325px|right|The Prussian 7th Cuirassiers charge the French guns at the [[Battle of Mars-La-Tour]], 16 August 1870.]]
With the Prussian army now steamrolling, 130,000 French soldiers were bottled up in the fortress of Metz following several defeats at the front. Their attempt to leave Metz in order to link up with French forces at Châlons was spotted by a Prussian cavalry patrol under Major Oskar [[von Blumenthal]]. Four days after their retreat, on 16 August a grossly outnumbered Prussian force of 30,000 men of III Corps (of the 2nd Army) under General Konstantin von Alvensleben, found the French Army near Vionville, east of Mars-la-Tour.

Despite odds of four to one, the III Corps launched a risky attack. The French were routed, and the III Corps captured Vionville, blocking any further escape attempts to the west. Once blocked from retreat, the French in the fortress of Metz had no choice but to engage in a fight that would see the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe. The battle soon erupted, and III Corps was decimated by the incessant [[cavalry charge]]s, losing over half its soldiers. Meanwhile, French suffered equivalent numerical losses of 16,000 soldiers, but still held on to overwhelming numerical superiority.

On 16 August, the French had a chance to sweep away the key Prussian defence, and to escape. Two Prussian corps attacked the French advanced guard thinking that it was the rearguard of the retreat of the French Army of the Meuse. Despite this misjudgment the two Prussian [[corps]] held the entire French army for the whole day. Outnumbered 5 to 1, the extraordinary élan of the Prussians prevailed over gross indecision by the French. The French had lost the opportunity to win a decisive victory.<ref>Holden-Reid 1999, p. 198.</ref>

===Battle of Gravelotte===
{{main|Battle of Gravelotte}}

The Battle of Gravelotte, or Gravelotte-St. Privat, was the largest battle during the Franco-Prussian War. It was fought about six miles (10&nbsp;km) west of Metz, Lorraine, France where on the previous day, having intercepted the French army's retreat to the west at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour, the Prussians were now closing in to complete the destruction of the French forces.

The combined German forces, under Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, were the Prussian First and Second Armies of the North German Confederation numbering about 210 infantry battalions, 133 cavalry squadrons, and 732 heavy cannons totaling 188,332 officers and men. The French Army of the Rhine, commanded by Marshal François-Achille Bazaine, numbering about 183 infantry battalions, 104 cavalry squadrons, backed by 520 heavy cannons, totaling 112,800 officers and men, dug in along high ground with their southern left flank at the town of Rozerieulles, and their northern right flank at St. Privat.

On 18 August, the battle began when at 08:00 Moltke ordered the First and Second Armies to advance against the French positions. By 12:00, General Manstein opened up the battle before the village of Amanvillers with artillery from the [[25th Division (German Empire)|25th Infantry Division]]. But the French had spent the night and early morning digging trenches and rifle pits while placing their artillery and their mitrailleuses in concealed positions. Finally aware of the Prussian advance, the French opened up a massive return fire against the mass of advancing Germans. The battle at first appeared to favour the French with their superior [[Chassepot]] rifle. However, the Prussian artillery was superior with the all-steel Krupp breech-loading gun.

[[Image:Gravelotte.JPG|thumb|400px|left|[[Juliusz Kossak]], ''Battle of Gravelotte'', depicting the Prussians at Gravelotte, 1871]]
By 14:30, General Steinmetz, the commander of the First Army, unilaterally launched his VIII Corps across the Mance Ravine in which the Prussian infantry were soon pinned down by murderous rifle and mitrailleuse fire from the French positions. At 15:00, the massed guns of the VII and VIII Corps opened fire to support the attack. But by 16:00, with the attack in danger of stalling, Steinmetz ordered the VII Corps forward, followed by the 1st Cavalry Division.

By 16:50, with the Prussian southern attacks in danger of breaking up, the Prussian [[3rd Guards Infantry Brigade]] of the Second Army opened an attack against the French positions at St-Privat which were commanded by General Canrobert. At 17:15, the Prussian [[4th Guards Infantry Brigade]] joined the advance followed at 17:45 by the Prussian [[1st Guards Infantry Brigade]]. All of the Prussian Guard attacks were pinned down by lethal French gunfire from the rifle pits and trenches. At 18:15 the Prussian [[2nd Guards Infantry Brigade]], the last of the [[1st Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|1st Guards Infantry Division]], was committed to the attack on St. Privat while Steinmetz committed the last of the reserves of the First Army across the Mance Ravine. By 18:30, a considerable portion of the VII and VIII Corps disengaged from the fighting and withdrew towards the Prussian positions at Rezonville.

With the defeat of the First Army, Prince Frederick Charles ordered a massed artillery attack against Canrobert's position at St. Privat to prevent the Guards attack from failing too. At 19:00 the 3rd Division of Fransecky's II Corps of the Second Army advanced across Ravine while the XII Corps cleared out the nearby town of Roncourt and with the survivors of the 1st Guards Infantry Division launched a fresh attack against the ruins of St. Privat. At 20:00, the arrival of the Prussian [[4th Division (German Empire)|4th Infantry Division]] of the II Corps and with the Prussian right flank on Mance Ravine, the line stabilised. By then, the Prussians of the 1st Guards Infantry Division and the XII and II Corps captured St. Privat forcing the decimated French forces to withdraw. With the Prussians exhausted from the fighting, the French were now able to mount a counter-attack. [[Charles Denis Bourbaki|General Bourbaki]], however, refused to commit the reserves of the French Old Guard to the battle because, by that time, he considered the overall situation a 'defeat'.

By 22:00, firing largely died down across the battlefield for the night. The next morning, the French Army of the Rhine, rather than resume the battle with an attack of its own against the battle-weary German armies, retreated to Metz where they were besieged and forced to surrender two months later.

The casualties were horrible, especially for the attacking Prussian forces. A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed, wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle. The French losses were 7,855 killed and wounded along with 4,420 prisoners of war (half of them were wounded) for a total of 12,275. While most of the Prussians fell under the French Chassepot rifles, most French fell under the Prussian Krupp shells. In a breakdown of the casualties, Frossard's II Corps of the Army of the Rhine suffered 621 casualties while inflicting 4,300 casualties on the Prussian First Army under Steinmetz before the Pointe du Jour. The Prussian Guards Infantry Divisions losses were even more staggering with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men. The Special Guards [[Jäger (military)|Jäger]] lost 19 officers, a surgeon and 431 men out of a total of 700. The 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 39 officers and 1,076 men. The 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 36 officers and 1,060 men. On the French side, the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village.

===Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan===
{{main|Siege of Metz|Battle of Sedan}}
With the defeat of Marshal Bazaine's Army of the Rhine at Gravelotte, the French were forced to retire to Metz where they were besieged by over 150,000 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies. The further crushing French loss was sealed when the 180,000 soldiers surrendered on 27 October.

[[File:Franco-prussian war faubourg Metz.jpg|thumb|left|Franco-Prussian war of 1870. Defense of Metz by the French Army.]]

As a result of the defeat, [[Napoleon III]], along with Field Marshal MacMahon, formed the new French Army of Châlons to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine. With Napoleon III personally leading the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance, they led the Army of Châlons in a left-flanking march northeast towards the Belgian border in an attempt to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine.

[[Image:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|350px|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] after the [[Battle of Sedan]] by [[Wilhelm Camphausen]]]]
The Prussians, under the command of Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, took advantage of this manoeuvre to catch the French in a pincer grip. Leaving the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, Moltke formed the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony by detaching three corps from them, and took this army and the Prussian Third Army northward, where they caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August. After a sharp fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan. Having reformed in the town, the Army of Châlons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies. Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately. With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field.

[[File:CuirassiersMetz1870.jpg|thumb|right|French Army in Metz, 1870]]

On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. [[Emmanuel Félix de Wimpffen|General De Wimpffen]], the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Marguerite was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses.

By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking out, Napoleon III called off the attacks. The French lost over 17,000 men, killed or wounded, with 21,000 captured. The Prussians reported their losses at 2,320 killed, 5,980 wounded and 700 captured or missing.

By the next day, on 2 September, Napoleon III surrendered and was taken prisoner with 104,000 of his soldiers. It was an overwhelming victory for the Prussians, for they not only captured an entire French army, but the leader of France as well. The defeat of the French at Sedan had decided the war in Prussia's favour. One French army was now immobilised and besieged in the city of Metz, and no other forces stood on French ground to prevent a German invasion. Nevertheless, the war would drag on for five more months.

==The Government of National Defense==
When news hit Paris of Emperor Napoleon's III capture, the French Second Empire was overthrown in a bloodless and successful coup d'état which was launched by [[Louis Jules Trochu|General Trochu]], [[Jules Favre]], and [[Léon Gambetta]] at Paris on 4 September. They removed the second Bonapartist monarchy and proclaimed a republic led by a [[Government of National Defence]], leading to the Third Republic. Napoleon III was taken to Germany, and released later. He went into exile in the United Kingdom, dying in 1873.

After the German victory at Sedan, most of France's standing forces were out of combat, one army was immobilised and besieged in the city of Metz, and the army led by Emperor Napoleon III himself had surrendered to the Germans. Under these circumstances, the Germans hoped for an armistice which would put an official end to the hostilities and lead to peace. Prussia's Prime Minister von Bismarck, in particular, wanted to end the war as soon as possible. To a nation with as many neighbors as Prussia, a prolonged war meant the growing risk of intervention by another power, and von Bismarck was determined to limit that risk.

At first, the outlook for peace seemed fair. The Germans estimated that the new government of France could not be interested in continuing the war that had been declared by the monarch they had quickly deposed. Hoping to pave the road to peace, von Bismarck invited the new French Government to negotiations held at [[Château de Ferrières]] and submitted a list of moderate conditions, including limited territorial demands in [[Alsace]]. Further claims of a French border along the Rhine in [[Rhineland-Palatinate|Palatinate]] had been made since ([[Adolphe Thiers]], [[Rhine crisis]]) 1840, while the Germans vowed to defend both banks of the Rhine (''[[Die Wacht am Rhein]], [[Deutschlandlied]]''). As Prussia had recently acquired large areas populated by Catholics, further extensions were not considered desirable by Bismarck.

===Armistice rejection and continuance of hostilities===
[[Image:ParisCafeDiscussion.png|left|thumb|325px|"Discussing the War in a Paris Café"— a scene published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' of 17 September 1870.]]
While the republican government was amenable to reparation payments or transfer of colonial territories in Africa or in South East Asia to Prussia, Jules Favre on behalf of the Government of National Defense declared on 6 September that France would not "yield an inch of its territory nor a stone of its fortresses."<ref>{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Gordon A.|title=Germany: 1866-1945|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|pages=31}}</ref> The republic then renewed the declaration of war, called for recruits in all parts of the country, and pledged to drive the enemy troops out of France. 

Under these circumstances, the Germans had to continue the war, yet couldn't pin down any proper military opposition in their vicinity. As the bulk of the remaining French armies were digging-in near Paris, the German leaders decided to put pressure upon the enemy by attacking Paris. In October, German troops reached the outskirts of the heavily fortified city of Paris. The Germans surrounded it and erected a blockade, as already established and ongoing at Metz.

When the war broke out, European public opinion heavily favored the Germans. For example, many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in [[Florence]], and a Prussian diplomat visited [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in [[Caprera]]. Bismarck's demand for the return of Alsace caused a dramatic shift in that sentiment in Italy, which was best exemplified by the reaction of Garibaldi soon after the revolution in Paris, who told the ''Movimento'' of Genoa on 7 September 1870 that "Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means."<ref>{{cite book|last=Ridley|first=Jasper|title=Garibaldi|publisher=Viking Press|year=1976|pages=602}}</ref> Subsequently, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the [[Army of the Vosges]], an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans.

===Siege of Paris===
{{main|Siege of Paris}}
[[Image:Franco-Prussian War - Students Going to Man the Barricades - Illustrated London News Oct 1 1870.jpg|thumb|300px|"The War: Defence of Paris—Students Going to Man the Fortifications"—one of the iconic images of the [[Siege of Paris]].]]
The [[Siege of Paris]] (19 September 1870 – 28 January 1871) brought about the final defeat of the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War. On 18 January the new [[German Empire]] was proclaimed at the [[Palace of Versailles]].

Faced with the German blockade of Paris, the new French government called for the establishment of several large armies in France's provinces. These new bodies of troops were to march towards Paris and attack the Germans there from various directions at the same time. In addition, armed French civilians were to create a guerilla force — the so-called ''[[Francs-tireurs]]'' — for the purpose of attacking German support lines.

These developments prompted calls from the German civilian public for a bombardment of the city. General [[Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal]], who commanded the siege, was opposed to the bombardment on moral grounds. In this he was backed by other senior military figures such as the Crown Prince and Moltke. All of them had married English wives and as a result they were accused of coming under English liberal influence.

===Loire campaign===
Dispatched from Paris as the republican government's emissary, Léon Gambetta passed over the German lines in a balloon inflated with coal gas from the city's gasworks, and organized the recruitment of new French armies.

News about an alleged German "extermination" plan infuriated the French and strengthened their support to their new government. Within a few weeks, five new armies totaling more than 500,000 troops were recruited.

The Germans noticed this development and dispatched some of their troops to the French provinces in order to detect, attack, and disperse the new French armies before they could become a menace, for the blockade of Paris or elsewhere. The Germans were not prepared for an occupation of the whole of France. This would overstretch them and they would become vulnerable.

On October 10, fighting erupted between German and French republican forces near [[Orléans]]. At first, the Germans were victorious, but the French drew reinforcements and defeated the Germans at [[Coulmiers]] on November 9 . But after the surrender of [[Siege of Metz|Metz]], more than 100,000 well-trained and battle-experienced German troops joined the German 'Southern Army'. With these reinforcements, the French were forced to abandon Orléans on December 4, to be finally defeated at the [[Battle of Le Mans]] (between  January 10–12).

A second French army which operated north of Paris was turned back near [[Amiens]] (November 27, 1870), [[Bapaume]] ( January 3, 1871) and [[St. Quentin]] ( January 13).

===Northern campaign===
[[File:Bapaume-tableau-Faidherbe.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Bapaume (1871) took place on the 2 – 3 January 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War in and around Biefvillers-lès-Bapaume and Bapaume. The Prussian advance was stopped by Genéral Louis Léon César Faidherbe at the head of the ‘’Armée du Nord’’.]]
Following the Army of the Loire's defeats, Gambetta turned to [[Louis Faidherbe|General Faidherbe]]'s Army of the North. The Army of the North had achieved several small victories at towns such as Ham, La Hallue, and [[Amiens]], and was well-protected by the belt of [[fortress]]es in northern France, allowing Faidherbe's men to launch quick attacks against isolated Prussian units, then retreat behind the belt of fortresses. Despite the army's access to the armaments factories of [[Lille]], the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties which kept the soldiers' already poor morale at a permanently low level. In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply problems, the terrible winter weather, and low troop quality, whilst General Faidherbe himself was unable to direct battles effectively due to his terrible health, the result of decades of campaigning in [[West Africa]]. At the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1871)|Battle of St. Quentin]], the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered, releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East.

===Eastern campaign===
Following the destruction of the French Army of the Loire, remnants of the Loire army gathered in eastern France to form the Army of the East, commanded by General [[Charles Denis Bourbaki|Charles Bourbaki]]. In a final attempt to cut the German supply lines in northeast France, Bourbaki's army marched north to attack the Prussian siege of [[Belfort]] and relieve the beleaguered French defenders.

In the battle of the Lisaine, Bourbaki's men failed to break through German lines commanded by General [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich August Leopold, Count von Werder|August von Werder]]. Bringing in the German 'Southern Army', General [[Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel|von Manteuffel]] then drove Bourbaki's army into the mountains near the Swiss border. Facing annihilation, this last intact French army crossed the border and was disarmed and imprisoned by the neutral Swiss near Pontarlier (1 February).

===Armistice===
On 28 January 1871 the Government of National Defense based in Paris negotiated an armistice with the Prussians. With Paris starving, and Gambetta's provincial armies reeling from one disaster after another, French foreign minister [[Jules Favre]] went to [[Versailles]] on 24 January to discuss peace terms with Bismarck.

Bismarck agreed to end the siege and allow food convoys to immediately enter Paris (including trains carrying millions of German army rations), on condition that the Government of National Defence surrender several key fortresses outside Paris to the Prussians. Without the forts, the French Army would no longer be able to defend Paris. Although public opinion in Paris was strongly against any form of surrender or concession to the Prussians, the Government realised that it could not hold the city for much longer, and that Gambetta's provincial armies would probably never break through to relieve Paris. President [[Jules Trochu]] resigned on 25 January and was replaced by [[Jules Favre]], who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight.

At [[Tours]], Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed. A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a ceasefire across France.

==French and Prussian naval activities==
At the outset of the war, the French government ordered a [[blockade]] of the North German coasts, which the relatively small North German navy ([[Norddeutsche Bundesmarine]]) could do little to oppose. Despite this, the blockade was only partially successful due to crucial oversights by the planners in Paris. Conscripts that were supposed to be at the ready in case of war were in use in Newfoundland fisheries or in Scotland, thereby reducing manpower. Therefore, only partial elements of the 470-ship [[French Navy]] put to sea on 22 July 1870. Before long, the French navy began to suffer shortages of [[coal]]. An unsuccessful blockade of Wilhelmshaven and conflicting orders on whether or not to proceed to the [[Baltic Sea]] or to return to France made the French naval efforts ineffective.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rüstow|first=Wilhelm|coauthors=John

[[Image:FrenchFleet1870.jpg|thumb|300px|left|French warships at sea in 1870]]

To relieve pressure from the expected German attack into Alsace-Lorraine, Napoleon III and others in the French high command planned at the outset of the war to launch a [[amphibious warfare|seaborne invasion]] of northern Germany. It was hoped that the invasion would not only divert German troops from the front, but also inspire Denmark to assist with its 50,000 strong army and substantial [[Royal Danish Navy|navy]]. However it was discovered that Prussia had recently installed formidable defences around the major North German ports, including [[coastal artillery]] batteries consisting of Krupp heavy artillery that could hit French ships from a distance of {{convert|4000|yd|m|sigfig=2}}. The French Navy lacked the necessary heavy weaponry to deal with these coastal defences, while the difficult [[topography]] of the Prussian coastline (see the article [[Wadden Sea]]) made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible.<ref>Wawro(2003), pp. 190-192.</ref>

The [[French Marines]] and [[naval infantry]] tasked with the invasion of northern Germany were subsequently dispatched to bolster the French Army of Châlons, where they were captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]] along with Napoleon III. Suffering a severe shortage of officers following the capture of most of the professional French army at the [[Siege of Metz]] and the Battle of Sedan, naval officers were taken from their ships to officer the hastily assembled ''gardes mobiles'' or French reserve army units.<ref name=wawro192>Wawro(2003), p. 192.</ref>

As the autumn storms of the North Sea took their toll on the remaining patrolling French ships, the blockade became less and less effective. By September 1870, the blockade was finally abandoned altogether for the winter, and the French Navy retired to ports along the [[English Channel]], remaining in port for the rest of the war.<ref name=wawro192/>

Isolated engagements took place between French and German ships in other theaters, such as the blockade by [[FS Dupleix (1861)|FS ''Dupleix'']] of the German ship ''Hertha'' in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan<ref>{{cite book|last=Maurice|first=John Frederick|coauthors=Wilfred James Long|title=The Franco-German War, 1870-71|publisher=S. Sonnenschein and Co.|year=1900|pages=587–588}}</ref>, and [[Battle of Havana (1870)|the gunboat battle]] between the Prussian ''Meteor'' and the French ''Bouvet'' outside of [[Havana, Cuba]], in November 1870.<ref>Rüstow(1872), p. 243.</ref>

== Factors resulting in German victory ==
==== General Staff system ====
The [[German General Staff|Prussian General Staff]] developed by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]] proved to be extremely effective, in contrast to the traditional French school:

{{Quotation|"Moltke could count on the ability of the Prussian officer to find original solutions for the tactical problems of war. These officers dropped the official service regulations of 1847 as soon as they [[Austro-Prussian War|crossed the Bohemian frontier in 1866]] and followed their own ideas."|Hojo Holborn, "Moltke's Strategical Concepts."<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1982846 Holborn, Hojo. "Moltke's Strategical Concepts." ''Military Affairs'', Vol. 6, No. 3 (Autumn, 1942), pp. 153-168: 159.]</ref>}}

{{Quotation|"The primary cause of the French military collapse in 1870 was previous reliance upon a vicious system for the education, promotion, and assignment of officers. This system was unable to suffocate all intellectual progress in the army, although it was marvelously suited for that purpose. But it was almost completely effective in excluding the army's brain power from the staff and high command. To the resulting lack of intelligence at the top can be ascribed all the inexcusable defects of French military policy... Criticism of the French officers for their ineffectiveness in the opening campaigns of this war, however, would be largely misdirected, for with some exceptions they did the best they knew how and very bravely. The cause of their difficulties was insufficient preparation for war of the proper sort in time of peace, particularly intellectual preparation."|Dalas D. Irvine, "The French and Prussian Staff Systems Before 1870."<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3038792 Irvine, Dalas D. "The French and Prussian Staff Systems Before 1870." ''The Journal of the American Military History Foundation'' Vol. 2, No. 4 (Winter, 1938), 192-203, (accessed June 18, 2010): 192, 203.]</ref>}}

==== Universal conscription ====
[[Albrecht von Roon]], the [[Prussian Minister of War]] from 1859 to 1873, established a draft  where every male Prussian capable of fighting would be conscripted at the time of mobilization. Thus, despite the population of France being greater than the population of all of the German states that participated in the war, the Germans mobilized more soldiers for battle.

|}

==== Railways ====
At the outset of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated flawlessly on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost (or mislaid) 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration.<ref>McElwee, p. 46</ref> This was largely due to the Prussian mobilization plan using railways.

==== Diplomatic isolation ====
Although [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Denmark]] had both wished to avenge their recent military defeats against Prussia, they chose not to intervene in the war due to a lack of confidence in the French. [[Napoleon III]] also failed to cultivate alliances with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[United Kingdom]], partially due to the diplomatic efforts of the Prussian chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], and thus faced the German states alone.

==== Armaments ====
"The French had a good [[breech-loading rifle]], the [[chassepot]], also the [[mitrailleuse]], a primitive [[machine gun]], but their muzzle-loading [[artillery]] was outclassed by Prussian breech-loaders."<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/franco-prussian-war Richard Holmes, "Franco-Prussian war." ''Military History Companion'', retrieved 22 June 2010.]</ref> The superior Prussian artillery would prove to be a greater advantage than the superior French infantry at the [[Battle of Gravelotte]].

Countries previously without a General Staff or a system of universal [[conscription]] soon adopted both, along with developments in [[logistics]], military use of [[rail transport|railways]],<ref name=vanCreveld/> and the [[telegraphy|telegraph]] system, all proven by the German victory to be indispensable.

===Prussian reaction and withdrawal===
[[Image:Okupacja1871.png|thumb|Areas of France occupied until the war reparations were paid.]]
The Prussian Army held a brief victory parade in Paris on 17 February, and Bismarck honoured the armistice by sending trainloads of food into Paris and withdrawing Prussian forces to the east of the city, which would be withdrawn as soon as France agreed to pay five-billion francs in war indemnity.<ref>Taylor(1988), p. 133.</ref> At the same time, Prussian forces were withdrawn from France and concentrated in the provinces of [[Alsace]] and [[Moselle|Lorraine]]. An exodus occurred from Paris as some 200,000 people, predominantly middle-class, left the city for the countryside. Paris was quickly re-supplied with free food and fuel by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and several accounts recall life in the city settling back to normal.

===French reaction to the defeat===

National elections produced an overwhelmingly conservative government, which, under President Adolphe {{lang|fra|Thiers}}, established itself in [[Versailles]], fearing that the political climate of Paris was too dangerous to set up the capital in the city. The new government, formed mainly of conservative, middle-class rural politicians, passed a variety of laws which greatly angered the population of Paris, such as the controversial [[Law of Maturities]], which decreed that all rents in Paris, which had been postponed since September 1870, and all public debts across France, which had been given a [[Debt moratorium|moratorium]] in November 1870, were to be paid in full, with interest, within 48 hours. Paris shouldered an unfairly high proportion of the indemnity payments made to the Prussians, and the population of the city quickly grew resentful of the Versailles government. With Paris under the protection of the revolutionary [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] and few regular soldiers in the city, left-wing leaders established themselves in the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] and established the [[Paris Commune]], which was savagely repressed by Versailles with the loss of 20,000 lives.

In the 1890s, the [[Dreyfus Affair]] developed out of the aftermath of the war when confidential French military information was discovered in a wastebasket at the German Embassy in Paris by an agent of French military counter intelligence. An Alsace-born French captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], who was also Jewish, was framed for this action and sentenced to life imprisonment for treason. He was finally rehabilitated and freed by 1900.

The [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]], in addition to giving Germany the city of [[Strasbourg]] and the fortification at [[Metz, France|Metz]], gave Germany the possession of Alsace and the northern portion of Lorraine (Moselle), both of which (especially Alsace) were home to a majority of ethnic Germans and contained 80% of French iron ore and machine shops.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The loss of this territory was a source of resentment in France for years to come, and contributed to public support for [[World War I]], in which France vowed to take back control of Alsace-Lorraine. This ''[[revanchism]]'' created a permanent state of crisis between Germany and France ([[French-German enmity]]), which would be one of the contributing factors leading to World War I.

===German unification and power===
[[Image:Wernerprokla.jpg|Proclamation of the German Empire, painted by [[Anton von Werner]]|thumb|300px]]
The creation of a unified [[German Empire]] ended the "balance of power" that had been created with the [[Congress of Vienna]] after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Germany quickly established itself as the main power in continental Europe with one of the most powerful and professional armies in the world. Although Great Britain remained the dominant world power, British involvement in European affairs during the late 19th century was very limited, allowing Germany to exercise great influence over the European mainland. Besides, the Crown Prince's marriage with the daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was only the most prominent of several German-British relationships.

===The Polish aspect===

In the Prussian [[province of Posen]], with a large [[Poles|Polish]] population, there was strong support for the French and angry demonstrations at news of Prussian-German victories — a clear manifestation of Polish nationalist feeling. Calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army — though these went mainly unheeded. An alarming report on the Posen situation, sent to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] on 16 August 1870, led to the quartering of reserve troop contingents in the restive province <ref>[[Christopher Clark]], "The Iron Kingdom", p. 579.</ref> The Franco-Prussian War thus turned out to be a significant event also in German-Polish relations, marking the beginning of a prolonged period of repressive measures by the authorities and efforts at [[Germanisation]].
