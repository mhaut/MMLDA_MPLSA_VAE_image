'''Folk music''' is a term for musical [[folklore]]. The term, which originated in the 19th century, has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted by mouth, as music of the lower classes, and as music with unknown composers. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. Since the middle of the 20th century, the term has also been used to describe a kind of [[popular music]] that is based on traditional music.<ref name = "AboutDefinition">http://folkmusic.about.com/od/glossary/g/FolkMusic.htm  About.com definition</ref>  Fusion genres include [[folk rock]], [[electric folk]], [[folk metal]], [[progressive folk]], [[psychedelic folk]] and [[neofolk]].

==Origins and definitions==
Throughout most of human prehistory and history, listening to recorded music was not possible, and the work of economic production was often manual and communal. Music was made by common people during both their work and leisure. [[Manual labour]] often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the boredom of repetitive tasks, it kept the rhythm during synchronized pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as planting, weeding, reaping, threshing, weaving, and milling. In leisure time, singing and playing musical instruments were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than today, when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.<ref name = "SeegerLomaxDocumentary">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr9FP93o8Ro  Alan Lomax's 1947 Documentary narrated by Pete Seeger</ref>

The terms ''folk music'', ''folk song'', and ''[[folk dance]]'' are comparatively recent expressions. They are extensions of the term ''[[folk lore]]'', which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian [[William Thoms]] to describe "the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes."<ref name="Percy Scholes 1977">Percy Scholes, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 1977, article "Folk Song".</ref> The term is further derived from the German expression [[Völkisch movement|''Volk'']], in the sense of "the people as a whole" as applied to popular and national music by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and the German Romantics over half a century earlier.<ref>A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, page 13.</ref>

[[Image:Indian village musicians.jpg|thumb|260|left|''Indians always distinguished between classical and folk music, although in the past even classical Indian music used to rely on the unwritten transmission of repertoire.'']]
A literary interest in the popular ballad was not new: it dates back to [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] and [[William Wordsworth]]. English Elizabethan and Stuart composers had often evolved their music from folk themes, the classical [[Suite (music)|suite]] was based upon stylised folk-dances and [[Joseph Haydn]]'s use of folk melodies is noted. But the emergence of the term "folk" coincided with an "outburst of national feeling all over Europe" that was particularly strong at the edges of Europe, where [[Self-determination|national identity]] was most asserted. [[Musical nationalism|Nationalist composers]] emerged in Eastern Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain and Britain: the music of [[Antonin Dvorak|Dvorak]], [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] and many others drew upon folk melodies. The English term "folklore", to describe traditional music and dance, entered the vocabulary of many continental European nations, each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists.<ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"/>

However, despite the assembly of an enormous body of work over some two centuries, there is still no certain definition of what folk music (or folklore, or the folk) is.<ref>Richard Middleton,  ''Studying Popular Music'', Philadelphia: Open University Press (1990/2002). ISBN 0-335-15275-9, p. 127.</ref> Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics<ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"/> but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of "old songs, with no known composers",<ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2">Ronald D. Cohen ''Folk music: the basics'' (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 1-2</ref> another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary "process of [[oral transmission]].... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character."<ref name="Lloyd 1969">International Folk Music Council definition (1954/5), given in Lloyd (1969) and Scholes (1977).</ref> Such definitions depend upon "(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...", upon "''continuity'' and ''oral transmission''...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural dichotomy, the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in 'primitive' societies and in parts of 'popular cultures'."<ref>[[Charles Seeger]] (1980), citing the approach of Redfield (1947) and Dundes (1965), quoted in Middleton (1990) p.127</ref>

[[Image:Cecil-sharp-appalachia-map.gif|thumb|right|250px|''Locations in Southern and Central Appalachia visited by the British folklorist Cecil Sharp in 1916 (blue), 1917 (green), and 1918 (red). Sharp sought "old world" English and Scottish ballads passed down to the region's inhabitants from their British ancestors. He collected hundreds of such ballads, the most productive areas being the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky.'']]

For Scholes,<ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"/> as for [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[Béla Bartók]],<ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, page 14-5">A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, page 14-5.</ref> there was a sense of the music of the country as distinct from that of the town. Folk music was already "seen as the authentic expression of a way of life now past or about to disappear (or in some cases, to be preserved or somehow revived),"<ref>Middleton 1990, p.127.</ref> particularly in "a community uninfluenced by art music"<ref name="Lloyd 1969"/> and by commercial and printed song. Lloyd rejected this in favour of a simple distinction of economic class<ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, page 14-5"/> yet for him too folk music was, in [[Charles Seeger]]'s words, "associated with a lower class in societies which are culturally and socially stratified, that is, which have developed an elite, and possibly also a popular, musical culture." In these terms folk music may be seen as part of a "schema comprising four musical types: 'primitive' or 'tribal'; 'elite' or 'art'; 'folk'; and 'popular'."<ref name="Charles Seeger 1980 p.127">Charles Seeger (1980) quoted in Middleton (1990) p.127</ref>

Revivalists' opinions differed over the origins of folk music: it was said by some to be art music changed and probably debased by oral transmission, by others to reflect the character of the race that produced it.<ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"/> Traditionally, the cultural transmission of folk music is through [[playing by ear]], although [[notation]] may also be used. The competition of individual and collective theories of composition set different demarcations and relations of folk music with the music of tribal societies on the one hand and of "art" and "court" music on the other. The traditional cultures that did not rely upon written music or had less social stratification could not be readily categorised. In the proliferation of popular music genres, some music became categorised as "World music" and "Roots music".

[[Image:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The American conception of "folk composition" has often drawn on [[Afro-American music]]'']]

The distinction between "authentic" folk and national and popular song in general has always been loose, particularly in America and Germany<ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"/>  - for example popular songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]] could be termed "folk" in America.<ref>Example given by both Scholes (1977) and Lloyd (1969)</ref> The [[International Folk Music Council]] definition allows that the term "can also be applied to music which has originated with an individual composer and has subsequently been absorbed into the unwritten, living tradition of a community. But the term does not cover a song, dance, or tune that has been taken over ready-made and remains unchanged."<ref>Quoted by both Scholes (1977) and Lloyd (1969)</ref>

The post-World War II folk revival in America and in Britain brought a new meaning to the word. Folk was seen as a musical style, the ethical antithesis of commercial "popular" or "pop" music, while the Victorian appeal of the "Volk" was often regarded with suspicion. The popularity of "contemporary folk" recordings caused the appearance of the category "Folk" in the [[Grammy Award]]s of 1959: in 1970 the term was dropped in favour of "Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording (including Traditional Blues)", while 1987 brought a distinction between "Best Traditional Folk Recording" and "Best Contemporary Folk Recording". The term "folk", by the start of the 21st century, could cover "[[Singer-songwriter|singer song-writers]], such as [[Donovan]] and [[Bob Dylan]], who emerged in the 1960s and much more"<ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2"/> or perhaps even  "a rejection of rigid boundaries, preferring a conception, simply of varying practice within one field, that of 'music'."<ref name="Charles Seeger 1980 p.127"/>

Many Asian civilisations distinguish between art/court/classical styles and "folk" music, though cultures that do not depend greatly upon notation and have much anonymous art music must distinguish the two in different ways from those suggested by western scholars. For example the late [[Alam Lohar]] is a good example of a classical South Asian folk singer of great repute.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}<!--Several claims here need verifying: (1) that many Asian cultures differentiate art/court/classical styles and folk music, (2) that these cultures distinguish these categories in ways different from those suggested by Western scholars, and (3) that Alam Lohar is a good example of a singer of great repute. At the same time, a connection needs to be established between this last statement and the preceding sentence.-->

===Celtic traditional music===
{{See also|Folk music of Ireland}}

[[Celtic music]] is a term used by artists, record companies, music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of [[musical genre]]s that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the [[Celtic people]]s of [[Western Europe]]. These traditions include [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of the Isle of Man|Manx]], [[Music of Cornwall|Cornish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]], [[Breton music|Breton]] traditions.  [[Galician music]] is often included, though significant research showing that this has any close musical relationship is lacking. [[Music of Brittany|Brittany]]'s Folk revival began in the 1950s with the "bagadoù" and the "kan-ha-diskan" before growing to world fame through [[Alan Stivell]]'s work since the mid-1960s.<ref name=saw>{{Cite book|author=Sawyers, June Skinner|title=Celtic Music: A Complete Guide|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-81007-7}}</ref>

In [[Ireland]], [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] (although its members were all Irish-born, the group became famous while based in New York's Greenwich Village), [[The Dubliners]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[Planxty]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Irish Rovers]], and a variety of other folk bands have done much over the past few decades to revitalise and re-popularise [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]]. These bands were rooted, to a greater or lesser extent, in a living tradition of Irish music and benefited from the efforts of artists such as [[Seamus Ennis]] and [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]].<ref name=saw/>

During the Communist era national folk dancing was actively promoted by the state.
Dance troupes from Russia and Poland toured Western Europe from about 1937 to 1990. The [[Red Army Choir]] recorded many albums. A [[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|female choir from Bulgarian State Radio]] recorded "Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares" which was promoted by British DJ [[John Peel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Hungarian group [[Muzsikás]] played numerous American tours and participated in the Hollywood movie ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' while the singer [[Márta Sebestyén]] worked with the band [[Deep Forest]]. The Hungarian ''[[táncház]]'' movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, the traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas, and it has also begun to disappear in Romania.

The movement revived broader folk traditions of music, dance, and costume together and created a new kind of music club. The movement spread to ethnic Hungarian communities around the world. Today, almost every major city in the U.S. and Australia has its own Hungarian folk music and folk dance group; there are also groups in Japan, Hong Kong, Argentina and Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Balkan folk music was influenced by the mingling of Balkan ethnic groups in the period of [[Ottoman Empire]]. It comprises the music of [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Music of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]], [[Music of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Music of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Music of Romania|Romania]], [[Music of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Music of Albania|Albania]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkey]], the historical states of [[Music of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] or the [[Music of Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] and geographical regions such as [[Music of Thrace|Thrace]]. Some music is characterised by complex rhythm. An important part of the whole Balkan folk music is the music of the local [[Romani music|Romani]] ethnic minority.

===Notable venues===
It is sometimes claimed that the earliest folk festival was the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, 1928, in Asheville, North Carolina, founded by [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]]. Sidmouth Festival began in 1954, and Cambridge Folk Festival began in 1965. The [[Cambridge Folk Festival]] in [[Cambridge]], [[England]] is noted for having a very wide definition of who can be invited as folk musicians. The "club tents" allow attendees to discover large numbers of unknown artists, who, for ten or 15 minutes each, present their work to the festival audience.

Folk music is still popular among some audiences today, with folk music clubs meeting to share traditional-style songs, and there are major folk music festivals in many countries, e.g. the [[Woodford Folk Festival]], [[National Folk Festival]] and [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]] are amongst Australia's largest major annual events, attracting top international folk performers as well as many local artists. This includes the music of [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[Naturalismo]], [[Will Oldham|Bonnie "Prince" Billy]], [[Devendra Banhart]] and others.

[[Anti-folk]] now has a home at the Antihootenany in the [[East Village]], where artists like [[Beck]], [[Regina Spektor]], [[the Moldy Peaches]] and [[Nellie McKay]] got their starts.

==European folk revival==
The first folk revival influenced western [[classical music]]. Such composers as [[Percy Grainger]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Béla Bartók]], made field recordings or transcriptions of folk singers and musicians.

In Spain Isaac Albéniz (1860–1909) produced piano works reflect his Spanish heritage, including the ''Suite Iberia'' (1906–1909). Enrique Granados (1867–1918) composed ''zarzuela'', Spanish light opera, and ''Danzas Españolas'' - Spanish Dances. Manuel de Falla (1876–1946) became interested in the [[cante jondo]] of Andalusian [[flamenco]], the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works, which include [[Nights in the Gardens of Spain]] and ''Siete canciones populares españolas'' ("Seven Spanish Folksongs", for voice and piano). Composers such as [[Fernando Sor]] and [[Francisco Tarrega]] established the [[guitar]] as Spain's national instrument.  Modern Spanish Folk artists abound (Mil i Maria, Russian Red et al.) modernizing whilst respecting the traditions of their forebears.

Flamenco grew in popularity through the 20th century, as did northern styles such as the Celtic music of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. French classical composers, from [[Bizet]] to [[Ravel]], also drew upon Spanish themes, and distinctive Spanish genres became universally recognised.

==Folk revival of the 1950s in Britain and America==
[[Image:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Woody Guthrie'']]
{{See also|American folk music revival|British folk revival|Roots revival}}
While the Romantic nationalism of the folk revival had its greatest influence on art-music, the "second folk revival" of the later 20th century brought a new genre of [[popular music]] with artists marketed by amplified concerts, recordings and broadcasting. The American [[Woody Guthrie]] collected folk music in the 1930s and 1940s and also composed his own songs, as did [[Pete Seeger]]. In the 1930s [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], in the 1940s [[Burl Ives]] and in the 1950s Seeger's group [[The Weavers]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[The Kingston Trio]], and [[The Limeliters]] found a popularity that culminated in the ''[[Hootenanny (US TV series)|Hootenanny]]'' television series<ref>[http://www.tvtome.com/Hootenanny/ http://www.tvtome.com/Hootenanny/] ''TVtome.com'' Retrieved on 05-03-07</ref> and the associated magazine ''[[Linda Solomon|ABC-TV Hootenanny]]'' in 1963–1964. ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazine helped spread both traditional and composed songs, as did folk-revival-oriented record companies.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the folk revival fostered young artists like [[The Watersons]], [[Martin Carthy]] and [[Roy Bailey (folk singer)|Roy Bailey]] and a generation of singer-songwriters such as [[Bert Jansch]], [[Ralph McTell]], [[Donovan]] and [[Roy Harper]]. [[Bob Dylan]], [[Paul Simon]] and Tom Paxton visited Britain for some time in the early 1960s, the first two, particularly, making later use of the traditional English material they heard.

In 1950 [[Alan Lomax]] came to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and met [[A.L. Lloyd|A.L.'Bert' Lloyd]] and [[Ewan MacColl]], a meeting credited as inaugurating the second British folk revival. In London the colleagues opened The Ballads and Blues Club, eventually renamed the Singers' Club, possibly the first [[folk club]]: it closed in 1991. As the 1950s progressed into the 1960s, the folk revival movement built up in both Britain and America.

In the 1960s, folk singers and songwriters such as [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Phil Ochs]], and [[Tom Paxton]] followed in [[Woody Guthrie|Guthrie's]] footsteps, writing "[[protest song|protest music]]" and [[topical song]]s and expressing support for the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]]. The Canadians [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Bruce Cockburn]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] were all invested with the [[Order of Canada]]. Dylan's use of electric instruments helped inaugurate the genres of [[folk rock]] and [[country rock]], particularly by his album ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'' and his support for the music of [[The Band]]. Many of the [[acid rock]] bands of San Francisco began by playing acoustic folk and blues.

The late 1960s saw the advent of [[electric folk]] groups, a key moment being the release of [[Fairport Convention]]'s album ''[[Liege and Lief]]''. Guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] declared that the music of The Band demanded a corresponding "English Electric" style, while bassist [[Ashley Hutchings]] formed [[Steeleye Span]] in order to pursue a wholly traditional repertoire. In the second half of the 1990s, once more, folk music made an impact on the mainstream music via a younger generation of artists such as [[Eliza Carthy]], [[Kate Rusby]] and [[Spiers and Boden]].

==Popular subgenres==
Contemporary [[country music]] descends ultimately from a rural American folk tradition, but has evolved. [[Bluegrass music]] is a professional development of American [[old time music]], intermixed with [[blues]] and [[jazz]]. Exponents of [[electric folk]] music such as [[Fairport Convention]], [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Alan Stivell]], [[Mr. Fox]] and [[Steeleye Span]] saw electrification of traditional musical forms as a means to reach a far wider audience. Traditional folk music merged with [[rock and roll]] to form [[folk rock]] performers such as [[The Byrds]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[The Mamas & the Papas]]. Since the 1970s a genre of "contemporary folk" fueled by new singer-songwriters has continued with such artists as [[Chris Castle]], [[Steve Goodman]], and [[John Prine]]. [[The Pogues]] and Ireland's [[The Corrs]] brought traditional tunes back into the [[album]] charts.

In the 1980s artists like [[Phranc]] and [[The Knitters]] propagated [[cowpunk]] or [[folk punk]], which eventually evolved into [[alt country]]. More recently the same spirit has been embraced and expanded on by performers such as [[Dave Alvin]], [[Miranda Stone]] and [[Steve Earle]].

[[Hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Korpiklaani]], [[Skyclad (band)|Skyclad]], [[Waylander (band)|Waylander]] and [[Finntroll]] meld elements from a wide variety of traditions, including in many cases instruments such as [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddles]], [[tin whistle]]s, [[accordions]] and [[bagpipes]]. [[Folk metal]] often favours [[Paganism|pagan]]-inspired themes. [[Black metal]] and [[Viking metal]] are defined on their folk stance, incorporating folk interludes into albums (e.g., [[Bergtatt]] and [[Kveldssanger]], the first two albums by once-black metal, now-[[experimental music|experimental]] band [[Ulver]]).

[[Filk music]] can be considered folk music stylistically and culturally (though the 'community' it arose from, [[science fiction fandom]], is an unusual and thoroughly modern one).<ref>[http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm|Filk Hall of Fame acceptance speeches by Sally and Barry Childs-Helton]</ref> [[Neofolk]] began in the 1980s, fusing traditional European folk music with [[post-industrial music]], historical topics, philosophical commentary, traditional songs and [[paganism]]. The genre is largely European.

[[Anti folk]], began in New York City in the 1980s. [[Folk punk]], known in its early days as rogue folk, is a fusion of folk music and punk rock. It was pioneered by the London-based Irish band [[The Pogues]] in the 1980s. [[Radical folk]] of the present claims to tackle age old political issues such as [[workers rights]] and [[capital punishment]]. It is represented by groups such as such as [[The Last Internationale]] of New York.
