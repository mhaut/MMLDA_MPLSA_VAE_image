The '''chicken''' (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') is a  [[Domestication|domesticated]] [[fowl]], a subspecies of the [[Red Junglefowl]]. As one of the most common and widespread [[domestic animals]], and with a population of more than 24 billion in 2003,<ref>according to Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds, Ed. Perrins, Christopher. Buffalo, N.Y.: Firefly Books, Ltd., 2003.</ref> there are more chickens in the world than any other species of [[bird]]. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their [[Chicken (food)|meat]] and their [[egg (food)|eggs]].

Recent evidence suggests that domestication of the chicken was already under way in [[Thailand]],<ref name=oneMatriarch>{{citation|title=One subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus gallus) suffices as the matriarchic ancestor of all domestic breeds |first=A |last=Fumihito |first2=T |last2=Miyake|first3=S |last3=Sumi|first4=M |last4=Takada |first5=S |last5=Ohno|first6=N |last6=Kondo|journal=PNAS |date=December 20, 1994 |volume=91 |number=26  |pages=12505–12509}}</ref> [[Vietnam]] and the [[South East Asia]]n jungles over 10,000 years ago, and spread into neighboring regions to the east such as [[China]], and towards the west in [[India]] where it was [[conventional wisdom|conventionally thought]] to have been domesticated <ref name=Sherman>Sherman, David M.

==Terminology==
In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens are primarily known as ''cocks'', whereas in America, Canada and Australia they are more commonly called ''[[rooster]]s''. Males under a year old are ''cockerels''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cockerel |title=cockerel - Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>  Castrated roosters are called ''[[capon]]s'' (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world).  Females over a year old are known as ''hens'', and younger females are ''pullets''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pullet |title=pullet - Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>  In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term ''chook'' ({{pron-en|ˈtʃʊk}}: rhymes with "book") to describe all ages and both sexes.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Definition of "chook" in ''Encarta''.  The vernacular use is said to be offensive in this dictionary but it may also be used as a term of jocular familiarity|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQrJia9|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Babies are called ''chicks'', and the meat is called ''[[#Chickens as food|chicken]]''.

"Chicken" originally referred to chicks, not the species itself. The species as a whole was then called ''domestic fowl'', or just ''fowl''.  This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a [[UK|British]] [[public house]] or [[theatre]] name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example [[Hen and Chicken Islands]]).

==General biology and habitat==
Chickens are [[omnivore]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ideas-4-pets.com/pages-infopages/pages_id-24/index.html |title=Info on Chicken Care |accessdate=2008-08-13 |publisher=ideas4pets |year=2003}}</ref>  In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, [[insects]] and even larger animals such as [[lizard]]s or young [[mice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gworrell.freeyellow.com/chickenfaq.html|title=Frequently asked questions about chickens & eggs |accessdate=2008-08-13|publisher=Ferry Landing Farm & Apiary|author=Gerard P.Worrell AKA "Farmer Jerry"}}</ref>

Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (''hackles'') and backs (''saddle'') which are typically of brighter, bolder colors than those of females of the same species. However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright (chicken)|Sebright]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same color as the hen's. The identification must be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids the male and female chicks may be differentiated by color). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a ''[[Comb (anatomy)|comb or cockscomb]]'', and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called ''[[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]''. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
A ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].

Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

Chickens are [[Social|gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flock]]s. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "[[pecking order]]", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens—especially younger birds—to an existing flock can lead to violence and injury.<ref>{{cite web|author=by Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock « Musings from a Stonehead |publisher=Stonehead.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

Hens will try to lay in nests that already contain eggs, and have been known to move eggs from neighboring nests into their own. Some farmers use fake eggs made from plastic or stone (or [[golf ball]]s) to encourage hens to lay in a particular location. The result of this behavior is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.

Hens can also be extremely stubborn about always laying in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.

Roosters crowing (a loud and sometimes shrill call) is a territorial signal to other roosters. However, crowing may also result from sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give a low "warning call" when they think they see a predator approaching.

In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds "turned on" a chicken [[recessive gene]], ''talpid2'', and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have "...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions..."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1666805 Scientists Find Chickens Retain Ancient Ability to Grow Teeth] Ammu Kannampilly, [[ABC News]], 2006-02-27. Retrieved 2007-10-01.</ref>

==Food sharing and courting==
When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behavior may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.

To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering his wing which is closest to the hen.<ref name="grandin69">{{cite book |title= Animals in Translation|last= Grandin|first= Temple|authorlink= Temple Grandin|coauthors= Johnson, Catherine|year= 2005|publisher= Scribner|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0743247698|page= |pages= |url=69-71 }}</ref>  The dance triggers a response in the hen's brain,<ref name="grandin69"/> and when the hen responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the fertilization.

==Breeding==
===Origins===
The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the [[Red Junglefowl]] (''Gallus gallus'') and is scientifically classified as the same species.<ref name=nature>[http://www.nature.com.prxy5.ursus.maine.edu/nature/journal/v432/n7018/full/nature03156.html#abs A genetic variation map for chicken with 2.8 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms].

Researchers have found chickens' bones in unusual amounts and out of natural jungle range, thus denoting a breeding place. Bones of domestic chickens from about 6000-4000 BC have been found in Yangshao and Peiligan, China, from a time when the Holocene climate was not naturally suitable for the ''Gallus'' species.<ref>CHOF, p496, citing West & Zhou, 1988</ref> Archaeological data is lacking for Thailand and southeast Asia.

Later traces are found about 3000-2000 BC in [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo-Daro]], Pakistan,<ref>CHOF, p496, citing Zeuner 1963, Crawford 1984</ref> and -according to linguistic researchers- in Austronesian populations traveling across southeast Asia and Oceania. A northern road spread chicken to the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim basin]] of central Asia, modern day Iran. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000BC, and the [[Indus Valley]] about 2500 BC.<ref name="CHOF">CHOF : The Cambridge History of Food, 2000, [[Cambridge University Press]], vol.1,  pp496-499</ref>
Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts, to Iberia. Breeding increased under the [[Roman Empire]], and was reduced in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="CHOF" />
Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in [[Syria]]; chicken went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. The chicken reached [[Egypt]] for purposes of [[cock fighting]] about 1400BC, and became widely bred only in [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] Egypt (about 300 BC).<ref name="CHOF" /> Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa. Three possible ways of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian [[Nile River|Nile]] Valley,  the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]]. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and [[South Africa]] and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.<ref name="CHOF" />
Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chicken, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.<ref name="CHOF" />

A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by [[extinction]] may also help with research into this area.<ref name="CHOF" />

===Current===	
[[File:Chicken eggs.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken [[egg (biology)|eggs]] vary in color depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) ([[Araucana]] varieties).]]

[[File:Embryo.ogv|thumb|right|Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo]]
Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs.  Many domestic hens will also do this–and are then said to "go broody".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe.  While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation.  To stimulate broodiness, an owner may place many artificial eggs in the nest, or to stop it they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.
 		
At the end of the incubation period (about 21 days),<ref name="grandin69"/> the eggs, if fertile, will hatch.  Development of the egg starts only when incubation begins, so they all hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by "pipping"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  It will then rest for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  It then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  It crawls out of the remaining shell, and its wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest.

[[File:Day old chick black background.jpg|thumb|A day-old chick]]
The hen will usually stay on the nest for about two days after the first egg hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks live off the egg yolk they absorb just before hatching.  Any eggs not fertilized by a rooster will not hatch, and the hen eventually loses interest in these and leaves the nest.  After hatching, the hen fiercely guards the chicks, and will brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water; she will call them to edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old, when she will gradually lose interest and eventually start to lay again.
 		
Modern egg-laying breeds rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, some "utility" (general purpose) breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s or [[Goose|geese]].  Chicken eggs can also be hatched under a broody duck, with varied success.

==Poultry farming==
{{main|Poultry farming}}
[[File:Rooster04 adjusted.jpg|thumb|A [[Pastured poultry|free range rooster]] on a farm]]
More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of food, for both their meat and their eggs. Chickens farmed for meat are called broiler chickens, whilst those farmed for eggs are called egg-laying hens. In total, the UK alone consumes over 29 million eggs per day. Some hens can produce over 300 eggs a year. Chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years, but broiler chickens typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size. For laying hens, they are slaughtered after about 12 months, when the hens' productivity starts to decline.

The vast majority of poultry are raised using intensive farming techniques. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat, and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.[3] One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free range farming.

Friction between these two main methods has led to long term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane. Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources due to increased productivity, stating that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.

==Artificial incubation==
[[File:Egg incubator.jpg|thumb|right|An egg incubator.]]
Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2104/ANSI-8100web.pdf | author=Joe G.

Clauer |title=Incubating Eggs |publisher=Virginia Cooperative Extension Service, Virginia State University |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.brinsea.com/pdffiles/Brinsea_Handbook.pdf| title=Incubation Handbook|publisher=Brinsea Products Ltd|date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backyardchickens.com/LC-hatch.html | title=How To Hatch Chicken Eggs|publisher=www.backyardchickens.com|date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator. Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1°[[Fahrenheit|F]] from the optimum temperature of 99.5 °[[Fahrenheit|F]] (37.5 °[[Celsius|C]]) will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.

Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from half a dozen to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.

==Chicken eggs as food==
{{Main|Egg (food)|List of egg dishes}}
[[Image:Brown_chicken_eggs.jpg|right|thumb|Brown chicken eggs.]]
[[Image:Fried egg, sunny side up.jpg|right|thumb|A fried chicken egg, "sunny side up".]]
Chicken eggs are widely used in many types of dishes, both sweet and savory, including many [[baking|baked goods]]. Eggs can be scrambled, fried, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, [[pickling|pickled]], and poached. The [[albumen]], or egg white, contains protein but little or no [[fat]], and can be used in cooking separately from the yolk. Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light, fluffy consistency and are often used in desserts such as [[meringue]]s and [[mousse]]. Ground egg shells are sometimes used as a [[food additive]] to deliver [[calcium]]. Some people prefer to just have a female, and raise it for the eggs.

==Chickens as food==
{{Main|Chicken (food)}}
[[File:Roasted chicken.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roasting|Roasted]] chicken.]]
The [[meat]] of the chicken, also called "chicken", is a type of [[Breast meat|poultry meat]]. Because of its relatively low cost, chicken is one of the most used meats in the world.  Nearly all parts of  the bird can be used for food, and the meat can be cooked in many different ways. Popular chicken dishes include roasted chicken, [[fried chicken]], [[chicken soup]], [[Buffalo wings]], [[tandoori chicken]], [[butter chicken]], and [[Hainanese chicken rice|chicken rice]]. Chicken is also a staple of many [[fast food]] restaurants.

==Chickens as pets==
{{main|Chickens as pets}}
Chickens are sometimes kept as [[pet]]s and can be tamed by hand feeding, but roosters can sometimes become aggressive and noisy. Some have advised against keeping them around very young children. Certain breeds, however, such as silkies and many bantam varieties are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henkeeping.co.uk/which.html | title = Clucks and Chooks: A guide to keeping chickens}}</ref>

==Chicken diseases and ailments==
Chickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worm]]s, as well as other diseases.  Despite the name, they are not affected by [[chickenpox]], which is generally restricted to humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11556693 | title=An animal model of varicella virus infection | author = White TM, Gilden DH, Mahalingam R. | accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref>

==Chickens in religion and mythology==
In [[Indonesia]] the chicken has great significance during the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[cremation]] ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the [[leg]] and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present during the ceremony go into the chicken and not the family members present. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.

In [[ancient Greece]], the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were "[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?", signifying that [[death]] was a cure for the illness of life.

The Greeks believed that even [[lion]]s were afraid of cocks. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: "Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'" ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34) Thus it happened ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61), and Peter cried bitterly. This made the cock a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.

Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing." ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34).

In many [[Central Europe]]an [[folk tale]]s, the [[devil]] is believed to flee at the first crowing of a cock.

In traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called [[kapparos]]. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A [[woman]] brings a hen for the ceremony, while a [[man]] brings a rooster. Although not actually a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in [[God]]'s hands.

The [[Talmud]] speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's mate" from the rooster. This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.

The chicken is one of the [[Zodiac]] symbols of the [[Chinese calendar]]. Also in [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. [[Vegetarian]] deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not one of the recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with "serious" prayer (while roasted [[pork]] is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese [[Wedding]]s, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g. sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red [[silk]] scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today.

A [[cockatrice]] was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a Rooster's call.

==Chickens in history==
[[File:Red junglefowl hm.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Red Junglefowl]]]]
An early domestication of chickens in [[Southeast Asia]] is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (''*manuk'') is part of the reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language]] (see [[Austronesian languages]]). Chickens, together with dogs and [[pig]]s, were the domestic animals of the [[Lapita]] culture, the first [[Neolithic]] culture of [[Oceania]].

The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on [[Corinth, Greece|Corinthian]] [[pottery]] of the 7th century BC. The poet [[Cratinus]] (mid-5th century BC, according to the later Greek author [[Athenaeus]]) calls the chicken "the [[Iran|Persia]]n alarm". In [[Aristophanes]]'s comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' (414 BC) a chicken is called "the [[Medes|Median]] bird", which points to an introduction from the East. Pictures of chickens are found on Greek [[red-figure pottery|red figure]] and [[black-figure pottery]].

In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for [[Symposium|symposia]]. [[Delos]] seems to have been a center of chicken breeding.

The [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s used chickens for oracles, both when flying ("ex avibus", [[Augury]]) and when feeding ("auspicium ex tripudiis", [[Alectryomancy]]). The hen ("gallina") gave a favourable omen ("auspicium ratum"), when appearing from the left (Cic.,de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl.

For the oracle "ex tripudiis" according to [[Cicero]] (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used, but normally only chickens ("pulli") were consulted. The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises ("occinerent"), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.

Chickens were spread by [[Polynesia]]n seafarers and reached [[Easter Island]] in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the [[Polynesian Rat]] (''Rattus exulans''). They were housed in extremely solid [[chicken coop]]s built from stone.

In 249 BC, the Roman general [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]] had his chickens thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the [[battle of Drepana]], saying "If they won't eat, perhaps they will drink." He promptly lost the battle against the [[Carthaginian]]s and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.

In 161 BC, a law was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the [[recipe]]s include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty "tail" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).

The Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in his eighth book of his treatise on [[agriculture]]. He identifies Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks. For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks. Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.

Per Columella, the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings.

Per Columella, chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals. Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.

According to Columella, chicken should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lollium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.

Columella advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, because they no longer produce sufficient eggs.

Capons were produced by burning out their spurs with a hot iron. The wound was treated with potter's chalk.

For the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient Rome see [[Roman eating and drinking]].

==Chickens in South America==
An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in [[South America]] is the [[araucana]], bred in southern [[Chile]] by [[Mapuche]] people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they predate the arrival of European chickens brought by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and are evidence of [[pre-Columbian]] trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south central Chile. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070604/full/447620b.html DNA reveals how the chicken crossed the sea] Brendan Borrell, Nature, 5 June 2007. Retrieved 2007-10-01.</ref> These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.<ref>A. A. Storey et al., "Radiocarbon and DNA evidence for a pre-Columbian introduction of Polynesian chickens to Chile", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0703993104; John Noble Wilford, "First Chickens in Americas were Brought from Polynesia, ''[[New York Times]]'', June 5, 2007</ref>

However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:
<blockquote>
A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.<ref>''Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean
and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA.'' Jaime Gongora, Nicolas J. Rawlence, Victor A. Mobegi, Han Jianlin, Jose A. Alcalde, Jose T. Matus, Olivier Hanotte, Chris Moran, J.
