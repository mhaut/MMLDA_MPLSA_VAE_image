The '''Bosnian War''' or the '''War in Bosnia and Herzegovina''' was an international [[armed conflict]] that took place in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] between April 1992 and December 1995. The war involved several sides. The main belligerents were the forces of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and those of the self-proclaimed [[Bosnian Serb]] and [[Bosnian Croat]] entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]. Republika Srpska and Herzeg-Bosnia enjoyed substantial political and military backing from [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web|year=|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882595|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|year=|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882594|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Croatia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|year=|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf|title=ICJ: The genocide case: Bosnia v.

The war came about as a result of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[Slovenia]]n and Croatian secessions from [[Yugoslavia]] in 1991, the multiethnic Yugoslavian republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was inhabited by mainly [[Muslim]] [[Bosniaks]] (44 per cent), [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] (31 per cent) and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Croats]] (17 per cent), passed a [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|referendum for independence]] on February 29, 1992. This was rejected by Bosnian Serb political representatives, who had boycotted the referendum and established their own republic of Republika Srpska. Following the declaration of [[independence]], Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the [[Serbian government]] of [[Slobodan Milošević]] and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) attacked the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure Serbian territory and war soon broke out across Bosnia, accompanied by the ethnic cleansing of the Bosniak population, especially in Eastern Bosnia.<ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement - Foča">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC|title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements}}</ref>

It was principally a territorial conflict, initially between the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which was largely though not exclusively composed of Bosniaks, and Bosnian Croat forces on the one side, and Bosnian Serb forces on the other. The Croats also aimed at securing parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Croatian.<ref name="ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict - A.

Penguin Books, p.185</ref> The war was characterized by bitter fighting, indiscriminate shelling of cities and towns, [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Rape in the Bosnian War|systematic mass rape]] and [[Bosnian Genocide|genocide]]. Events such as the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], [[Omarska camp]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre]] would come to typify the conflict.

The Serbs, although initially superior due to the vast amount of weapons and resources provided by the JNA eventually lost momentum as Bosniaks and Croats allied themselves against Republika Srpska in 1994 with the creation of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] following the [[Washington agreement]]. Following the Srebrenica and [[Markale massacres]], [[NATO]] intervened during the 1995 [[Operation Deliberate Force]] against the positions of the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which internationalized the conflict, but only in its final stages.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3459965.stm Sarajevo massacre remembered]</ref>  The war was brought to an end after the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina in Paris on 14 December 1995.

==Breakup of Yugoslavia==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2009}}
{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Timeline of Yugoslavian breakup}}
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina came about as a result of the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]]. Crisis emerged in Yugoslavia with the weakening of the Communist system at the end of the [[Cold War]]. In Yugoslavia, the national Communist party, officially called Alliance or [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], was losing its ideological potency, while the [[nationalist]] and [[separatist]] ideologies were on the rise in the late 1980s. This was particularly noticeable in [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and to a lesser extent in [[Slovenia]] and [[Republic of Macedonia]].

In March 1989, the crisis in Yugoslavia deepened after adoption of amendments to the Serbian constitution that allowed the government of the Serbian republic to impose effective power over the autonomous provinces of [[Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]]. Until that point, their decision-making had been independent. Each also had a vote at the Yugoslav federal level. Serbia, under President [[Slobodan Milošević]], thus gained control over three out of eight votes in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] presidency. With additional votes from [[Montenegro]], Serbia was thus able to heavily influence decisions of the federal government. This situation led to objections in other republics and calls for reform of the Yugoslav Federation.

At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, on 20 January 1990, the delegations of the republics could not agree on the main issues in the Yugoslav federation. As a result, the [[Slovenia]]n and Croatian delegates left the Congress. The Slovenian delegation, headed by [[Milan Kučan]] demanded democratic changes and a looser federation, while the Serbian delegation, headed by Milošević, opposed it. This is considered the beginning of the end of [[Yugoslavia]].

Moreover, nationalist parties attained power in other republics. Among them, the Croatian [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s [[Croatian Democratic Union]] was the most prominent. On December 22, 1990, the [[Parliament of Croatia]] adopted the new Constitution, taking away some of the rights of the Serbs granted by the previous [[Socialist]] constitution. This created grounds for nationalist action among the indigenous Serbs of Croatia. Closely following the adoption of the new constitution, Slovenia and Croatia began the process towards independence, which led to a [[Ten-Day War|short armed conflict in Slovenia]], and [[Croatian War of Independence|all-out war in Croatia]] in areas with substantial Serb populations.

==The pre-war situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina==

Bosnia and Herzegovina has historically been a multi-ethnic state. According to the 1991 census, 44 per cent of the population considered themselves Muslim (Bosniak), 31 per cent Serb and 17 per cent Croat, with 6 per cent describing themselves as Yugoslav.<ref name=Sourcebook>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ORSMBFwjAKcC&pg=PA311#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The former Yugoslavia's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook|first1=Matjaž|last1=Klemenčič|first2=Mitja|last2=Žagar|year=2004|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=311|isbn=1576072940}}</ref>

In the first multi-party election that took place in November 1990 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the three largest nationalist parties in the country won, the [[Party of Democratic Action]], the [[Serbian Democratic Party]] and the [[Croatian Democratic Union]].<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=rN5bt0iMYuoC&pg=PA220</ref>

Parties divided the power along the ethnic lines so that the President of the Presidency of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was a Bosniak, president of the Parliament was a [[Serb]] and the prime minister a Croat.

Following the declaration of [[independence]] of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs from B&H with support from Serbia, attacked different parts of the country. The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory. The Serbs wanted all lands where Serbs had a majority, eastern and western Bosnia. The Croats and their leader [[Franjo Tuđman]] also aimed at securing parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Croatian. The policies of the Republic of Croatia and its leader Franjo Tuđman towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were never totally transparent and always included Franjo Tuđman's ultimate aim of expanding Croatia's borders.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=NlRD4yaHrEYC&pg=PA279</ref> Bosniaks were an easy target, because the Bosnian government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war.<ref name="ICTY: Naletilić and Matinović verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/naletilic_martinovic/cis/en/cis_naletilic_martinovic_en.pdf|title=ICTY: Naletilić and Matinović verdict}}</ref>

===Establishment of the "Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia"===

The objectives of [[nationalist]]s from Croatia were shared by Croat nationalists in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="ICTY: Blaškić verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blaskic/acjug/en/bla-aj040729e.pdf|title=ICTY: Blaškić verdict}}</ref> The ruling party in the [[Republic of Croatia]], the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), organized and controlled the branch of the party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the latter part of 1991, the more extreme elements of the party, under the leadership of [[Mate Boban]], [[Dario Kordić]], [[Jadranko Prlić]], Ignac Koštroman and local leaders such as Anto Valenta,<ref name="ICTY: Blaškić verdict" /> and with the support of [[Franjo Tuđman]] and [[Gojko Šušak]], had taken effective control of the party. This coincided with the peak of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. On November 18, 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina, proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]], as a separate "political, cultural, economic and territorial whole", on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/prlic/cis/en/cis_prlic_al_en.pdf|title=ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić}}</ref>

The [[Serb]] members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serb Democratic Party]] members, but also including some other party representatives (which would form the "[[Independent Members of Parliament Caucus]]"), abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on October 24, 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=_RSi4WL0RP8C&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12</ref> This assembly established the [[Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on January 9, 1992, which became Republika Srpska in August 1992.<ref name="books.google.com">http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzYznOEiZmcC&pg=PP1137</ref>

===Independence referendum in Bosnia and Herzegovina===
After Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1991, Bosnia and Herzegovina organized a referendum on independence as well. The decision of the Parliament of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on holding the referendum was taken after the majority of [[Serb]] members had left the assembly in protest. Since the Constitution required a consensus between representatives of the three peoples ([[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]], and [[Croats]]) for such a decision, the Bosnian Serbs considered the referendum unconstitutional and illegal.

The Bosnian Serb assembly members invited the [[Serb]] population to boycott the referendums held on February 29 and March 1, 1992. The turnout to the referendums was reported as 63.4 per cent, with 99.7 per cent of voters voting in favour of independence (indicating that Bosnian Serbs, which made up approximately 34% of the population, largely boycotted the referendum).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=UserGroups.Home&ContentRecord_id=250&ContentType=G&ContentRecordType=G&UserGroup_id=5&Subaction=ByDate|title=The Referendum on Independence in Bosnia-Herzegovina: February 29-March 1, 1992|year=1992|publisher=Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|page=19|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> Independence was declared on March 5, 1992 by the parliament. The referendums were utilized by the Serb political leadership as a reason to start roadblocks in protest.

===Carrington-Cutileiro Plan===
The [[Lisbon Agreement]], also known as the Carrington-Cutileiro plan, named for its creators Lord [[Peter Carrington]] and Portuguese Ambassador [[José Cutileiro]], resulted from the [[European Economic Community|EEC]]-hosted conference held in September 1991 in an attempt to prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina sliding into war. It proposed ethnic power-sharing on all administrative levels and the devolution of central government to local ethnic communities. However, all Bosnia and Herzegovina's districts would be classified as Bosniak, Serb or Croat under the plan, even where ethnic majority was not evident.

On March 18, 1992, all three sides signed the agreement; [[Alija Izetbegović]] for the Bosniaks, [[Radovan Karadžić]] for the Serbs and [[Mate Boban]] for the Croats.

However, on March 28, 1992, Izetbegović, after meeting with then US ambassador to Yugoslavia [[Warren Zimmermann]] in Sarajevo, withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any type of ethnic division of Bosnia.

:'' What was said and by whom remains unclear. Zimmerman denies that he told Izetbegovic that if he withdrew his signature, the United States would grant recognition to Bosnia as an independent state. What is indisputable is that Izetbegovic, that same day, withdrew his signature and renounced the agreement''.<ref>{{cite web

===Arms embargo===
On September 25, 1991 the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 713|Resolution 713]] imposing an arms embargo on all of former Yugoslavia. The embargo hurt the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] the most because [[Serbia]] inherited the lion's share of the former JNA arsenal and the Croatian army could smuggle weapons through its coast. Over 55 per cent of the armories and barracks of the former Yugoslavia were located in Bosnia owing to its mountainous terrain, in anticipation of a guerrilla war, but many of those factories were under Serbian control (such as the UNIS PRETIS factory in [[Vogošća]]), and others were inoperable due to a lack of electricity and raw materials. The Bosnian government lobbied to have the embargo lifted but that was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and Russia. US proposals to pursue this policy were known as [[Lift and strike (Bosnia)|lift and strike]]. The US congress passed two resolutions calling for the embargo to be lifted but both were vetoed by President [[Bill Clinton]] for fear of creating a rift between the US and the aforementioned countries. Nonetheless, the United States used both "[[black operation|black]]" C-130 transports and [[back channel]]s including [[Islamist]] groups to smuggle weapons to the Bosnian government forces via Croatia.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,688310,00.html UK Guardian: America used Islamists to arm the Bosnian Muslims]</ref>

The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) officially left Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 12, 1992 shortly after independence was declared in April 1992. However, most of the command chain, weaponry, and higher ranked military personnel, including general [[Ratko Mladić]], remained in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. The Croats organized a defensive military formation of their own called the [[Croatian Defense Council]] (''Hrvatsko Vijeće Obrane'', HVO) as the armed forces of the self-proclaimed [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]. The Bosniaks mostly organized into the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine'', Armija RBiH). Initially, this army had a number of non-Bosniaks (around 25 per cent), especially in the 1st Corps in Sarajevo. [[Sefer Halilović]], the Chief of Staff of the Bosnian Territorial Defense, claimed in June 1992 that his forces were 70 per cent Muslim, 18 per cent Croat and 12 per cent Serb.<ref name=Kozar>{{cite news|url=http://www.ex-yupress.com/oslob/oslob7.html|title=Croats and Serbs are (un)suitable|work=Oslobodenje-Svijet|first=Duro|last=Kozar|date=2 August 1996|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> The percentage of Serb and Croat soldiers in the Bosnian army was particularly high in cities such as Sarajevo, Mostar and Tuzla.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=04zV4pqEhLkC&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Through Bosnian Eyes: The Political Memoir of a Bosnian Serb|first=Mirko|last=Pejanović|year=2004|location=West Lafayette|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=1557533598|page=86}}</ref> The deputy commander of the Bosnian Army's Headquarters, was general [[Jovan Divjak]], the highest ranking ethnic Serb in the Bosnian Army.

Various paramilitary units were operating in the Bosnian war: the Serb "[[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]]" (''[[White Eagles (paramilitary)|Beli Orlovi]]''), [[Arkan]]'s "Tigers", "[[Serbian Volunteer Guard]]" (''Srpska Dobrovoljačka Garda''), Bosnians "[[Patriotic League]]" (''Patriotska Liga'') and "[[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]]" (''Zelene Beretke''), and Croatian "Croatian Defense Forces" (''Hrvatske Obrambene Snage''), etc. The Serb and Croat paramilitaries involved volunteers from Serbia and Croatia, and were supported by nationalist political parties in those countries. Allegations exist about the involvement of the Serbian and Croatian secret police in the conflict. Forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were divided in 5 corps'. 1st Corps operated in the region of Sarajevo and Gorazde while a stronger 5th Corps was positioned in the western [[Bosanska Krajina]] pocket, which cooperated with HVO units in and around [[Bihać]].

Some radical Western fighters as well as numerous individuals from the cultural area of Western Christianity fought as volunteers for the Croats including [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] volunteers from Germany and Austria. Swedish [[Neo-Nazi]] [[Jackie Arklöv]] was charged with war crimes upon his return to Sweden.

The Bosnians received support from Muslim groups. According to some US NGO reports, there were also several hundred [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Iranian Revolutionary Guards]] assisting the Bosnian government during the war.<ref>[http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/early/dayton_imp/train_equip.html United States Institute of Peace], Dayton Implementation: The Train and Equip Program, September 1997 | Special Report No. 25</ref>

At the outset of the Bosnian war, [[Serb]] forces attacked the Bosnian Muslim civilian population in eastern Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010|reason=For entire paragraph.}} Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces - military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers – applied the same pattern: houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men massacred or detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centers where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, where they were mistreated in many ways including being raped repeatedly. Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them.<ref name="ICTY: Stanković and Janković judgement">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/stankovic/cis/en/cis_jankovic_stankovic_en.pdf|title=ICTY: Blagojevic and Jokic judgement}}</ref><ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/acjug/en/kun-aj020612e.pdf|title=ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement}}</ref> The Serbs had the upper hand due to heavier weaponry (despite less manpower) that was given to them by the Yugoslav People's Army and established control over most areas where Serbs had relative majority but also in areas where they were a significant minority in both rural and urban regions excluding the larger towns of Sarajevo and [[Mostar]]. The [[Serb]] military and political leaders, from ICTY received the most accusations of [[war crimes]] many of which have been confirmed after the war in ICTY trials.

Most of the capital [[Sarajevo]] was predominantly held by the Bosniaks, although the official Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina government continued to function in its relative multi-ethnic capacity. In the 44 months of the siege, terror against Sarajevo residents varied in intensity, but the purpose remained the same: inflict suffering on civilians to force the Bosnian authorities to accept Serb demands.<ref name="ICTY: Greatest suffering at least risk">{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&pid=9043&kat=3|title=ICTY: Greatest suffering at least risk}}</ref> The [[Army of Republika Srpska]] surrounded it (alternatively, the Serb forces situated themselves in the areas surrounding Sarajevo the so-called Ring around Sarajevo), deploying troops and artillery in the surrounding hills in what would become the longest siege in the history of modern warfare lasting nearly 4 years. See [[Siege of Sarajevo]].

Numerous cease-fire agreements were signed, and breached again when one of the sides felt it was to their advantage. The [[United Nations]] repeatedly, but unsuccessfully attempted to stop the war and the much-touted [[Peace plans offered before and during the Bosnian War#Vance-Owen|Vance-Owen Peace Plan]] made little impact.

The first casualty in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a point of contention between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. Bosniaks and Croats consider the first casualties of the war after the independence declaration to be [[Suada Dilberović]] and [[Olga Sučić]], who were shot during a peace march by unidentified Serb gunmen on April 5 in a Holiday Inn hotel under the control of the [[Serbian Democratic Party]].<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=ACvJHam2_-oC&pg=PA284</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Rx-1MdUlzaUC&pg=RA1-PA221</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=xWKjSc0ql3cC&pg=PA190</ref> Serbs consider Nikola Gardović, a groom's father who was killed at a Serb wedding procession on the second day of the referendum, on March 1, 1992 in Sarajevo's old town [[Baščaršija]], to be the first victim of the war.<ref>http://books.google.ca/books?id=ACvJHam2_-oC&lpg=PA291&ots=E3y7XK_f5A&dq=Nikola%20Gardovi%C4%87&pg=PA291#v=onepage&q=&f=false</ref>

On September 19, 1991, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) moved extra troops to the area around the city of [[Mostar]], which was publicly protested by the local government. On October 13, 1991 future president of Republika Srpska, [[Radovan Karadžić]] expressed his view about future of Bosnia and Bosnian Muslims: ''"In just a couple of days, Sarajevo will be gone and there will be five hundred thousand dead, in one month Muslims will be annihilated in Bosnia and Herzegovina".'' <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinki.org.rs/hcharter_t16a02.html | publisher = [[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia]] | work = Helsinki Charter No. 109-110 | date = July 2007 | author = [[Florence Hartmann]] | title = A statement at the seventh biennal meeting of the International Association of Genocide Scholars | accessdate = 2010-12-31}}</ref>

On January 7, 1992, the Serb members of the Prijedor Municipal Assembly and the presidents of the local Municipal Boards of the [[Serbian Democratic Party|SDS]] proclaimed the Assembly of the Serbian People of the Municipality of Prijedor and implemented secret instructions that were issued earlier on December 19, 1991. The "''Organisation and Activity of Organs of the Serbian People in Bosnia and Herzegovina in Extraordinary Circumstances''" provided a plan for the SDS take-over of municipalities in BiH, it also included plans for the creation of Crisis Staffs.<ref name="sim.law.uu.nl">http://sim.law.uu.nl/sim/caselaw/tribunalen.nsf/db2e2884b11f7cbbc125720a007af60b/8cc6f2501fe7c551c12571fe004d31cd?OpenDocument</ref> [[Milomir Stakić]], later convicted by [[ICTY]] of mass [[crimes against humanity]] against Bosniak and Croat [[civilian]]s, was elected President of this Assembly. Ten days later, on January 17, 1992, the Assembly endorsed joining the Serbian territories of the Municipality of Prijedor to the Autonomous Region of Bosnian Krajina in order to create a separate Serbian state in ethnic Serbian territories.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/stakic/tjug/en/stak-tj030731e.pdf|title=ICTY: Milomir Stakić judgement}}</ref>

On 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly adopted a declaration proclaiming the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ("SR BiH").<ref name="books.google.com" />  On 28 February 1992, the Constitution of the SR BiH declared that the territory of that Republic included "the territories of the Serbian Autonomous Regions and Districts and of other Serbian ethnic entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the regions in which the Serbian people remained in the minority due to the genocide conducted against it in World War II", and it was declared to be a part of Yugoslavia. On 12 August 1992, the name of the SR BiH was changed to Republika Srpska ("RS").<ref name="sim.law.uu.nl" />

During the months of March–April–May 1992 fierce attacks raged in eastern Bosnia as well as the northwestern part of the country. In March attacks by the SDS leaders, together with field officers of the Second Military Command of former JNA, were conducted in eastern part of the country with the objective to take strategically relevant positions and carry out a communication and information blockade. Attacks carried out resulted in a large number of dead and wounded civilians.<ref name=CCPR>CCPR Human Rights Committee. "Bosnia and Herzegovina Report".

=====1992 ethnic cleansing campaign in Eastern Bosnia=====
{{Main|Foča massacre|Višegrad massacres}}

Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces - military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers – applied the same pattern: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps.<ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement" />

=====Prijedor region=====
{{Main|Prijedor massacre}}

On April 23, 1992, the [[Serbian Democratic Party|SDS]] decided ''[[inter alia]]'' that all Serb units immediately start working on the takeover of the Prijedor municipality in co-ordination with JNA. By the end of April 1992, a number of clandestine Serb police stations were created in the municipality and more than 1,500 armed Serbs were ready to take part in the takeover.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" />

[[Image:Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars.png|thumb|right|Territories of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republic of Croatia]] under control of Serbian forces. The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|War Crimes Tribual]] accused [[Slobodan Milošević]] of "attempting to create a ''[[Greater Serbia]]'', a [[Serbia]]n state encompassing the [[Serb]]-populated areas of [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia]], and achieved by [[Deportation|forcibly removing]] non-Serbs from large geographical areas through the commission of the [[crime]]s.<ref>Decision of the ICTY Appeals Chamber; 18 April 2002; Reasons for the Decision on Prosecution Interlocutory Appeal from Refusal to Order Joinder; Paragraph 8</ref>]]

A declaration on the [[takeover]] prepared by the Serb politicians from SDS was read out on Radio Prijedor the day after the takeover and was repeated throughout the day. In the night of the April 29/30, 1992, the takeover of power took place. Employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. Only Serbs were present and some of them were wearing military uniforms. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. Each group of about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one for the bank and the last for the post-office.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" />

Serb authorities set up [[concentration camps]] and determined who should be responsible for the running of those camps.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" /> [[Keraterm camp|Keraterm]] factory was set up as a camp on or around May 23/24, 1992.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" /> The [[Omarska camp|Omarska]] [[mining|mine]]s complex was located about 20&nbsp;km from the town of Prijedor. The first detainees were taken to the camp sometime in late May 1992 (between 26 and 30 May). According to the Serb authorities documents from Prijedor, there were a total of 3,334 persons held in the camp from May 27 to August 16, 1992. 3,197 of them were Bosniaks (i.e. Bosnian Muslims), 125 were Croats.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" /> The Trnoplje camp was set up in the village of Trnoplje on May 24, 1992. The camp was guarded on all sides by the Serb army. There were [[machine-gun]] nests and well-armed posts pointing their [[gun]]s towards the camp. There were several thousand people detained in the camp, the vast majority of whom were Bosnian Muslim and some of them were Croats.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" />

[[ICTY]] concluded that the takeover by the Serb politicians was as an illegal [[coup d'état]], which was planned and coordinated a long time in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by the Serb police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was [[Milomir Stakić]], who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the Municipality.<ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakic judgement" />

[[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] under control of Serbia was able to take over at least 60 per cent of the country before 19 May official withdrawn all officers and troops that are not from Bosnia .<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DF1F3BF931A25756C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 Pessimism Is Overshadowing Hope In Effort to End Yugoslav Fighting]</ref> Much of this is due to the fact that they were much better armed and organized than the Bosniak and Bosnian Croat forces. Attacks also included areas of mixed ethnic composition. [[Doboj]], [[Foča]], [[Rogatica]], [[Vlasenica]], [[Bratunac]], [[Zvornik]], [[Prijedor]], [[Sanski Most]], [[Kljuc]], [[Brčko (city)|Brčko]], [[Derventa]], [[Modrica]], [[Bosanska Krupa]], [[Bosanski Brod]], [[Bosanski Novi]], [[Glamoc]], [[Bosanski Petrovac]], [[Cajnice]], [[Bijeljina]], [[Višegrad]], and parts of [[Sarajevo]] are all areas where Serbs established control and expelled Bosniaks and Croats. Also areas in that were more ethnically homogeneous and were spared from major fighting such as [[Banja Luka]], [[Bosanska Dubica]], [[Bosanska Gradiska]], [[Bileca]], [[Gacko]], [[Han Pijesak]], [[Kalinovik]], [[Nevesinje]], [[Trebinje]], [[Rudo]] saw their non-Serb populations expelled. Similarly, the regions of central Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Sarajevo]], [[Zenica]], [[Maglaj]], [[Zavidovici]], [[Bugojno]], [[Mostar]], [[Konjic]], etc.) saw the flight of its Serb population, migrating to the Serb-held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In June 1992, the [[UNPROFOR|United Nations Protection Force]] originally deployed in Croatia had its mandate extended into Bosnia and Herzegovina, initially to protect the [[Sarajevo International Airport]]. In September, the role of the UNPROFOR was expanded to protect humanitarian aid and assist relief delivery in the whole Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to help protect civilian refugees when required by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]].

=====The Croat Defence Council take-overs in Central Bosnia=====

Pressured and contained by heavily armed Serb forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, the major Croat force - the HVO (Croatian Defence Council) shifted their focus from defending their parts of Bosnia from Serbs to trying to capture remaining territory held by Bosnian Army. It is widely believed that this was due to the [[Karađorđevo agreement]] (March 1991) reached between presidents [[Slobodan Milošević]] and [[Franjo Tuđman]] to split Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia.

To accomplish this, HVO forces would have to both quell dissent from the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) armed group and defeat the Bosnian Army, since the territory that they wanted was under Bosnian government control. HVO with great engagement from the Military of Republic of Croatia and material support from Serbs,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} attacked Bosniak civilian population in Herzegovina and in central Bosnia starting an ethnic cleansing of Bosniak populated territories.

The [[Graz agreement]] of May 1992 caused deep division inside the Croat community and strengthened the separation group, which led to the conflict with Bosniaks. One of the primary pro-union Croat leaders was [[Blaž Kraljević]], the leader of the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) armed group, which also had a Croatian nationalist agenda but unlike HVO it fully supported cooperation with the Bosniaks.

In June 1992 the focus switched to [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Gornji Vakuf]] where the Croat Defence Council (HVO) efforts to gain control were resisted.

On June 18, 1992 the Bosnian Territorial Defence in [[Novi Travnik]] received an [[ultimatum]] from the HVO that included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions, establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it, subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees, all within 24 hours. The attack was launched on June 19. The elementary school and the Post Office were attacked and damaged.<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kordic_cerkez/tjug/en/kor-tj010226e.pdf|title=ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict}}</ref> Gornji Vakuf was initially attacked by Croats on June 20, 1992, but the attack failed. (See: [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing]])
Vastly underequipped Bosnian forces, fighting on two fronts, were able to repel Croats and gain territory against them on every front. At this time, due to its geographic position, Bosnia was surrounded by Croat and Serb forces from all sides. There was no way to import weapons or food. What saved Bosnia at this time was its vast Industrial complex (Steel and Heavy Industries) that was able to switch to military hardware production.

In August 1992, HOS leader [[Blaž Kraljević]] was killed by HVO soldiers, which severely weakened the moderate group who hoped to keep the alliance between Bosniaks and Croats alive.<ref>''Sarajevo, i poslije'', Erich Rathfelder, [[München]] 1998 [http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti/201129erra.htm]</ref>

The situation became more serious in October 1992 when Croat forces attacked Bosniak civilian population in [[Prozor]] burning their homes and killing civilians. According to ''[[Jadranko Prlić]] indictment'', HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages.<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić" />

In October 1992 the Serbs captured the town of [[Jajce]] and expelled the Croat and Bosniak population. The fall of the town was largely due to a lack of Bosniak-Croat cooperation and rising tensions, especially over the previous four months.

On January 8, 1993 the Serbs killed the deputy [[prime minister]] of Bosnia [[Hakija Turajlić]] after stopping the UN convoy taking him from the airport. On May 15–16 96 per cent of Serbs voted to reject the Vance-Owen plan. After the failure of the Vance-Owen peace plan, which practically intended to divide the country into three ethnic parts, an armed conflict sprung between Bosniaks and Croats over the 30 per cent of Bosnia they held. The peace plan was one of the factors leading to the [[escalation]] of the conflict, as [[Lord Owen]] avoided moderate Croat authorities (pro-unified Bosnia) and negotiated directly with more extreme elements (which were for separation).<ref>[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/cats/yugoslavia/xd20-0.htm Angus Macqueen and Paul Mitchell, The Death of Yugoslavia]</ref>

Much of 1993 was dominated by the [[Croat-Bosniak war]]. On January 1993 Croat forces attacked Gornji Vakuf, again to connect Herzegovina with Central Bosnia.<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić" />

In April 1993, the United Nations Security Council issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 816|Resolution 816]], calling on member states to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  On April 12, 1993, NATO commenced [[Operation Deny Flight]] to enforce this no-fly zone.

=====Gornji Vakuf shelling=====

[[Gornji Vakuf]] is a town to the south of the Lašva Valley and of strategic importance at a [[Junction (road)|crossroad]]s '''en route''' to Central Bosnia. It is 48 kilometres from [[Novi Travnik]] and about one hour's drive from [[Vitez]] in an armoured vehicle. For Croats it was a very important connection between the Lašva Valley and [[Herzegovina]], two territories included in the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]]. The Croat forces shelling reduced much of the historical oriental center of the town of Gornji Vakuf to rubble.<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" />

On January 10, 1993, just before the outbreak of hostilities in Gornji Vakuf, the Croat Defence Council (HVO) commander Luka Šekerija, sent a "Military – Top Secret" request to Colonel [[Tihomir Blaškić]] and [[Dario Kordić]], (later convicted by [[ICTY]] of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] i.e. [[ethnic cleansing]]) for rounds of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s available at the [[ammunition]] [[factory]] in [[Vitez]].<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" /> Fighting then broke out in Gornji Vakuf on January 11, 1993, sparked by a bomb Croats placed in a Bosniak-owned hotel used as a military [[headquarter]]s. A general outbreak of fighting followed, and there was heavy shelling of the town that night by Croat [[artillery]].<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" />

During [[cease-fire]] [[negotiation]]s at the Britbat HQ in Gornji Vakuf, [[colonel]] Andrić, representing the HVO, demanded that the Bosnian forces lay down their arms and accept HVO control of the town, threatening that if they did not agree he would flatten Gornji Vakuf to the ground.<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" /><ref name="SENSE Tribunal: Poziv na predaju">{{cite web|url=

Although Croats often cited it as a major reason for the attack on Gornji Vakuf, the commander of the British Britbat company claimed that there were no Muslim ''holy warriors'' in Gornji Vakuf (commonly known as Mujahideen) and that his soldiers did not see any. The shelling campaign and the attacks during the war resulted in hundreds of injured and killed, mostly Bosnian Muslim civilians.<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" />

=====Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing=====

{{Main|Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing}}

The [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing]] campaign against Bosniak civilians planned by the [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]]'s [[political]] and [[military]] [[leadership]] from May 1992 to March 1993 and erupting the following April, was meant to implement objectives set forth by Croat [[nationalist]]s in November 1991.<ref name="ICTY: Blaškić verdict" /> The Lašva Valley's Bosniaks were subjected to persecution on political, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[religious]] grounds,<ref name="ICTY: Initial indictment for the ethnic cleansing of the Lasva Valley area - Part II">{{cite web|url=http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/indictments/Kordic2.html|title=ICTY (1995): Initial indictment for the ethnic cleansing of the Lasva Valley area - Part II}}</ref> deliberately discriminated against in the context of a widespread attack on the region's civilian population<ref name="ICTY: Summary of sentencing judgement for Miroslav Bralo">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/bralo/bra-sum051207-e.htm|title=ICTY: Summary of sentencing judgement for Miroslav Bralo}}</ref> and suffered [[mass murder]], [[rape]], [[imprisonment]] in camps, as well as the destruction of cultural sites and private property. This was often followed by anti-Bosniak [[propaganda]], particularly in the municipalities of [[Vitez]], [[Busovača]], [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Kiseljak]]. [[Ahmići massacre]] in April 1993, was the [[culmination]] of the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing, resulting in mass killing of Bosnian Muslim civilians just in a few hours. The youngest was a three-month-old baby, who was shot to death in his crib, and the oldest was a 81-year-old woman. It is the biggest [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] committed during the conflict between Croats and the Bosnian government (dominated by Bosniaks).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ([[ICTY]]) has ruled that these crimes amounted to [[crimes against humanity]] in numerous verdicts against Croat political and military leaders and soldiers, most notably [[Dario Kordić]].<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" /> Based on the evidence of numerous HVO attacks at that time, the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993 Croat leadership had a common design or plan conceived and executed to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley. Dario Kordić, as the local political leader, was found to be the planner and [[wikt:instigator|instigator]] of this plan.<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" /> According to the Sarajevo-based Research and Documentation Center (IDC), around 2,000 Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley are missing or were killed during this period.<ref name="IDC: Victim statistics in Novi Travnik, Vitez, Kiseljak and Busovača">{{cite web|url=http://www.idc.org.ba/aboutus/Overview_of_jobs_according_to_%20centers.htm|title=IDC: Victim statistics in Novi Travnik, Vitez, Kiseljak and Busovača}}</ref>

=====War in Herzegovina=====

The [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] took control of many municipal governments and services in [[Herzegovina]] as well, removing or marginalising local Bosniak leaders. Herzeg-Bosnia took control of the media and imposed Croatian [[idea]]s and [[propaganda]]. Croatian [[symbol]]s and [[currency]] were introduced, and Croatian curricula and the Croatian language were introduced in schools. Many Bosniaks and Serbs were removed from positions in government and private business; humanitarian aid was managed and distributed to the Bosniaks' and Serbs' disadvantage; and Bosniaks in general were increasingly harassed. Many of them were deported into [[concentration camp]]s: [[Heliodrom camp|Heliodrom]], Dretelj, Gabela, Vojno and Šunje.

Up till 1993 the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) and [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) had been fighting side by side against the superior forces of the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) in some areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Even though armed confrontation and events like the [[Totic kidnapping]]s strained the relationship between the HVO and ARBiH the Croat-Bosniak alliance held in Bihać pocket (northwest Bosnia) and the Bosanska Posavina (north), where both were heavily outmatched by Serb forces.

According to ICTY judgment in ''Naletilić-Martinović case'' Croat forces attacked the villages of Sovici and Doljani, about 50 kilometers north of Mostar in the morning on April 17, 1993. The attack was part of a larger HVO offensive aimed at taking [[Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jablanica]], the main Bosnian Muslim dominated town in the area. The HVO commanders had calculated that they needed two days to take Jablanica. The location of Sovici was of strategic significance for the HVO as it was on the way to Jablanica. For the Bosnian Army it was a gateway to the plateau of Risovac, which could create conditions for further progression towards the Adriatic coast. The larger HVO offensive on Jablanica had already started on April 15, 1993. The artillery destroyed the upper part of Sovici. The Bosnian Army was fighting back, but at about five p.m. the Bosnian Army commander in Sovici, surrendered. Approximately 70 to 75 soldiers surrendered. In total, at least 400 Bosnian Muslim civilians were detained. The HVO advance towards Jablanica was halted after a cease-fire agreement had been negotiated.<ref name="ICTY: Naletilić and Matinović verdict" />

=====Siege of Mostar=====

[[Mostar]] was surrounded by the Croat forces for nine months, and much of its historic city was severely damaged in [[shell (projectile)|shell]]ing including the famous [[Stari Most]] bridge.<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić" />

Mostar was divided into a Western part, which was dominated by the Croat forces and an Eastern part where the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was largely concentrated. However, the Bosnian Army had its headquarters in West Mostar in the basement of a building complex referred to as Vranica. In the early hours of May 9, 1993, the Croatian Defence Council attacked Mostar using artillery, mortars, heavy weapons and small arms. The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied access. Radio Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows. The HVO attack had been well prepared and planned.<ref name="ICTY: Naletilić and Matinović verdict" />

The Croats took over the west side of the city and expelled thousands<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić" /> of Bosniaks from the west side into the east side of the city. The HVO shelling reduced much of the east side of Mostar to rubble. The JNA (Yugoslav Army) demolished Carinski Bridge, Titov Bridge and Lucki Bridge over the river excluding the [[Stari Most]]. HVO forces (and its smaller divisions) engaged in a mass execution, ethnic cleansing and rape on the Bosniak people of the West Mostar and its surroundings and a fierce siege and shelling campaign on the Bosnian Government run East Mostar. HVO campaign resulted in thousands of injured and killed.<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić" />

[[Bosnian Army]] launched an operation known as ''Neretva 93'' against the [[Croatian Defence Council]] and [[Croatian Army]] in September 1993 to end the siege of [[Mostar]], and recapture areas of Herzegovina that were included in the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]]. The operation was stopped by Bosnian authorities after it received information about the [[Operation Neretva '93|massacre]] against Croat civilians and POWs in the villages of Grabovica and Uzdol.

The Croat leadership ([[Jadranko Prlić]], [[Bruno Stojić]], [[Slobodan Praljak]], [[Milivoj Petković]], [[Valentin Ćorić]] and [[Berislav Pušić]]) is presently on trial at the [[ICTY]] on charges including [[crimes against humanity]], grave breaches of the Geneva conventions and violations of the laws or customs of war.<ref name="ICTY: Jadranko Prlić, Bruno Stojić, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petković, Valentin Ćorić & Berislav Pušić" /> [[Dario Kordić]], political leader of Croats in Central Bosnia was convicted of the [[crimes against humanity]] in Central Bosnia i.e. [[ethnic cleansing]] and sentenced to 25 years in prison.<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict" /> Bosnian commander [[Sefer Halilović]] was charged with one count of violation of the laws and customs of war on the basis of superior criminal responsibility of the incidents during [[Operation Neretva '93|''Neretva 93'']] and found not guilty.

In an attempt to protect the civilians, UNPROFOR's role was further extended in May 1993 to protect the "safe havens" that United Nations Security Council had declared around Sarajevo, [[Goražde]], [[Srebrenica]], [[Tuzla]], [[Žepa]] and [[Bihać]] according to its resolution number 824 [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N93/262/07/IMG/N9326207.pdf?OpenElement] .

In 1994, [[NATO]] became actively involved, when its jets [[Banja Luka incident (February 1994)|shot down]] four Serb aircraft over central Bosnia on February 28, 1994 for violating the UN no-fly zone.<ref>Economides, Spyros & Taylor, Paul(2007)."Former Yugoslavia".

The Croat-Bosniak war officially ended on February 23, 1994 when the Commander of HVO, general Ante Roso and commander of Bosnian Army, general Rasim Delić, signed a ceasefire agreement in [[Zagreb]]. In March 1994 a peace agreement&mdash;the [[Washington Agreement]]&mdash; mediated by the USA between the warring Croats (represented by the Republic of Croatia) and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was signed in Washington and Vienna. The Washington Agreement divided the combined territory held by Croat and Bosnian government forces into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. This effectively ended the war between Croats and Bosniaks, and reduced warring parties to two.

The war continued through most of 1995.

In July 1995. Serb troops under general Ratko Mladić, occupied the UN "safe area" of [[Srebrenica]] in eastern Bosnia where around [[Srebrenica massacre|8,000 men were killed]] (most women were expelled to Bosniak-held territory and some of them were raped and killed).<ref name="ICTY: Krstić verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e.pdf|title=ICTY: Krstić verdict|format=PDF}}</ref> The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] ruled this event as genocide in the case ''Prosecutor vs. Krstić''.

In line with the Croat-Bosniak agreement, Croatian forces operated in western Bosnia ([[Operation Summer '95|Operation ''Summer '95'']]) and in early August launched [[Operation Storm|Operation ''Storm'']], taking over the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Serb Krajina]] in Croatia. With this, the Bosniak-Croat alliance gained the initiative in the war, taking much of western Bosnia from the Serbs in several operations, including: ''[[Operation Mistral|Mistral]]'' and ''[[Operation Sana|Sana]]''. These forces now came to threaten the Bosnian Serb capital [[Banja Luka]] with direct ground attack.

Serb forces committed several major massacres during 1995 : the first [[Markale massacre]], [[Tuzla massacre]] (on May 25), the second [[Markale massacre]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre]].

After the second [[Markale massacres|Markale massacre]], [[NATO]] responded by opening [[Operation Deliberate Force|wide air strikes]] against Bosnian Serb infrastructure and units in September.

At that point, the international community pressured Milošević, Tuđman and Izetbegović to the negotiation table and finally the war ended with the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Agreement]] signed on November 21, 1995. The final version of the peace agreement was signed December 14, 1995 in Paris.

==Impact of the war==
===Civil war or a war of aggression===
Because the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a consequence of the instability in the wider region of the former Yugoslavia, and due to the involvement of neighboring countries [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]], there was long-standing debate as to whether the conflict was a [[civil war]] or a war of aggression on Bosnia by neighbouring states. Academics Steven Burg and Paul Shoup argue that:

<blockquote>From the outset, the nature of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was subject to conflicting interpretations. These were rooted not only in objective facts on the ground, but in the political interests of those articulating them.<ref name=Burg>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-4eKmp_qu_QC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA190#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The War in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Ethnic Conflict and International Intervention|first1=Steven L.|last1=Burg|first2=Paul S.|last2=Shoup|year=2000|edition=2nd|location=New York|publisher=M. E. Sharpe|pages=190–191|isbn=1563243091}}</ref></blockquote>

On the one hand, the war could be viewed as "a clear-cut case of civil war – that is, of internal war amongst groups unable to agree on arrangements for sharing power".<ref name=Burg/> [[David Campbell (academic)|David Campbell]] is critical of narratives about "civil war", which he argues often involve what he terms "moral levelling", in which all sides are "said to be equally guilty of atrocities", and "emphasize credible Serb fears as a rationale for their actions".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Metabosnia: Narratives of the Bosnian War|journal=Review of International Studies|first=David|last=Campbell|year=1998|volume=24|issue=2|pages=261–281|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20097522}}</ref> In contrast to the civil war explanation, Bosniaks, many Croats, western politicians and human rights organizations claimed that the war was a war of Serbian and Croatian aggression based on the [[Karađorđevo agreement|Karađorđevo]] and [[Graz agreement]]s, while Serbs often considered it a civil war.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats enjoyed substantial political and military backing from Serbia and Croatia, and the decision to grant Bosnia diplomatic recognition also has implications for the international interpretation of the conflict. As Burg and Shoup state:

<blockquote>From the perspective of international diplomacy and law...the international decision to recognize the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina and grant it membership in the United Nations provided a basis for defining the war as a case of external aggression by both Serbia and Croatia. With respect to Serbia, the further case could be made that the Bosnian Serb army was under the ''de facto'' command of the Yugoslav army and was therefore an instrument of external aggression. With respect to Croatia, regular Croatian army forces violated the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, lending further evidence in support of the view that this was a case of aggression.<ref name=Burg/></blockquote>

[[Sumantra Bose]], meanwhile, argues that it is possible to characterise the Bosnian War as a civil war, without necessarily agreeing with the narrative of Serb and Croat nationalists. He states that while "all episodes of severe violence have been sparked by 'external' events and forces, local society too has been deeply implicated in that violence" and therefore argues that "it makes relatively more sense to ragard the 1992–95 conflict in Bosnia as a 'civil war' – albeit obviously with a vital dimension that is territorially external to Bosnia".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=__l4ZQo_qnQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Bosnia after Dayton: Nationalist Partition and International Intervention|first=Sumantra|last=Bose|year=2002|location=London|publisher=C. Hurst & Co.|page=21|isbn=1850655855}}</ref>

Academic [[Mary Kaldor]] argues that the Bosnian War is an example of what she terms [[new wars]], which are neither civil nor inter-state, but rather combine elements of both.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mary|last=Kaldor|year=2007|title=New and Old Wars: Organised Violence in a Global Era|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=0745638635}}</ref>

===Casualties===
Calculating the number of deaths that resulted from the conflict has been subject to considerable and highly politicised debate.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HmkhqVRxVNIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA159#v=onepage&q&f=false|chapter=Research and repercussions of death tolls: The case of the Bosnian Book of the Dead|first=Lara J.|last=Nettelfield|year=2010|location=Ithaca|publisher=Cornell University Press|editor1-first=Peter|editor1-last=Andreas|editor2-first=Kelly M.|editor2-last=Greenhill|title=Sex, Drugs, and Body Counts: The Politics of Numbers in Global Crime and Conflict|pages=159–187|isbn=0801476186}}</ref> There are large discrepancies between estimates of the total number of casualties, ranging from 25,000 to 329,000. These are partly the result of the use of inconsistent definitions of who can be considered victims of the war. Some research calculated only direct casualties of the military activity while other also calculated indirect casualties, such as those who died from harsh living conditions, hunger, cold, illnesses or other accidents indirectly caused by the war conditions. Original higher numbers were also used as many victims were listed twice or three times both in civilian and military columns as little or no communication and systematic coordination of these lists could take place in wartime conditions; one valid form of historical revision involves identifying where a given victim is separately identified in multiple primary lists, and correcting the resulting overcount; in particular, the RDC and ICTY's demographic unit performed such forensic revision.<ref name="Tabeau"/><ref>Patrick Ball & Ewa Tabeau & Philip Verwimp.

{{quotation|The figure of 200,000 (or more) dead, injured, and missing was frequently cited in media reports on the war in Bosnia as late as 1994. The October 1995 bulletin of the Bosnian Institute for Public Health of the Republic Committee for Health and Social Welfare gave the numbers as 146,340 killed, and 174,914 wounded on the territory under the control of the Bosnian army. Mustafa Imamovic gave a figure of 144,248 perished (including those who died from hunger or exposure), mainly Muslims. The Red Cross and the UNHCR have not, to the best of our knowledge, produced data on the number of persons killed and injured in the course of the war. A November 1995 unclassified CIA memorandumg estimated 156,500 civilian deaths in the country (all but 10,000 of them in Muslim- or Croat-held territories), not including the 8,000 to 10,000 then still missing from Srebrenica and Zepa enclaves. This figure for civilian deaths far exceeded the estimate in the same report of 81,500 troops killed (45,000 Bosnian government; 6,500 Bosnian Croat; and 30,000 Bosnian Serb).}}

As of mid-2003, the Demographic Unit of the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY estimated that 102,622 deaths resulted from the Bosnian conflict, with 55,261 of those people being civilians and 47,360 being military personnel at their time of death.<ref name="Tabeau"/> The authors of this report say that the actual death toll may be slightly higher.<ref name=nrk2004/>

On June 21, 2007, the [[Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo]] published ''the most extensive'' research on Bosnia-Herzegovina's war casualties titled: The Bosnian Book of the Dead - a database that reveals 97,207 names of Bosnia and Herzegovina's citizens killed and missing during the 1992-1995 war. An international team of experts evaluated the findings before they were released. More than 240,000 pieces of data have been collected, processed, checked, compared and evaluated by an international team of experts to produce the final number of over 97,000 victim's names&mdash;victims of all nationalities. The research has shown that most of the 97,207<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.idc.org.ba/prezentacija/Bosna%20i%20Hercegovina.zip RDC - Casualties Research Results - June 2007]</ref> documented casualties (civilians and soldiers) during Bosnian War were Bosniaks (66 per cent), followed by Serbs (25 per cent), Croats (8 per cent) and a small number of others such as [[Albanians]] or [[Romani people]].<ref>[http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&s=f&o=336566&apc_state=henh Bosnia's "Book of the Dead"], ''[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]'', June 23, 2007</ref> Bosniaks also suffered massive civilian casualties (83 per cent) compared to Serbs (10 per cent) and Croats (5 per cent). At least 30 per cent of the Bosniak civilian victims were women and children.<ref>[http://www.idc.org.ba/presentation/research_results.htm estimated from RDC]</ref>

In a statement on 23 September 2008 to the United Nations Dr [[Haris Silajdžić]], as head of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Delegation to the United Nations, 63rd Session of the General Assembly,  said that "According to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] data, 200,000 people were killed, 12,000 of them children, up to 50,000 women were raped, and 2.2 million were forced to flee their homes. This was a veritable [[Bosnian Genocide|genocide]] and sociocide".<ref>[http://www.un.org/ga/63/generaldebate/pdf/bosniaherzegovina_en.pdf Statement by Dr. Haris Silajdžić Chairman of the Presidency Bosnia and Herzegovina, Head of the Delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly on the occasion of the General Debate], [http://www.un.org/ga/63/generaldebate/bosniaandherzegovina.shtml Summary], 23 September 2008.</ref>

There are no precise statistics dealing with the casualties of the [[Croat-Bosniak war|Croat-Bosniak conflict]] along ethnic lines. The RDC's data on human losses in the regions caught in the Croat-Bosniak conflict as part of the wider Bosnian War, however, can serve as a rough [[approximation]]. According to this data, in Central Bosnia most of the 10,448 documented casualties (soldiers and civilians) were Bosniaks (62 per cent), with Croats in second (24 per cent) and Serbs (13 per cent) in third place. The municipalities of [[Gornji Vakuf]] and [[Bugojno]] also geographically located in Central Bosnia (known as Gornje Povrbasje region), with the 1,337 documented casualties are not included in Central Bosnia statistics, but in [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] region statistics. Approximately 70-80 per cent of the casualties from Gornje Povrbasje were Bosniaks. In the region of [[Neretva]] river of 6,717 casualties, 54 per cent were Bosniaks, 24 per cent Serbs and 21 per cent Croats. The casualties in those regions were mostly but not exclusively the consequence of Croat-Bosniak conflict. To a lesser extent the conflict with the Serbs also resulted in a number of casualties included in the statistics. For instance, a number of Serbs were massacred by Croat forces in June 1992 in the village of Čipuljić located in Bugojno municipality.<ref>RDC - Research results (2007) - Human Losses in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1991-1995 [http://www.idc.org.ba/presentation/research_results.htm]</ref>

There were also significant casualties on the part of International Troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some 320 soldiers of [[UNPROFOR]] were killed during this conflict in Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009|reason=that they were significant and a source for the numbers}}

The [[UNCHR]] stated that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina forced more than 2.2 million people to flee their homes, making it the largest displacement of people in Europe since the end of World War II.<ref name=Jolie/>

===War crimes===
====Ethnic cleansing====
[[Ethnic cleansing]] was a common phenomenon in the war. This typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group as well as the destruction or removal of the physical vestiges of the ethnic group, such as places of worship, cemeteries and cultural and historical buildings. Academics Matjaž Klemenčič and Mitja Žagar argue that: "Ideas of nationalistic ethnic politicians that Bosnia and Herzegovina be reorganized into homogenous national territories inevitably required the division of ethnically mixed territories into their Serb, Croat, and Muslim parts".<ref name=Sourcebook/>

==== Genocide ====

{{Main|Bosnian genocide|Bosnian Genocide Case}}
A trial took place before the [[International Court of Justice]], following a [[Bosnian Genocide Case|1993 suit]] by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro alleging [[genocide]]. The [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) ruling of 26 February 2007 indirectly determined the war's nature to be international, though clearing Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by the forces of [[Republika Srpska]]. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those who carried out the genocide, especially General [[Ratko Mladić]], and bring them to justice.
[[File:Exhumations in Srebrenica 1996.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Exhumations in Srebrenica, 1996]]
A telegram sent to the White House on 8 February 1994 and penned by US Ambassador to Croatia [[Peter W. Galbraith]] described stated that genocide was occurring. The telegram cited "constant and indiscriminate shelling and gunfire" of Sarajevo by Karadzic's Yugoslav People Army; the harassment of minority groups in Northern Bosnia "in an attempt to force them to leave"; and the use of detainees "to do dangerous work on the front lines" as evidence that genocide was being committed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/IMG/20091106-friday.pdf|title=Galbraith telegram|author=Peter W.

====Mass rape and psychological oppression ====
{{Main|Rape in the Bosnian War}}
Although during Bosnian War many women were raped on all sides, Bosnian Muslim women were particularly targeted. Estimates of the numbers raped range from 20,000 to 50,000<ref>"Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Conflict: A Framework for Prevention and Response". United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 2008. http://ochaonline.un.org/News/InFocus/SexualandGenderBasedViolence/AFrameworkforPreventionandResponse/tabid/4751/language/en-US/Default.aspx. Retrieved on 2009-06-30.</ref> 

Common profound complications among surviving women and girls include gynaecological, physical and psychological (post traumatic) disorders, as well as unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. The survivors often feel uncomfortable/frustrated/sickened with men, sex and relationships; ultimately affecting the growth/development of a population and/or society as such (thus constituting a slow genocide according to some). In accordance with the Muslim society, most of the girls not married were virgins at the time of rape; further traumatizing the situation. Mass rapes were mostly done in Eastern Bosnia (during [[Foča massacres]]), and in Grbavica during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]]. Women and girls were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions and were mistreated in many ways including being repeatedly raped. Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them. All this was done in full view, in complete knowledge and sometimes with the direct involvement of the [[Serb]] [[local authorities]], particularly the police forces. The head of Foča police forces, Dragan Gagović, was personally identified as one of the men who came to these detention centres to take women out and rape them. There were numerous rape camps in Foča. "Karaman's house" was one of the most notable rape camps. While kept in this house, the girls were constantly raped. Among the women held in "Karaman's house" there were minors as young as 12 and 14 years of age.<ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement" /><ref name="The Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV):Documentation about war crimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.gfbv.ba/index.php?id=126|title=The Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV): Documentation about war crimes - Tilman Zülch}}</ref><ref>[http://www.un.org/icty/transe23-2/030306IA.htm 030306IA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Muslim women were specifically targeted, as rape was a way Serbs could assert superiority and victory over the Bosniaks. For instance, girls and women selected by convicted [[war criminal]] [[Dragoljub Kunarac]] or his men, were systematically taken to the soldiers’ base, a house in Osmana Đikić street no 16. There, girls and women, who Kunarac knew were civilians, were raped by his men or by the convicted himself. Serb soldiers demonstrated a total disregard for Bosniaks in general, and Bosniak women in particular. Serb soldiers removed many Muslim girls from various detention centres and kept some of them for various periods of time, for him or his soldiers to rape.<ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement" />

The other example includes [[Radomir Kovač]], convicted also by [[ICTY]]. While four girls were kept in his apartment, the convicted Radomir Kovač abused them and raped three of them many times, thereby perpetuating the attack upon the Bosnian Muslim civilian population. Kovač would also invite his friends to his apartment, and he sometimes allowed them to rape one of the girls. Kovač also sold three of the girls. Prior to their being sold, Kovač had given two of these girls to other Serb soldiers who abused them for more than three weeks before taking them back to Kovač, who proceeded to sell one and give the other away to acquaintances of his.<ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement" />

===Prosecutions and legal proceedings===
[[Image:Milosevic-karadzic-mladic-wanted-poster.jpg|thumb|right|Wanted poster for [[Slobodan Milošević]], [[Radovan Karadžić]] and [[Ratko Mladić]]]]
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) was established in 1993 as a body of the [[United Nations]] to [[prosecute]] war crimes committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia, and to try their perpetrators. The tribunal is an [[Ad hoc|ad hoc court]] which is located in [[The Hague]], the Netherlands. 

According to legal experts, as of early 2008, 45 Serbs, 12 Croats and 4 Bosniaks were convicted of war crimes by the ICTY in connection with the Balkan wars of the 1990s.<ref name=Convictions/> Both Serbs and Croats were indicted and convicted of systematic war crimes ([[joint criminal enterprise]]), while Bosniaks were indicted and convicted of individual ones. Some high ranking political leaders of Serbs ([[Momčilo Krajišnik]] and [[Biljana Plavšić]]) as well as Croats ([[Dario Kordić]]) were convicted of war crimes, while some others are presently on trials at the ICTY ([[Radovan Karadžić]], [[Vojislav Šešelj]] and [[Jadranko Prlić]]). [[Slobodan Milošević]] was charged with war crimes in connection with the war in Bosnia, including grave breaches of the [[Geneva Convention]]s, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]],<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1672414.stm</ref> but died in 2006 before the trial could finish.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4796470.stm</ref> Other wanted figures suspected of war crimes like [[Ratko Mladić]] and [[Goran Hadžić]] are currently [[Fugitive|at large]]. [[Srebrenica Genocide|Genocide]] is the most serious war crime Serbs were convicted of. Crimes against humanity (i.e. [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing|ethnic cleansing]]), a charge second in gravity only to genocide, is the most serious war crime Croats were convicted of. Breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] is the most serious war crime Bosniaks were convicted of.<ref>[http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/index-e.htm ICTY cases, indictments and proceedings]</ref>

===Reconciliation===

Croatia's president [[Ivo Josipović]] apologized in April 2010 for his country's role in the Bosnian War, the clearest message of reconciliation to date from any leader of the three nationalities involved in Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II. Bosnia's president [[Haris Silajdzic]] in turn praised relations with Croatia, remarks that starkly contrasted with his harsh criticism of Serbia the day before. "I'm deeply sorry that the Republic of Croatia has contributed to the suffering of people and divisions which still burden us today", President Ivo Josipović told Bosnia's parliament.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/04/14/croatia-bosnia-apology.html?ref=rss CBC</ref>

On March 31, 2010, the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]] adopted a declaration "condemning in strongest terms the crime committed in July 1995 against Bosniak population of Srebrenica" and apologizing to the families of the victims, the first of its kind in the region. The initiative to pass a resolution came from President [[Boris Tadic]], who pushed for it even though the issue was politically controversial. In the past, only human rights groups and non-nationalistic parties had supported such a measure.<ref>http://www.ictj.org/en/news/features/3619.html</ref>
