A '''grape''' (pronounced /ˈgrejp/) is a non-[[Climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] [[fruit]] that grows on the [[Perennial plant|perennial]] and [[deciduous]] woody [[vine]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Vitis]]''. Grapes can be eaten raw or they can be used for making [[jam]], [[grape juice|juice]], [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]], [[vinegar]], [[wine]], [[grape seed extract]]s, [[raisins]], and [[grape seed oil]].  Grapes are also used in some kinds of [[confectionery]]. Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape, specifically a [[prolate spheroid]].
== History ==
The [[domestication]] of purple grapes originated in what is now southern [[Turkey]]. [[Yeast]], one of the earliest domesticated [[microorganism]]s, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyphics]] record the cultivation of purple grapes, and history attests to the ancient [[Greeks (wine)|Greeks]], [[Phoenicians (wine)|Phoenicians]] and [[Ancient Rome (wine)|Romans]] growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production. Later, the growing of grapes spread to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and eventually [[North America]].

Native purple grapes belonging to the ''Vitis'' genus proliferated in the wild across North America, and were a part of the diet of many [[North American]]  Native Americans, but were considered by European colonists to be unsuitable for wine. The first [[Old World]] ''Vitis vinifera'' purple grapes were cultivated in [[California]], where [[Spain]] had established a series of monasteries along the coasts to supply their navies with [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] to prevent [[scurvy]] and convert [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]]. There are old Greek troughs and coffins in the Getty Villa, and they show cherubs in tubs of grapes, making wine.

== Description ==
Grapes grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. [[Mutations]] in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of [[anthocyanin]]s which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=White grapes arose through the mutation of two similar and adjacent regulatory genes|author=Walker AR, Lee E, Bogs J, McDavid DA, Thomas MR, Robinson SP|journal=Plant J|year=2007|volume=49|issue=5|pages=772&ndash;85|pmid=17316172 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02997.x|month=Mar|first1=AR|first2=E|first3=J|first4=DA|first5=MR|first6=SP|issn=0960-7412}}</ref> Anthocyanins and other [[pigment]] chemicals of the larger family of [[polyphenols in grape|polyphenol]]s in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Waterhouse AL |title=Wine phenolics |journal=Ann.

== Grapevines ==
{{main|Vitis}}
[[File:Grapes Angoor.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Yaquti Grapes production in 2008, Iran.]]

Most grapes come from [[List of grape varieties|cultivars]] of ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'', the European grapevine native to the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Minor amounts of fruit and wine come from American and Asian species such as:

* ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'', the North American table and grape juice grapevines (including the [[concord (grape)|concord]] cultivar), sometimes used for wine, are native to the [[Eastern United States]] and [[Canada]].
* ''[[Vitis riparia]]'', a wild vine of [[North America]], is sometimes used for winemaking and for jam. It is native to the entire [[Eastern U.S.]] and north to [[Quebec]].
* ''[[Vitis rotundifolia]]'', the [[muscadine]]s, used for jams and wine, are native to the [[Southeastern United States]] from [[Delaware]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
* ''[[Vitis amurensis]]'' is the most important Asian species.

== Distribution and production ==
[[File:2005grape.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Grape production in 2005]]
According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), 75,866 square kilometres of the world are dedicated to grapes. Approximately 71% of world grape production is used for wine, 27% as fresh fruit, and 2% as [[dried fruit]]. A portion of grape production goes to producing grape juice to be reconstituted for fruits canned "with no added sugar" and "100% natural". The area dedicated to vineyards is increasing by about 2% per year. <!-- references needed: Popularity for the purple grape has increased tremendously over the past decade. In March 2006, the Jeremy Patton's purple grapes reached its peak in popularity by being preferred 83% of the time over green grapes in a University of Michigan poll. -->

There are no reliable statistics that break down grape production by variety. It is, however, believed that the most widely planted variety is [[Sultana (grape)|Sultana]], also known as Thompson Seedless, with at least 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. (880,000 acres) dedicated to it. The second most common variety is [[Airén]]. Other popular varieties include [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Merlot]], [[Grenache]], [[Tempranillo]], [[Riesling]] and [[Chardonnay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=29614|title=The most widely planted grape in the world}}</ref>

== Table and wine grapes ==
[[File:Wine_grapes03.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wine grapes on the vine]] Commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make [[wine]] (wine grapes). While almost all of them belong to the same species, ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'', table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through [[selective breeding]]. [[Table grape]] cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced "100% grape juice", made from table grapes is usually around 15% sugar by weight. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wineloverspage.com/dibbern/grapetaste07.phtml|title=Wine Grapes and Grape-y Wines|accessdate=03/07/2010}}</ref>

== Seedless grapes ==
Although grape seeds contain many nutrients, some consumers choose seedless grapes; seedless cultivars now make up the overwhelming majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively propagated]] by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is, however, an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using [[Plant tissue culture|tissue culture]] techniques.

There are several sources of the seedlessness trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: [[Thompson Seedless]], [[Russian Seedless]], and [[Black Monukka]], all being cultivars of ''[[Vitis vinifera]]''. There are currently more than a dozen varieties of seedless grapes. Several, such as Einset Seedless, Reliance and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of north-eastern United States and southern [[Ontario]].<ref>Reisch BI, Peterson DV, Martens M-H. [http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/hort/faculty/reisch/bulletin/table/tabletext3.html "Seedless Grapes"], in "Table Grape Varieties for Cool Climates", Information Bulletin 234, Cornell University, New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, retrieved December 30, 2008</ref>

An offset to the improved eating quality of seedlessness is the loss of potential health benefits provided by the enriched [[phytochemical]] content of grape seeds (see [[#Health claims|Health claims, below]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shi J, Yu J, Pohorly JE, Kakuda Y |title=Polyphenolics in grape seeds-biochemistry and functionality |journal=J Med Food |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=291–9 |year=2003 |pmid=14977436 |doi=10.1089/109662003772519831 |url= |month=Winter |first1=J |first2=J |first3=JE |first4=Y |issn=1096-620X

== Raisins, currants and sultanas ==
[[File:Raisins 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Raisins]]]]In most of Europe, dried grapes are referred to as "raisins" or the local equivalent. In the UK, three different varieties are recognized, forcing the EU to use the term "[[Dried vine fruit]]" in official documents.

A ''[[raisin]]'' is any dried grape. While ''raisin'' is a French [[loanword]], the word in French refers to the fresh fruit; ''grappe'' (from which the English ''grape'' is derived) refers to the bunch (as in ''une grappe de raisins'').

A ''[[Zante currant|currant]]'' is a dried [[Zakynthos|Zante]] [[Black Corinth]] grape, the name being a corruption of the [[French language|French]] ''raisin de Corinthe'' ([[Corinth]] grape). ''Currant'' has also come to refer to the [[blackcurrant]] and [[redcurrant]], two berries unrelated to grapes.

A ''[[sultana (grape)|sultana]]'' was originally a raisin made from a specific type of grape of Turkish origin, but the word is now applied to raisins made from common grapes and chemically treated to resemble the traditional sultana.

=== French Paradox ===
Comparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, surprisingly the incidence of [[heart disease]] remains low in France. This phenomenon has been termed the [[French Paradox]], and is thought to occur from protective benefits of regularly consuming red wine. Apart from potential benefits of alcohol itself, including reduced [[platelet]] aggregation and [[vasodilation]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Providência R |title=Cardiovascular protection from alcoholic drinks: scientific basis of the French Paradox |journal=Rev Port Cardiol |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=1043–58 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17274460 |doi= |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+64-17-5 |first1=R |issn=0870-2551 |format=Free full text}}</ref> [[polyphenols in grape|polyphenol]]s (e.g., [[resveratrol]]) mainly in the grape skin provide other suspected health benefits, such as:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Opie LH, Lecour S |title=The red wine hypothesis: from concepts to protective signalling molecules |journal=Eur.

==Religious significance==
{{See also|Wine#Religious_uses}}
In [[the Bible]], grapes are first mentioned when [[Noah]] grows them on his farm ({{bibleref|Genesis|9:20-21}}). Instructions concerning wine are given in the book of [[Proverbs]] and in the [[book of Isaiah]], such as in {{bibleref|Proverbs|20:1}} and {{bibleref|Isaiah|5:20-25}}. {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:3-5,14:22-27,16:13-15}} tell of the use of [[wine]] during [[Jewish]] feasts. Grapes were also significant to both the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and their [[God]] of agriculture, [[Dionysus]], was linked to grapes and [[wine]], being frequently portrayed with grape leaves on his head.<ref>[http://www.gardenguides.com/90989-grape-leaf-significance.html Garden Guides]</ref> Grapes are especially significant for [[Christians]], who since the [[Early Church]] have used wine in their celebration of the [[Eucharist]].<ref>[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[First Apology]]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxv.html "Chapter LXV. Administration of the sacraments"] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxvii.html "Chapter LXVII. Weekly worship of the Christians"].</ref> Views on the significance of the wine vary between [[denominations]]. In [[Christian art]], grapes often represent the [[blood of Christ]], such as the grape leaves in [[John_the_Baptist_(Caravaggio)#John_the_Baptist.2C_Toledo|Caravaggio’s ''John the Baptist'']].
