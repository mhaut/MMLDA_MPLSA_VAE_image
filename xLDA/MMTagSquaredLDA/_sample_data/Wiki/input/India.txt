Stone Age rock shelters with paintings at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared about 8,500 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]],<ref>{{cite web |title = Introduction to the Ancient Indus Valley |url=http://www.harappa.com/indus/indus1.html

Following [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic invasions from Central Asia]] between the 10th and 12th centuries, much of northern India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later the [[Mughal Empire]].

By early 1700s, the [[Sikh Empire]] and the [[Maratha]]s had emerged as formidable foes of the Mughals.<ref>{{cite book
