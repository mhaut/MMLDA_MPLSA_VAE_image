First thing which comes to my mind regarding police is they are friends of the rich and influential and not the common man.This situation has come to stay because they have a very powerful weapon with them in the form of being the first office installed by the govt.for the protection of the rights of the individual , and help him to earn his lively hood.But unfortunately this weapon provided by the electrorate and govt. is used by him to earn fast money,and there are plenty of money bags to corrupt him.To change there should be amulti pronged action plan.1]police man should be made to feel his profession noble and command respect from the people instead of demanding respect.2]For this feeling to grow in him the police man should be adequately taken care of by providing him a decent pay packet and other basic supports for his family and children to .lead a decent life 3]The police man should take lead for regular interacton and h out the illetrate and poor people of the society , guide them and protect them from exploitation and deprivement. By these deeds he can bridge the communcation gap with the common people 4]It will be worth while for even senior level police men to swap their area for few days to travell and understand the failings by visiting in civil dress where he is not recognised.This was a practice with Rajas in olden days.5]Modify the training pattern to inculcate human values, using specialist psychitratics,along with the tough exterior required in dischargng his duties. 6]Say a word of appreciation about the low level people in force when they do a good job and quote them as example so the spirit to emulate good things are kindled in others also 7]why cannot a police man be thought as you think about your teachers or your family doctor--- with respect and regards.
