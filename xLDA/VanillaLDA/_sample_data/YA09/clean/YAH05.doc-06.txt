It is important the problem and analyse with unbiased understanding before prescribing a solution. Deep rooted problems do not have quick fixes, but here is always a start.

Inequity in societies then and now create most of the internal turmoil. Inequity creates the kind of insecurity in those that are deprived; this creates a common bond. Such insecurity creates anger; anger self destructs; the self destructed individuals become misguided. Of course in their minds their actions are justifiable. I see in Naxalites, who think their solution is better for creating societal equity; religious grps that seem to hove lost all hope to get their due; and at individual levels those that are several distrubed individuals that make the bulk of these groups.

•We have stratified our societies by class, color, race and religion. I'm not sure if we can break this in a life time. You see this is a global problem.
•As long as some minds think the other side is evil, we are not going to resolve this. This is very important. Within the last 6 years we are seeing that often insane has taken the guise of sane.
•Preaching peace alone is not going to get us anywhere either.
•But we can create an atmosphere of trust; we can create a society where people with have-nots have to die in despair (here it is asking for economical security). Meaning the upper class can live in luxury but we need a lower class that is self sufficient. We have not done this in centuries. This is getting out of hand at this point of earth's history.
•We need to educated populations of human diversity. This will be done if we start young. We are quite poised for this with global connection via wireless media. We need to create compassionate atmosphere (when I was in school, I was ridiculed for being dark skinned and not a pretty. This is happening to many kids. I see in India that many developmentally disabled people are ridiculed. What kind of upbringing these people have! This is because lack of compassion)
•Understanding religious diversity to respect other people’s right to their opinions is important. I’m proud of India’s secular heritage. Even though it is not where I expect it should be, we are still making great strides.
•My feeling is we can not erase the worlds that people want to live in, but teaching how we can embrace differences is great.
•As optimist as I’m the only think that we can do as large group is to eradicate poverty. That’s the first step, this will take care of the rest.

Thank you for raising the question, Mr. President.
