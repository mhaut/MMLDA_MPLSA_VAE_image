Gun culture is arriving slowly, it's not about mafia or robbers of Chambal hills. It's about guns in civilized crowd, which we are inheriting from west where showing your Driving License is enough to get a Gun. Our 5000 pages constitution already has many laws in comparision to United States constitution of 500 pages, it's we who are saying "Rules for Fools" and "Laws are made to break" as this happened in this case too, Families with kids less than 18 years child should not be permitted to use guns. If is question for self protection, then what kind of risk demand you to get such dangerous weapons should be replied first and where the applicant will keep the gun in house should be checked first. Now in case if the children got the gun somehow, it's time to stop them before they use it, how? Guns should be manufactured eith some IC chips maybe bluetooth or Infra Red whose other end (receiving end) must be gun owners Identity card or something which he/she will keep in pocket or wallet for sure.
If the gun goes away say 5-10 meters both ends should start ringing or the gun end should be disabled (gun stops working in this case). Guns which do not fulfill this benchmark should not be licensed.
Finally there must be some very-very hard punishment for any disobey of these rules.
