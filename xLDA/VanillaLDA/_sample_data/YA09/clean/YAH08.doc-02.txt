No, not exactly the gun culture has arrived in India but we are becoming careless. we are neglecting our responsibilities, care, love and time towards our children just because of our busy schedule. but kids our Innocent they can't understand this. if we are giving a birth to a new life then this becomes our responsibility to give attention, love and care to them. if this situation has come in India when a student of 8Th class shooting his class mate is the result of his frustration, loneliness, ignorance and our careless nature towards them. They don't know what is love, respect and care these words are new for them they may have knowledge about money but what to do? that is useless.so this a lesson for parents and teachers how to behave with kids.
