PROLOGUE:

A country's economic development is based on how well it mobilizes all available resources (including human resources), toward enhancing the overall living standard of its own people first, and then integrate these within a global context. Essentially this means understanding what our won resources are; defining and delineating these resources; assessing what our NEEDS are; and (in the modern context) techno-economically exploit all these resources (without long term environmental degradation and negative impacts) toward creating all round socio-economic development. Further, it would also be necessary to carry forward all these within a modern democratic frame work, wherein the the mundane needs of the majority commonest people are given precedence over the infinitesimal elitist group.


THE SITUATION:

Although India has shown resilience and great improvement in the democratic processes, the nearly 5000 year history of the "small elite" ruling the "majority down-trodden" is still the order of the day - whether it be the Political Party system of the age old Congress party (which is "dynastic" and sycophancy driven), or the latest bandwagons of Mayawatis/ Lalu Prasads (which are "personality centered"). But these need not cause any alarm, as the democratic process is slowly and steadily progressing - only that the rate of progress is frustratingly slow! Further, although there are various schemes and arrangements for the development of every section of the society that would lead to economic uplift of even the most downtrodden, these frustratingly slow processes of democratization create a near retrograde progress.

Be that as it may, even in spite of these slovenliness in our development processes, the overall progress would show greater impact and results, if we were to be more realistic and “self centered” in our economic schemes and programs. When we say “self centered” it pertains to an “inward look” at OUR OWN RESOURCES, OUR OWN NEEDS, and work up and organize through OUR OWN IDEAS and OUR OWN PEOPLE. But this is NOT the case now, as nearly our entire schemes of Economic development are directed and dictated by WESTERN INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS, which have no economic and social relevance to our scheme of things. Our Agriculture and Food production depend on western scientific developments; our Township planning depends on western systems; our University Education system is dictated by western systems; our industries depend on western scheme of things... the list would go on and on. The so-called IT boom is only a euphemism to the idea of Modern Indians having been enhanced to a status of being CYBER COOLIES rather than being LABOR COOLIES! We also gloat over the idea that the IIT's and IIM's (the temples of Knowledge, as defined by our great visionary Pundit Jawahar Lal Nehru) “push” and “throw-off” more than 50% of those coming out of these institutions to some western nations (the USA, the UK etc) – forgetting that the great amounts of money and efforts spent by Government/ People to train them TO SOLVE INDIA's problems gets the go-by. This trend has been continuing from inception and today there are nearly 4 million Indians in the USA and UK combined, who are estimated to be of NET ECONOMIC worth to the tune of US $50 billions. But of what use do these men/ women are for our developing nation, wherein we must not that we have become poorer by loosing these great souls – whether we may defend them on the basis of the “individual's freedom for economic independence” or whether we despise them for “deserting” their so-called motherland?

Plants, trees, shrubs and other vegetation materials are the systems, which support human existence. But the question is: ARE WE UTILIZING THESE EFFECTIVELY AND SUSTAINABLY? The answer, unfortunately, is NO! WHY? First of all, nearly all our agriculture and farming activities are based on alien technology and agriculture engineering. Second, we do not exploit our INNATE STRENGTHS, and instead, attempt to work against nature. For example, Coffee, Tea, Rubber, Vanilla, etc are not specie of our land, but are alien. Instead, look at these species: COCONUT, ARECA, JACK FRUIT, BANANA, YAMS, PEPPER, TURMERIC, GINGER, CARDAMOM, MANGO, TAMARIND, MELON, GOURDS, etc are our original species. Third, the effects of the alien species and technology (including seed development, pesticides, and all western farm practice systems) not only destroy the ecology (which involve the entire biosystems, including plants and all animals) but adds to the problem by bringing various viruses and other destructive biological effects. Problems like Coconut tree wilt, Jersey
cow’s hoof ailment, Bird flu … the list is long. The original VECHOOR COW (“Naadan Pashu”) of Kerala State never had any ailments. But today no one knows about that specie – and this cow was being “patented” in England, when our local scientists suddenly woke up!!! It has become a “museum subject”. And we have a Fourth reason: we never use more than 10% of the BIOMASS generated in any farm/ plantation activity, wasting almost 90% or more of the total biomass. For example, let us consider Banana cultivation. The per annum per hectare biomass (total materials including the banana trees and banana crops) in a plantation in a state like Kerala, for example, would be about 135 to 150 tons (green weight). However, the real fruit portion would be less than 15 tons – all the balance material being considered as AGROWASTES. The effective Agrowastes, in this case, would be in the range of 125 tons to 140 tons (green weight). If we study the economics of banana cultivation we would observe that the annual gross income per ha would be an optimum value of Rs.150, 000. This is based
on an average value of Rs.10 per Kg of banana fruit. However, if the entire biomass is converted into VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS, we should be able to get about Rs.150, 000 per ha for the biomass alone! The other value added products could fetch anything more than Rs.500, 000, additionally. The same would be the case with any other farm produce system – whether it is coconut, areca nut, mango, jackfruit, etc – though the volumes and values may differ.

If we study the length and breadth of India, we have various biomass systems that have annual renewable resources generation from about 30 tons per ha in the Desert regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat to about 200 tons per ha in the rainy high ranges of Kerala State. Neither have we correctly and fully identified all of these nor have we visualized the huge potentials to sustainably utilize all of these to develop the overall national economy.

When mentioning these, it is not the intention here to camouflage the GROWTH that has taken place, but the intention is to express the reality that THE SO-CALLED GROWTH HAS TAKEN PLACE AT THE COST OF ALIEN INVASION RELEGATING OUR OWN SPECIES AND SYSTEM that have greater economic worth. The retrograde results are now seen in the statistics that nearly TWO LAKH FARMERS HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS, due to economic deprivation – a thing that has been thrust on them by successive governments, in the name of modernization.


OUR STRENGTHS AND POTENTIALS:

It is estimated that India, being in the tropical zone, has the following RENEWABLE RESOURCES:

ANNUAL VEGETATION GROWTH OF 16 BILLION TONS (GREEN WEIGHT)
ANNUAL RAINFALL BASED WATER OF OVER 3, 500 BILLION CUBIC METERS

At this juncture, this writer is reminded of a prophetic and great statement made by an economist, Dr. Richard T. Gill, about fifty years ago:

“Advanced western technology … is by no means ideally suited to the typical under-developed country … Ideally, the under-developed countries would employ neither the western technology of a century ago (which is defective) nor the most modern western technology (which is adopted to a different economics context), but a THIRD technology which consists of an adaptation of modern methods to the special conditions of the under-developed world … “ … but, such a technology does not exist …”

India's biggest resources are: ONE BILLION POPULATION WITH 650 MILLION RURAL PEOPLE and NOT LESS THAN SIXTEEN BILLION TONS (GREEN WEIGHT) RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN THE FORM OF VEGETATION (as mentioned above). It is estimated that a third of these vegetation resources are generated in the virgin forests; another third being generated as grasses, shrubs, weeds and other non agro-resources; the last third being generated in the various agricultural and plantation systems. If we preclude the forest resources, India now has annually renewable non-forest vegetation resources of about TEN BILLION tons, which are mostly wasted. These range from the profuse growth of Tropical green vegetation in Kerala State to the sparsely grown shrubs of Rajasthan desert (see photo
presentation, above). While the former grows at annual rates of over 150 tons per ha, the latter grows at less than 15 tons per ha. If we consider the annual rainfall too, the following are our RENEWABLE NON-FOREST RESOURCES:

 WATER THROUGH RAINFALL ... > 3, 600 TMC
 WATER RETRIEVAL FROM VEGETATION .... > 5 BILLION TONS (5 TMC)
 ORGANIC MATTER IN VEGETATION .... > 2.5 BILLION TONS
 FOOD POTENTIAL ....... 1 BILLION TONS
 RURAL MANPOWER ....... 650 MILLION PEOPLE
 YOUTH IN AGE GROUP 20 TO 30 Yrs .... 300 MILLION PEOPLE
(Note: TMC = THOUSAND MILLION CUBIC METERS)

What do these signify in economic terms? It may be noted that, if these resources were converted, through appropriate (THIRD) Technologies, into goods and services needed by the society, we may visualize the following economic potentials:

(i) FOOD PRODUCTION .... 1 BILLION TONS (> Rs.10, 000 Billion)
(ii) ALTERNATE ENGINEERING MATERIALS … 1 BILLION TONS (> Rs.50, 000 Billion)
(iii) ALTERNATE PETROCHEMICALS ..... 1 BILLION TONS (> Rs.35, 000 Billion)
(iv) ALTERNATE POWER POTENTIAL ..... 400, 000 MWe (> Rs.14, 000 Billion)
(Note: These are additional resources, over and above those now contributing to current GDP; and moreover all these would be occurring in the 600, 000 villages)

The analysis here shows the potentials in the 600, 000 villages in India, which would culminate into a total value addition of over Rs.100, 000 Billions. And, it is amazing to note that these are the additional products/ service potentials, even inasmuch as the other regular economic activities continue simultaneously. Not less than 300, 000, 000 local villagers would be directly employed (full time), apart from another equivalent number being engaged in indirect employment. This could be more succinctly expressed as GROSS RURAL PRODUCTS (GRP) – a connotation that would indicate the development level of the rural areas.

It is, thus, clear that India has enough resources in the rural areas, which could catapult the average PER CAPITA RURAL INCOME to greater than Rs.150, 000. Contrast this with the present wherein an average worker in village never earns more than Rs.5, 000 pa!!!

Thus, if India is to develop to be so-called SUPER POWER, we need to recognize the folly committed so far, and work toward not only correcting these retrograde themes and ideas, but also to redefine our programs and schemes so that the 110 crore people are EMPOWERED WITH GREATER PURCHASING POWER. All other things would follow. However, we need to plan and organize immediately through appropriate education, and all our Universities, IIT's and IIM's should work and think and act towards these, with singular devotion and attention. Then, India could achieve these in the next twenty to thirty years. Let us all pray and hope for that superb future.
