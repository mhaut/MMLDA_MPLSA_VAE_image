You may please like to know that the Gun Culture in India is not new or a new arrival. It is the culture now existing and specially during the past few years, but in different forms such as by Naxalites, Phoolan Devi & Veerappan type of groups, Land Grabers & the recent real estate/property mafias, smugglers, Religion based terrorists etc.etc. Further development is the money power in alliance with political and other vested interest groups. This development took place due to quick money received by undeserving people which lead to various activities of crime, indiscipline, luxry etc.

The present day situation for children is not the aim to study but enroll to a school/college with star type facility. However, this is not the case with all children but there are serious children wanted to devot their time for study and other type of decent extra curricular activities. Children, they get now a days from their parents whatever facilities they ask for wihtout not even asking for such a requirement or verifying the necessity. In some cases the parents support their undesirable activities, and such actions from parents encourage the children to carry on with their activities as they wish. Therefore, you may please understand that the gun culture is not imported to Indian Schools, but is an extension of the existing activity as I mentioned above.

Let us anticipate that all parents teach their children the role of love, compassion, mutual understanding & respect etc. for all fellow beings, as Home Work, before they are sent to the scholls. Let us also hpe, by this way, a future generation may come up with qualitie of morale and healthy living. Till such time, trying to stop the existing cultures can happen to some extent with our unified action and continued persuation against such activities or as a miracle, as I understood.
