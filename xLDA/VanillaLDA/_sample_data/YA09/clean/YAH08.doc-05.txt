Gun culture is already in there in India from a long time since Marxists under communism came into being and they dont allow under priviliged to be participatory in development and they put them on guns illegally produced and smuggled. Thus spread all over India and neighbhering countries thus infiltered in deep rooted our political system and is being protected and abused openly by the same who are to be seen as people's servants [representatives] and saviours of the public. So, the governments & its governing machinery has become impotent. Even leading political parties and politicians use such methods & services fearlessly to stay in power who obstruct the every possible developmental policies in & for the country.

This gun running business has spread so much that gun owners has a very little relevance of safety of the same. Unfortunately, we do see in colleges, universaties but now, it has entered in lower schools. All illegal gun production and smuggling sources must have to be exposed , stopped with full fource throughout the country. Stringent safety factors has to be issued to the licence gun holders. Communism and marxism must be banned to be a true developing India.
