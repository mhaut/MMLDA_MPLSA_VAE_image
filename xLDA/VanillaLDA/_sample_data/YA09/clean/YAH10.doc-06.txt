Swastika is an ancient symbol of Vedic Aryans Of Aryavarta (India) that has brought luck and joy for centuries to all mankind all over the world and continues to do so in the present days. It is a symbol which stands for truth, compassion, tolerance and happiness. It was worshipped as a symbol of good fortune universally long before Hitler’s use of it to symbolize his evil dictatorship. The only fault of Swastika lies in its adoption by Hitler and his Nazi Party and it being used as the prominent emblem of the party and Hitler used to wear swastika on his arm band. Hitler also used to wear a cross, an old and original symbol of Christianity, still being used by orthodox Christians, on his left chest near to his heart. This way the cross can be put into the same category as swastika in relation to Hitler
Because swastika is a symbol of Aryan Culture...which originated as per Hitler's belief in central Europe.So Hitler thought that the Germans are the true Aryans and are made to rule the world.So he adopted the swastika,the original Aryan sybol,as his party symbol.
