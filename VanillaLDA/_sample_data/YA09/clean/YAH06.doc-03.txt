The Police are the guardians of law and order in the country. It is a national force as important as the Army, Navy and the Air Force. In order to increase the efficiency of the police, the government must improve the methods of recruitment of civilians into the police force. There must also be constant reinforcements made to strengthen the force from time to time.
Recruitment to the police must be done carefully through the standard examinations and physical tests. The positions must be awarded based on the capacity of the person and every individual who contributes to the force should be paid regularly.
The payments made to the policemen should be increased without taxing civilians. The amount of money spent on the annual defence budget should be reduced to allocate sufficient funds for the salaries of the policemen.
The police have to do their duties day in and night out. Hence the government must increase their rewards and motivate them to perform better for the development and security of the country.
The values of Brotherhood and a sense of goodwill must be spread among the forces. This will ensure that a sense of law and order exists throughout the nation. If the citizens are happy and safe then the police are naturally kind and protective. Interactions between citizens and the police force should be arranged as a goodwill function that will ensure that the police forces are always friendly and accountable with the common citizens of the Nation
