This is a matter of great concern and i believe that everybody should think about it and put some steep to make a corrupt free.

First before giving any suggestion i would like to impart some light on the ground reality what policemen faces.

First of all though being a government servant they are paid less and hence they use to be in economical crises. There are lot of rules and regulations that they have to follow and have to maintain.
During this procedure a lots of pressure use to be there form the government side to abide by that. Since Government is taking care of there promotions and all related matter it is obvious that they cant go beyond that.
The arms and ammunition that they have been provided is not sufficient, and if in some cases it is possible than they are bounded by the norms of government.

Then i would like to suggest that first of all policemen should be made economically strong so that they wont face any economical problem. After all everybody earn for the betterment of their future and for their livelihood if they couldn't manage to earn their basic livelihood then they will definatly look for other options.

Second promotion policy is so worst that everyone thinks that what is benefit of showing loyality towards the work. So, it must be checked out.

Yes there should be rules and regulations to abide but they should be independent of any kind of unnecessary pressure.

There promotion policy should be monitored by a committee
which would comprise only of those person who is very much aware of the situation. Their promotions should be purely based on their performance.
Their should be a performance apprasel every month so to monitor their activities closely.

There should be a mechanism where everybody should be responsible for their own responsibility, if not found responsible due to any reason, their should be a option of kick them out not only that take as strict action as possible.
