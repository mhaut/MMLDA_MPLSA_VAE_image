Corruption can be rooted out in several ways; one is to pay adequately and ensure a reasonably good life for all. Second inculcate values that decries conspicuous consumption- easier said than done. Keeping up with the Jones is ingrained in the psyche and it is not possible to convert all to be content with what they have. Another is to punish severely those who indulge in corruption. But then 99.5% of the Indian population has to be punished. So you can only hope but it seems the disease is far gone and is a disease embraced by one and all. I have run out of ideas and so the only practical solution is to learn to live with it.
