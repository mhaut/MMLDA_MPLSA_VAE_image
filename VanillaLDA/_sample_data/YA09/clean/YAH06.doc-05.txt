Madam,

Police should be approachable to everyone. People should stop fearing them. To do that please add measurement how many times they smiled at people.

The procedure to approach police for safety should be known to everyone, I have never seen a FIR. How does it look like? What information will be there? Should be visible to every citizen.

Police shouldn’t have direct rights to exercise power instead they should become vehicles for learning safety, preventing problems not reacting to the problems.

Every child, student and adult should be taught about citizenship, his rights and most important his responsibilities. People should be taught to taking ownership, not how to blame others.

All the public services should be taught how to be courteous to general public. At the same time public should be taught not only utilise the services but also support the government employees.

The initiative should start from primary school. Police should start attending school and listen to children, remove the fear of police. Parents should stop threatening children that if you do/don’t do this police will catch you and put you in jail.

Regards
