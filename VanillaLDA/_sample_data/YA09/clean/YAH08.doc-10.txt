I don't think "The gun culture" has arrived in India and never will. One shouldn't and can't really relate to one odd stray incident and generalize. I mean no offence to my brethren from the U.S. of A, but "The gun culture" per se' is a reminiscent from the "Wild West" era. Most Americans are gun totting, "John Wayne" wannabes who haven't really grownup and continue playing "Cowboys and Indians" to the very end. All kudos and accolades to the "Free Market Economy", but then it has its share of evil too. The fact that given the right amount of money, one can virtually buy anything in that country, legally or otherwise, doesn't really help matters much. I don't think Indians will ever really endorse such a culture. So we can be safe in the knowledge that our indulgence in games like "Pithoo" and "Eye-Spy" during our formative years has and will continue to render us immune to the onslaught of such gory influences. I rest my case. Thank You...
