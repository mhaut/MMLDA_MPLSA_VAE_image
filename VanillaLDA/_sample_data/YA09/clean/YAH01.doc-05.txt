Reduce the influence of government, lawyers and the insurance industry in medical policy. 

Incentivize drug companies to develop new and affordable treatments through tax breaks and R&D grants. 

Offer tax incentives to doctors in private practice in poor and working-class areas so that they don't have to resort to joining bureaucratic mega-providers.

Cap malpractice damages so that enormous, punitive payouts will only be awarded to cases where gross negligence and/or malice are present. If mistakes were made by doctors making their best efforts to treat a patient, the patient's Health Insurance coverage should cover a portion of the settlement.

Create a National Health Service with centers that amount to teaching hospitals where those in need can get medical care at low costs. Then create a national scholarship program for students in need. Qualified students who cannot afford medical or nursing programs can earn full or partial scholarships in return for 2 to 4 years service at one of these National Health Centers.

Incentivize medical schools with academic and research grants to loan these hospitals leading faculty members to mentor the National Health doctors. These doctors will not only receive valuable training, but also important exposure to those most in need of their care. By the time their service is up, they will still be young, highly employable and (unlike many of their peers) not forced by student-loan debt to choose jobs based only on pay.

In short, keep costs down for the doctors and patients at the expense of big business and lawyers.

Oh, and one last thing....make lobbying and political contributions by any medical, pharmaceutical or health-related organization (including insurance) ILLEGAL.
