Ok first of all update your antivirus.Doesnt matter what copy of antivirus u have .but some are known to be the best. Norton antivirus works just fine.Install a Firewall.Mcafee Firewall or sygate would be good choice ..this will try and keep most of the hackers away.Notice i said most of them.not all of them..hackers can get into your computer only when u let them in yourself or if they take advantage of the operating system vulnerabilities (most of the times its the windows OS as it is the most widely used operating system) and for spywares u can install Microsoft defender or spysweeper..i would recommend spy sweeper thats what i used to recommend all the customers when i used to work for Dell Tech support but i would recommend using as many antispywares as u can ..3 to 4 would be good choice ..so spysweeper and adaware SE personal edition along with a few more like spinach antispyware 
And here are a few guidelines:
1 Do Not install anything without going through the Terms of Conditions in the software license agreement....i understand it can be painful to read all of it but just go through it and check if it say something like ..this software may install 3rd party software that can display ads or collect your information that is a complete no no..
2 while you are trying to install a software if its asking you to install a tool bar..then its a trap.most of the times..don't install that software.most of the times if its a ad-supported tool bar it wont let u install that software without installing that tool bar.so thats a trap
3 Do Not go to websites that are known to give pop ups ..there are a certain websites that u shouldn't visit like the ones where in u can get a crack for any software or serials number for any famous software..they say its free but ..NOTHING IS FREE IN THE WORLD rem that..they give u free software but once u open the file they start downloading bad content on your computer so they can install some more adwares and that eventually slows your computer as there are too many processes running in the background
4 Most of the websites have a ad like you just won $1,000,000 don't even click on that ad.its fake..once u click on that they install softwares.
5 similar things happen when u go to gambling sites ..but thanks to the govt most websites are being banned in the US which is great relief 
6 For Trojans ..Trojan guard is the best ..there are a few anti-Trojan programs which can work for free for 30 days or less. u can install them.they work fine.
7 Do not open emails from unknown people ..and do not put your email in websites where in they promise to give u something for free in return for your email address
8 If you need anymore information about spy wares and tools to remove spy wares Trojans then u can visit. www.spywareguide.com its a good website.
9 Don't Install P2P software.you are letting people hack your computer easily by installing them
10 Don't Visit Porn Websites. They are the biggest known culprits when it comes to auto-installers and pop ups Trojans viruses.
