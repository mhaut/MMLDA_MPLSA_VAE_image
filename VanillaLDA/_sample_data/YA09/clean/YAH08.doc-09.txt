Karun, this is very good issue you have raised here for the people to express their views. I am 238th person to response and up till you have received 15 stars, all of this shows the gravity of the issue. I must tell all the Indians to think on this issue seriously, it is the SOCIAL CHANGE what we are experiencing, earlier we were listening such news from the west but it has also spread to our country, the land of Rama, Krishana, Mahatama Gandhi etc where non-violence and fraternity was on the top. Where social bonding , respect for others, patience were in the blood of its citizens. But now everything has been changing for destruction. The incidence of Euro shcool has really proved this change. Minors are driving and even racing with cars, killing so many people during race in Mumbai and like that is all the social change in our country, reduction of social, human values. Evidently incidence of Euro school has brought gun culture in India. As for as blaming to parents and school is concerned, I think it is fault of society because children learn everything from society itself. So the reforms in society is required, we have to revert back to our social values and made a beautiful peace loving India without voilence and with patience, fraternity.
