The '''American Civil War''' (1861–1865), also known as the '''War Between the States''' (among [[Naming the American Civil War|other names]]), was a [[civil war]] in the [[United States of America]].  Eleven [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[slave state]]s declared their [[secession]] from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], also known as "the Confederacy." Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], the Confederacy fought against the United States (the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]), which was supported by all twenty [[Free state (United States)|free states]] (where slavery had been abolished) and by five slave states that became known as the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]].

In the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]], the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. In response to the Republican victory in that election, seven states declared their [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the Union before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing administration of President [[James Buchanan]] and Lincoln's incoming administration rejected the legality of secession, considering it rebellion. Several other slave states rejected calls for secession at this point.

Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state to recapture federal property. This led to declarations of secession by four more slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border states early in the war and established a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]]. In September 1862, Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] made ending slavery in the South a war goal,<ref>Frank J. Williams, "Doing Less and Doing More: The President and the Proclamation—Legally, Militarily and Politically," in Harold Holzer, ed. ''The Emancipation Proclamation'' (2006) pp. 74–5.

Confederate commander [[Robert E. Lee]] won battles in the east, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back with heavy [[casualty (person)|casualties]] after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. To the west, the Union gained control of the [[Mississippi River]] after their [[Siege of Vicksburg|capture]] of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], thereby splitting the Confederacy in two. The Union was able to capitalize on its long-term advantages in men and [[materiel]] by 1864 when [[Ulysses S. Grant]] fought [[Overland Campaign|battles of attrition against Lee]], while Union general [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] captured [[Atlanta]]  and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|marched to the sea]]. Confederate resistance ended after Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.

The American Civil War was one of the earliest true [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The practices of [[total war]], developed by Sherman in Georgia, and of [[trench warfare]] around Petersburg foreshadowed [[World War I]] in Europe. It remains the deadliest war in [[History of the United States|American history]], resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties. Ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years of age died, as did 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=YpAuHGkuIe0C&pg=PA&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Killing ground: photographs of the Civil War and the changing American landscape]''".

Victory for the North meant the end of the Confederacy and of [[slavery in the United States]], and strengthened the role of the federal government. The social, political, economic and racial [[Issues of the American Civil War|issues]] of the war decisively shaped the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction era that lasted to 1877]].

{{History of the United States}}
The [[Abolitionist movement]] in the United States had roots in the Declaration of Independence. Slavery was banned in the [[Northwest Territory]] with the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. By 1804 all the Northern states had passed laws to abolish slavery. Congress banned the African slave-trade in 1808, although slavery grew in new states in the deep south. The Union was divided along the [[Mason Dixon Line]] into the North (free of slaves), and the South, where slavery
remained legal.<ref name=hart06>{{cite book

Despite compromises in 1820 and 1850, the slavery issues exploded in the 1850s. Lincoln did not propose federal laws against slavery where it already existed, but he had, in his 1858 [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], expressed a desire to "arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction."<ref>Abraham Lincoln, House Divided Speech, Springfield, Illinois, June 16, 1858.</ref> Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=F20ZsA5ZeeEC&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=Prevent+%22any+of+our+friends+from+demoralizing+themselves%22 |title=Voices from the Gathering Storm: The Coming of the American Civil War |author=Glenn M.

Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern resentment of the influence that [[the Slave Power]] already wielded in government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Disagreements between [[Abolitionist]]s and others over the morality of slavery, the scope of democracy and the economic merits of [[Free Soil Party|free labor]] versus slave [[plantation]]s caused the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and "[[Know Nothing|Know-Nothing]]" parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the [[Free Soil Party]] in 1848, the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] in 1854, the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union]] in 1860). In 1860, the last remaining national political party, the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], split along sectional lines.

Northerners ranging from the abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] to the moderate Republican leader Lincoln<ref>Lincoln's Speech in Chicago, December 10, 1856 in which he said, "We shall again be able not to declare, that 'all States as States, are equal,' nor yet that 'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all men are created equal.'"; Also, Lincoln's Letter to Henry L. Pierce, April 6, 1859.</ref> emphasized Jefferson's declaration that [[all men are created equal]]. Lincoln  mentioned this proposition many times, including his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]].

Almost all the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the [[three-fifths compromise|three-fifths clause]] and a twenty-year extension of the [[African slave trade]] in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The 1793 invention of the [[cotton gin]] by [[Eli Whitney]] increased by fiftyfold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day and greatly increased the demand for slave labor in the South.<ref>The People's Chronology, 1994 by James Trager.</ref> There was controversy over adding the slave state of [[Missouri]] to the Union that led to the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820. A gag rule prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 1835–1844, while [[Manifest Destiny]] became an argument for gaining new territories, where slavery could expand. The acquisition of [[Texas]] as a [[slave state]] in 1845 along with territories won as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848) resulted in the [[Compromise of 1850]].<ref>William E. Gienapp, "The Crisis of American Democracy: The Political System and the Coming of the Civil War." in Boritt ed. ''Why the Civil War Came'' 79–123.</ref> The [[Wilmot Proviso]] was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from Mexico. The extremely popular anti-slavery novel [[Uncle Tom's Cabin|''Uncle Tom’s Cabin'']] (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' pp. 88–91.</ref><ref>Most of her slave owners are "decent, honorable people, themselves victims" of that institution.

The 1854 [[Ostend Manifesto]] was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex [[Cuba]] as a slave state. The [[Second Party System]] broke down after passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with [[popular sovereignty]], allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The [[Bleeding Kansas]] controversy over the status of slavery in the [[Kansas Territory]] included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery [[Border Ruffian]]s. Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]] to attempt to admit Kansas as a slave state. Buchanan supported the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]].<ref>David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 201–204, 299–327.</ref>

The [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858]] included Northern Democratic leader [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' [[Freeport Doctrine]]. This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision that, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid at [[Harpers Ferry Armory]] was an attempt to incite [[slave insurrection]]s in 1859.<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis,'' pp. 356–384.</ref> The North-South split in the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.

Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region.<ref>Lipset looked at the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860-61. In each state he divided the counties into high, medium or low proportion of slaves. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties. the vote was only 37% for secession. (And in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was in the middle at 60%). Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (Doubleday, 1960) p. 349.</ref>  States of the [[Deep South]], which had the greatest concentration of plantations, were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded.<ref>James M. McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'' 1988 p 242, 255, 282–83. Maps on p. 101 (The Southern Economy) and p. 236 (The Progress of Secession) are also relevant.</ref><ref>David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 503–505.</ref>

As of 1860 the percentage of Southern families that owned slaves has been estimated to be 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union.<ref>James G. Randall and David Donald, '' Civil War and Reconstruction'' (1961) p. 68</ref> Half the owners had one to four slaves. A total of 8000 planters owned 50 or more slaves in 1850 and only 1800 planters owned 100 or more; of the latter, 85% lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states.<ref>Randall and Donald, p. 67</ref> According to the 1860 U.S. census, 393,975 individuals, representing 8 percent of all US families, owned 3,950,528 slaves.<ref>[http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html 1860 Census Results], The Civil War Home Page.</ref>

Ninety-five percent of African-Americans lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North, chiefly in larger cities like New York and Philadelphia. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.<ref>James McPherson, ''Drawn with the Sword,'' p. 15.</ref>

The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' escalated the controversy. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney|Roger B. Taney's]] decision said that slaves were "so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect".<ref>David Potter, The Impending Crisis, p. 275.</ref> Taney then overturned the [[Missouri Compromise]], which banned slavery in territory north of the 36°30' parallel. He stated, "[T]he Act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning [enslaved persons] in the territory of the United States north of the line therein is not warranted by the Constitution and is therefore void."<ref>Roger B. Taney: Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).</ref> Democrats praised the ''Dred Scott'' decision, but Republicans branded it a "willful perversion" of the Constitution. They argued that if Scott could not legally file suit, the Supreme Court had no right to consider the Missouri Compromise's constitutionality. Lincoln warned that "the next ''Dred Scott'' decision"<ref>First Lincoln Douglas Debate at Ottawa, Illinois August 21, 1858.</ref> could threaten Northern states with slavery.

Lincoln said, "This question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present."<ref>Abraham Lincoln, Speech at New Haven, Conn., March 6, 1860.</ref> The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories,<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 195.</ref> and the Southern demand for a [[Slave codes|slave code]] for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that, "our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery."<ref>John Townsend, The Doom of Slavery in the Union, its Safety out of it, October 29, 1860.</ref> Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, whites throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.

Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality.<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 243.</ref><ref>David Potter, The Impending Crisis, p. 461.</ref><ref>William C. Davis, Look Away, pp. 130–140.</ref><ref>William W.

Alabama secessionist [[Edmund Strother Dargan|E. S. Dargan]] warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, "we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin."<ref>Speech of E. S. Dargan to the Secession Convention of Alabama, January 11, 1861, in [[s:E.S. Dargan on Secession|Wikisource]].</ref>

Beginning in the 1830s, the US [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South.<ref>Schlesinger ''Age of Jackson'', p. 190.</ref> Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of [[abolitionism]] were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists.<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage'' (2006) p 197, 409; Stanley Harrold, ''The Abolitionists and the South, 1831–1861'' (1995) p. 62; Jane H. and William H. Pease, "Confrontation and Abolition in the 1850s" ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 58(4): 923–937.</ref>
The North felt threatened as well, for as [[Eric Foner]] concludes, "Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests."<ref>Eric Foner. ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970), p. 9.</ref>

During the 1850s, slaves left the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]] through sale, [[manumission]] and escape, and border states also had more free African-Americans and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area.  Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make [[Kansas]] a slave state. By 1860, the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased.<ref>William W. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854–1861, pp. 9–24.</ref>

Even though Lincoln agreed to the [[Corwin Amendment]], which would have protected slavery in existing states, secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless. Besides the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners, secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation, and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall. They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as [[Hinton Rowan Helper]]. Then slavery in the lower South, like a "scorpion encircled by fire, would sting itself to death."<ref name="Freehling">William W. Freehling, The Road to Disunion, Secessionists Triumphant, pp. 269–462, p. 274 (The quote about slave states "encircled by fire" is from the ''New Orleans Delta'', May 13, 1860).</ref>

According to historian Chandra Manning, both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] soldiers who did the actual fighting believed slavery to be the cause of the Civil War.  A majority of Confederate soldiers fought to protect slavery, which they viewed as an integral part of southern economy, [[culture]], and manhood.  Union soldiers believed the primary reason for the war was to bring [[emancipation]] to the slaves.  However, many Union soldiers did not fully endorse the idea of shedding their own blood for [[African American]] slaves, whom they viewed as inferior.  Manning's research involved reading military camp newspapers and personal correspondence between soldiers and families during the Civil War.  Manning claimed that the primary debate in Confederate states over succession was not over state rights, but rather "the power of the federal government to affect the institution of [[slavery]], specifically limiting it in newly added territories."<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Eskridge |first=Larry |title=After 150 years, we still ask: Why ‘this cruel war’?. |url=http://www.cantondailyledger.com/topstories/x1868081570/After-150-years-we-still-ask-Why-this-cruel-war |newspaper=Canton Daily Ledger |location=Canton, Illinois |date=Jan 29, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Sectionalism===
[[Sectionalism]] refers to the different economies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and South.<ref>Charles S. Sydnor, ''The Development of Southern Sectionalism 1819-1848'' (1948)</ref><ref>Robert Royal Russel, ''Economic Aspects of Southern Sectionalism, 1840-1861'' (1973)</ref> It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with subsistence farming for the poor whites.  The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest (from Alabama to Texas).<ref>Adam Rothman, ''Slave Country: American Expansion and the Origins of the Deep South'' (2005).</ref>  However, slavery declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas (it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore, Louisville and St. Louis), so a South based on slavery was rural and non-industrial. On the other hand, as the demand for  cotton grew the price of slaves soared. Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the [[economic determinism]] of historian [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]] in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary.<ref>Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War'' (1981) p 198; Woodworth, ed. ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996), 145 151 505 512 554 557 684; Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1969).</ref>

Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism.<ref>Clement Eaton, ''Freedom of Thought in the Old South'' (1940)</ref><ref>John Hope Franklin, ''The Militant South 1800-1861'' (1956).</ref> Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing, and was prone to new "isms", while the South remained true to historic [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] of the Founding Fathers (many of whom owned slaves, including Washington, Jefferson and Madison). Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution (including the [[Northwest Ordinance]] and the [[Missouri Compromise]]) by preventing expansion of slavery.<ref>Abraham Lincoln, Cooper Union Address, New York, February 27, 1860.</ref> The issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the largest religious denominations (the [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Baptist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.<ref>Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972) pp 648-69.</ref> Industrialization meant that seven European immigrants out of eight settled in the North. The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North as vice versa contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior.<ref name="McPhersonExceptionalism">James McPherson, "Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question," ''Civil War History'' 29 (September 1983).</ref>

Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen like [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Daniel Webster]].  While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called "unionists") and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy.<ref>David M. Potter, "The Historian's Use of Nationalism and Vice Versa," ''American Historical Review,'' Vol. 67, No. 4 (July 1962), pp. 924-950 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1845246 in JSTOR].</ref>  [[C. Vann Woodward]] said of the latter group, "A great slave society...had grown up and miraculously flourished in the heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic. It had renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized its institutional, legal, metaphysical, and religious defenses....When the crisis came it chose to fight. It proved to be the death struggle of a society, which went down in ruins."<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''American Counterpoint: Slavery and Racism in the North-South Dialogue'' (1971), p.281.</ref> Insults to Southern national honor included ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1854)<ref>Bertram Wyatt-Brown, ''The Shaping of Southern Culture: Honor, Grace, and War, 1760s-1880s'' (2000).</ref>  and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown]] in 1859.<ref>Avery Craven, ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848-1861'' (1953).</ref>

===States' rights===
{{Main|States' rights}}
Everyone agreed that states had certain rights—but did those rights carry over when a citizen left that state? The Southern position was that citizens of every state had the right to take their property anywhere in the U.S. and not have it taken away—specifically they could bring their slaves anywhere and they would remain slaves. Northerners rejected this "right" because it would violate the right of a free state to outlaw slavery within its borders.  Republicans committed to ending the expansion of slavery were among those opposed to any such right to bring slaves and slavery into the free states and territories.  The [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] Supreme Court decision of 1857 bolstered the Southern case within territories, and angered the North.<ref name="Forrest McDonald 2002">Forrest McDonald, ''States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776-1876'' (2002)</ref>

Secondly the South argued that each state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time, that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was a "[[compact theory|compact]]" or agreement among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a "perpetual union".<ref name="Forrest McDonald 2002"/> Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

{{quote|While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.<ref>James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pp. 3–9.</ref>}}

===Slave power===
{{Main|Slave Power}}
Antislavery forces in the North identified the "Slave Power" as a direct threat to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. They argued that rich slave owners were using political power to take control of the Presidency, Congress and the Supreme Court, thus threatening the rights of the citizens of the North.<ref>Before 1850, slave owners controlled the presidency for fifty years, the Speaker's chair for forty-one years, and the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee that set tariffs for forty-two years, while 18 of 31 Supreme Court justices owned slaves. Leonard L. Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780-1860'' (2000)  pp. 1-9</ref>

===Free soil===
"Free soil" was a Northern demand that the new lands opening up in the west be available to independent [[yeoman]] farmers and not be bought out by rich slave owners who would buy up the best land and work it with slaves, forcing the white farmers onto marginal lands. This was the basis of the [[Free Soil Party]] of 1848, and a main theme of the Republican Party.<ref>Eric Foner, ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War'' (1970)</ref>

===Tariffs===
{{Main|Tariffs in United States history}}

The [[Tariff of 1828]], was a high protective [[tariff]] or tax on imports passed by Congress in 1828. It was labeled the "Tariff of Abominations"<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&intID=45], [[Office of the Clerk]] [http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&intID=45]</ref> by its southern detractors because of its effect on the Southern economy. The 1828 tariff was repealed after strong protests and threats of [[Nullification Crisis|nullification]] by South Carolina.

The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners,  wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates, so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816.  The South had no complaints but the low rates angered Northern industrialists and factory workers, especially in Pennsylvania, who demanded protection for their growing iron industry.
The Whigs and Republicans favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were finally enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.<ref>Frank Taussig, ''The Tariff History of the United States'' (1931), pp 115-61</ref><ref>Richard Hofstadter, "The Tariff Issue on the Eve of the Civil War," ''The American Historical Review'' Vol. 44, No. 1 (Oct., 1938), pp.&nbsp;50-55 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1840850 full text in JSTOR]</ref>

Historians in recent decades have minimized the tariff issue, noting that few people in 1860-61 said it was of central importance to them.  Some secessionist documents do mention the tariff issue, though not nearly as often as the preservation of slavery.  However, a few [[libertarian]] economists place more importance on the tariff issue.<ref>Mark Thornton and Robert B. Ekelund, Jr., ''Tariffs, Blockades, and Inflation: The Economics of the Civil War'' (2004)</ref>

===Election of Lincoln===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
The election of Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis,'' p. 485.</ref> Efforts at compromise, including the "[[Corwin Amendment]]" and the "[[Crittenden Compromise]]", failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined together to form the Confederacy.

===Battle of Fort Sumter===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
The Lincoln Administration, just as the outgoing Buchanan administration before it, refused to turn over Ft. Sumter—located in the middle of the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet decided that it was impossible to be an independent nation with a foreign military fort in its leading harbor, so he ordered Confederate forces to attack. After a heavy bombardment on April 12–13, 1861, (with no intentional casualties), the fort surrendered. Lincoln then called for 75,000 troops from the states to recapture the fort and other federal property.  Rather than furnish troops and access for an attack on their fellow southern states, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas elected to join them in secession.  North and South the response to Ft. Sumter was an overwhelming demand for war to uphold national honor. Only Kentucky tried to remain neutral. Hundreds of thousands of young men across the land rushed to enlist.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War'' (1999)</ref>

===Secession of South Carolina===
South Carolina [[History of South Carolina#Antebellum South Carolina|did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state]]. South Carolina adopted the "[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]" on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.

===Secession winter===
Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861.<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, p. 254.</ref> They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [[Dred Scott decision]] was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union "was intended to be perpetual", but that "the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union" was not among the "enumerated powers granted to Congress".<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29501 President James Buchanan, Message of December 8, 1860 online].</ref> One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [[David E. Twiggs]], who then joined the Confederacy.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the [[Morrill Tariff]], land grant colleges (the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morill Act]]), a [[Homestead Act]], a transcontinental railroad (the [[Pacific Railway Acts]]), the [[National Banking Act]] and the authorization of [[United States Note]]s by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The [[Revenue Act of 1861]] introduced the [[income tax]] to help finance the war.

===The Confederacy===
{{Main|Confederate States of America}}
Seven [[Deep South]] cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with [[South Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America (February 4, 1861), with [[Jefferson Davis]] as president, and a [[Confederate States Constitution|governmental structure]] closely modeled on the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].

Following the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, four more Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy: [[Virginia]], [[Arkansas]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of [[West Virginia]] on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861, [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] were effectively under Union control, with Confederate state governments in exile.

===The Union states===
{{Main|Union (American Civil War)}}
Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]]. During the war, [[Nevada]] and [[West Virginia]] joined as new states of the Union. [[Tennessee]] and [[Louisiana]] were returned to Union military control early in the war.

The territories of [[Colorado Territory|Colorado]], [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Territory|Nevada]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Washington Territory|Washington]] fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]) a small, bloody civil war.<ref>Gibson, Arrell. ''Oklahoma, a History of Five Centuries'' ([[University of Oklahoma]] Press, 1981) pg.&nbsp;117–120</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2008-01-28 | url=http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unindtr.htm | title=United States Volunteers — Indian Troops| work=civilwararchive.com | accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CI013.html| title=Civil War Refugees| work=[[Oklahoma Historical Society]]|publisher=[[Oklahoma State University]] | accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref>

===Border states===
{{Main|Border states (American Civil War)}}
The border states in the Union were [[West Virginia]] (which separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ([[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]]).

[[Maryland]] had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with [[martial law]] and sent in militia units from the North.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 284–287.</ref> Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by arresting all the prominent secessionists and holding them without trial (they were later released).

In Missouri, an [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)|elected convention]] on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. (''See also: [[Missouri secession]]''). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.<ref>Nevins, ''The War for the Union'' (1959) 1:119-29</ref>

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky.<ref>Nevins, ''The War for the Union'' (1959) 1:129-36</ref>

After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34% approved the statehood bill (96% approving).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/History/statehood/statehood10.html |title=A State of Convenience, The Creation of West Virginia |publisher=West Virginia Archives & History}}</ref> The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties<ref>Curry, Richard Orr, ''A House Divided, A Study of the Statehood Politics & the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, map on page 49</ref>  in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war<ref>Weigley, Russell F., "A Great Civil War, A Military and Political History 1861-1865'', Indiana Univ.

===The beginning of the war, 1861===
{{Details|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
Lincoln's victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]]. A pre-war February [[Peace Conference of 1861]] met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response apart from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter using the ship ''[[Star of the West]]'', which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 234–266.</ref> However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.

On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|''more perfect union'']] than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession "legally void".<ref>Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, Monday, March 4, 1861.</ref> He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union.<ref>Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861.</ref>

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.<ref name="PotterNegotiations">David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 572–573.</ref> However, Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.<ref name="PotterNegotiations"/>

[[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, and [[Fort Pickens]], [[Fort Jefferson]], and [[Fort Zachary Taylor|Fort Taylor]], all in Florida, were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold them all. Under orders from Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], troops controlled by the Confederate government under [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12, forcing its capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolntroops.htm |title=Lincoln's Call for Troops}}
</ref>
citing presidential powers given by the [[Militia Acts of 1792]]. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90&nbsp;days.<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, p. 274.</ref> For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day.<ref>Massachusetts in the Civil War, William Schouler, 1868 book republished by Digital Scanning Inc, 2003 – See the account at [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1582180016&id=ub8cqVKoXwgC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA34&vq=baltimore&dq=schouler+massachusetts+civil&sig=g5za9rXjH9ttx1vzmWNN39F3YFQ].</ref> Confederate sympathizers seized [[Liberty Arsenal]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]] on April 20, eight days after Fort Sumter.

Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 276–307.</ref> The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of [[Atlanta]] and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.

===Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861===
{{Main|Naval battles of the American Civil War|Union blockade|Confederate States Navy}}
[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|300px|1861 cartoon of Scott's "[[Anaconda Plan]]"]]

[[Winfield Scott]], the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible.<ref>Allan Peskin, ''Winfield Scott and the profession of arms'' (2003) pp 249-52</ref> His idea was that a [[Union blockade]] of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the [[Mississippi River]] would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.<ref>.Timothy D. Johnson, ''Winfield Scott'' (1998) p. 228</ref>

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended.  The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake it was too late. "King Cotton" was dead, as the South could export less than 10% of its cotton.<ref>Dean B. Mahin, ''One war at a time: the international dimensions of the American Civil War'' (2000) ch 6</ref>  British investors built small, fast [[blockade runner]]s that traded arms and luxuries brought in from [[Bermuda]], [[Cuba]] and the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 378–380.</ref>  When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released.  The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war.  Shortages of food and supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing [[Southern Bread Riots|bread riots]] across the Confederacy.<ref>Heidler, 1651–53.</ref>

On March 8, 1862, the [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate Navy]] waged a fight against the [[United States Navy|Union Navy]] when the [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] attacked the blockade. Against wooden ships, she seemed unstoppable. The next day, however, she had to fight the new Union warship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Battle of the Ironclads]].<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 373–377.</ref> Their battle ended in a draw. The Confederacy lost the ''Virginia'' when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of ''Monitor''. Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. The Union victory at the [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]] in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.

===Eastern theater 1861–1863===
{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}
[[File:CivilWarFifeandDrum.jpg|thumb|left|A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps]]

Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Virginia]], in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'',<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 339–345.</ref> McDowell's troops were forced back to [[Washington, D.C.]], by the Confederates under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the [[nickname]] of "Stonewall" because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops.<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, p. 342.</ref>

Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.

Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Wager Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],<ref>Shelby Foote, The Civil War: Fort Sumter to Perryville, pp. 464–519.</ref><ref>Bruce Catton, Terrible Swift Sword, pp. 263–296.</ref><ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 424–427.</ref>

The [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 528–533.</ref> McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North. General Lee led 45,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]]<ref name = "ryywpm"/> near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], [[Maryland]], on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 543–545.</ref>  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 557–558.</ref>

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 571–574.</ref> on December 13, 1862, when over twelve thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863]] Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 639–645.</ref> in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 653–663.</ref> (July 1 to July 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory.   Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).<ref>James McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' p. 664.</ref> However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership.  At the same time the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

===Western theater 1861–1863===
{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]].<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 404–405.</ref> [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], [[Kentucky]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.
[[File:Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Chickamauga was one of the deadliest battles in the Western Theater.]]
The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], [[Missouri]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  In April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] captured [[New Orleans]]<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 418–420.</ref> without a major fight, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], prevented Union control of the entire river.

General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the [[Battle of Perryville]],<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 419–420.</ref> although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]]<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 480–483.</ref> in [[Tennessee]].

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]]. Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers); [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]];<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 405–413.</ref> and the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vicksburg]],<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 637–638.</ref> which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning points]] of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Third Battle of Chattanooga]],<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 677–680.</ref> driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi theater 1861–1865===
{{Details|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}
[[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla]] activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war.<ref name="MissFacts">{{cite web|title=Civil War in Missouri Facts|url=http://home.usmo.com/~momollus/MOFACTS.HTM|year=1998|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]], and [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|New Mexico Territory]] for the Union. Confederate incursions into [[New Mexico territory]] were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure [[Indian Territory]] succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's [[Red River Campaign]] was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

Sherman]], General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], Lincoln, and Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] discuss military plans for the final months of the Civil War.]]
At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war.<ref>Mark E. Neely Jr.; "Was the Civil War a Total War?" ''Civil War History'', Vol. 50, 2004 pp 434+</ref> This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms, and railroads. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals George Meade and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) were to [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|attack the Shenandoah Valley]], General Sherman was to capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] were to operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]], and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks|Nathaniel P. Banks]] was to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]].

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase ("Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]") of the Eastern campaign. Grant's [[attrition warfare|battles of attrition]] at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 724–735.</ref> resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks),<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 741–742.</ref> kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]],<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 778–779.</ref> a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 773–776.</ref> Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]].<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 812–815.</ref> Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.
[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|Confederate dead of General [[Richard S. Ewell|Ewell]]'s Corps who attacked the Union lines at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 19, 1864.]]
Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south,<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 825–830.</ref> increasing the pressure on Lee's army.

Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 846–847.</ref> to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]], it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.

===Confederacy surrenders===
{{Main|Conclusion of the American Civil War}}
[[File:Civil war 1861-1865.jpg|right|thumb|380px| Map of Confederate territory losses]]

Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the [[McLean House (Appomattox, Virginia)|McLean House]] in the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|village of Appomattox Court House]].<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 848–850.</ref> In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully folding the Confederacy back into the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his officer's saber and his horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]]. On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Southern sympathizer.  Lincoln died early the next morning, and [[Andrew Johnson]] became President.

Unaware of the surrender of Lee, on April 16 the last major battles of the war were fought at the [[Battle of Columbus, Georgia]] and the [[Battle of West Point]]. Both towns surrendered to [[Wilson's Raid]]ers.

==Slavery during the war==
{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}
At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves "...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union."<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'' p. 495.</ref> The same Congressman—and his fellow Radical Republicans—put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' pp. 355, 494–6, quote from [[George Washington Julian]] on 495.</ref> [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] and [[War Democrats]] opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of [[total war]] needed to save the Union.

In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that "to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."<ref>Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861</ref> At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C. Frémont]] (in Missouri) and [[David Hunter]] (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.

Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected.<ref>Lincoln, the War President: The Gettysburg Lectures (Gettysburg Civil War Institute Books) by Gabor S. Boritt (Editor), pp. 52–54. The article is by James McPherson.</ref> Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his cabinet on July 21, 1862. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like "our last shriek on the retreat".<ref>Stephen B. Oates, Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths, p. 106.</ref> In September 1862 the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.<ref>Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.</ref> Lincoln had already published a letter<ref>Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862</ref> encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was "somehow the cause of the war".<ref name="SecondInaugural">Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865 – Here Lincoln states, "One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it."</ref> Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."<ref>Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864</ref>

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.<ref>James McPherson, The War that Never Goes Away</ref> Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]],<ref name="WhoFreed">James McPherson, Drawn With the Sword, from the article Who Freed the Slaves?</ref> which made emancipation universal and permanent.

Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].
[[Image:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright|Union Army soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]] in May, 1865. After the war, Henry Wirz, the prison's commandant, was tried for war crimes by a military commission and executed.]]
Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''Never Call Retreat'', p. 335.</ref> This led to a breakdown of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|prisoner and mail exchange program]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dce.k12.wi.us/historyday/Topics/CivilWar.htm |title=Civil War Topics |publisher=Dce.k12.wi.us |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> and the growth of prison camps such as [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison]] in Georgia,<ref>"[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/12/book-review-blacks-labored-in-andersonville/ Blacks labored in Andersonville]". Washington Times. November 12, 2009.</ref> where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease.<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 791–798.</ref>

In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders&nbsp;— until 1865&nbsp;— opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, "If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong." Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented.<ref>James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 831–837.</ref>

Historian [[John D. Winters]], in ''The Civil War in Louisiana'' (1963), referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through [[Louisiana]]: "As the troops moved up to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army. They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there."<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, ISBN 0-8071-0834-0, p. 237</ref>

The Emancipation Proclamation<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 557–558, 563.</ref> greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.<ref name="SlavDela">{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=SLAVERY in DELAWARE|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/delaware.htm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> The great majority of the 4&nbsp;million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved South. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]],<ref>McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 840–842.</ref> ratified December 6, 1865, finally made slavery illegal everywhere in the United States, thus freeing the remaining slaves—65,000 in Kentucky (as of 1865),<ref>Lowell Hayes Harrison and James C. Klotter, ''A New History of Kentucky'' (1997) p 235, the number in late 1865.</ref> 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860.<ref>U. S. Census of 1860.</ref>

Historian Stephen Oates said that many myths surround Lincoln: "man of the people", "true Christian", "arch villain" and racist. The belief that Lincoln was racist was caused by an incomplete picture of Lincoln, such as focusing on only selective quoting of statements Lincoln made to gain the support of the border states and Northern Democrats, and ignoring the many things he said against slavery, and the military and political context within which such statements were made. Oates said that Lincoln's letter to [[Horace Greeley]] has been "persistently misunderstood and misrepresented" for such reasons.<ref>Stephen B. Oates, Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths, 1984, Harper & Row.</ref>

==Blocking international intervention==
{{Main|Britain in the American Civil War|France in the American Civil War}}
The Confederacy's best hope was military intervention into the war by Britain and France against the Union.<ref>James McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' pp. 546–557.</ref> The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America (none ever did). In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton. [[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It was said that "King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton", as US grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' p. 386.</ref>

When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, iron workers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref>Allen Nevins, ''War for the Union 1862–1863'', pp. 263–264.</ref>

[[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as [[ambassador|minister]] to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain (who had herself abolished slavery in her own colonies in 1834). War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|British mail steamer]] to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two.

In 1862, the British considered mediation—though even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin|Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref>Stephen B. Oates, ''The Approaching Fury: Voices of the Storm 1820–1861,'' p. 125.</ref> The Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris.

Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars emphasize that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Civil War  historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly: "I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."<ref>Ward 1990 p 272</ref> The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves, Britain, and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 771–772.</ref> Lincoln had found military leaders like Grant and Sherman who would press the Union's numerical advantage in battle over the Confederate Armies. Generals who did not shy from bloodshed won the war, and from the end of 1864 onward there was no hope for the South.

On the other hand, [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] has argued that the North’s advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely, but not inevitable. Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref>James McPherson, Why did the Confederacy Lose?</ref>

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name="WarLeader">{{cite web|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Don|title=Lincoln's Wartime Leadership: The First Hundred Days|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/9/fehrenbacher.html|year=2004|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly the United Kingdom and France.  Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities.  Lincoln's naval blockade was 95% effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and the United Kingdom's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either the United Kingdom or France would enter the war.

The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22&nbsp;million and the South 9&nbsp;million in 1861. The Southern population included more than 3.5&nbsp;million slaves and about 5.5&nbsp;million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one.<ref name="Tread">{{cite book|last=Crocker III |first=H.

The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, riverboats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline.<ref>McPherson 313–16, 392–3</ref> Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies.

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war (and continued to 1877) in an effort to solve the issues caused by reunion, specifically the legal status of the 11 breakaway states, the Confederate leadership, and the freedmen. Northern leaders during the war agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln and the Radical Republicans disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control that should be imposed on the South, and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.  These disputes became central to the political debates after the Confederacy collapsed.

===Results===
[[File:Grand Army of the Republic by Swatjester.jpg|thumb|Monument in honor of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], organized after the war.]]

Slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied prior to the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 18, 1865) by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease.<ref name="StatsWarCost">{{cite web|last=Nofi|first=Al|title=Statistics on the War's Costs|publisher=Louisiana State University|date=2001-06-13|url=http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711050249/http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archivedate=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> The war accounted for roughly as many American deaths as all American deaths in other U.S. wars combined.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, "Introduction" in  James McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' p. xix.</ref>

The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for its outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]] are subjects of lingering contention today. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all [[White people|white]] males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=gySktxKYPGoC&pg=PA7&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Toward a social history of the American Civil War: exploratory essays]''".

National Geographic News. July 1, 2003.</ref> One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] tactics, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Minié ball]]s and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of [[trench warfare]], a style of fighting that defined the better part of [[World War I]].

Civil War soldiers were able to buy [[personal armor]] independently through private sellers.  The Union and Confederate armies had considered yet rejected issuing protective body armor as standard clothing. The standard issue Civil War cloth vests given to the soldiers gave them limited protection.  Civil war soldiers, however, often disregarded using their heavy vests due to long marches.

==Memory and historiography==
===1963 Gettysburg parade===
On November 19, 1963 a parade was held in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]] in honor of President Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] given six months after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  Lincoln had given the address 100 years before during the Civil War in Gettysburg in 1863.  The sedan [[motorcade]] parade followed the same route that President Lincoln and Gov. [[Andrew Gregg Curtin|Andrew G. Curtin]] took 100 years before.  Former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was there accompanied by Gov. [[William W. Scranton]].  The attendance at the 1963 commemoration was lower than the 20,000 to 30,000 persons who attended the original address by President Lincoln in 1863.  Thousands of photographers attended the 1963 event while U.S. Airforce jets passed overhead. Also attending the event were the 28th Division of the Pennsylvania National Guard headed by Maj. Gen. Henry F. Fluck , the U.S. Marine Band, and the 3rd Infantry of the U.S. Army.  The parade ended at the rear entrance into the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]].<ref>The Gettysburg Times (Wednesday, November 20, 1963), ''Procession To Cemetery Was Similar To '63 Event'', pp. 1, 10</ref>

===Historical views and perspectives===
The year 2011 will include the American Civil War's 150th anniversary.  Many in the south are attempting to incorporate both [[African American]] and white perspectives.  One African American, Benard Simelton, president of the [[Alabama]] [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], said celebrating the Civil War is like celebrating the "[[Holocaust]]".  In reference to slavery Simelton said that black "rights were taken away" and that blacks "were treated as less than human beings."  National Park historian Bob Sutton said that slavery was the "principal cause" of the war. Sutton also claimed that the issue of state rights was incorporated by the [[Confederacy]] as a justification for the war in order to get recognition from [[United Kingdom|Britain]].  Sutton went on to mention that during the 100th anniversary of the Civil War white southerners focused on the genius of southern generals, rather than slavery. In [[Virginia]] during the fall of 2010, a conference took place that addressed the slavery issue.  During November 2010, black Civil War reenactors from around the country have participated in a parade at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Civil War's 150th anniversary stirs debate on race |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g02LT3cnj71haIQ8NXfRM-jR69yQ?docId=17de1f3fa7fe4a6999feb41ff12de8a1 |author=Associated Press |location=Charles, South Carolina
