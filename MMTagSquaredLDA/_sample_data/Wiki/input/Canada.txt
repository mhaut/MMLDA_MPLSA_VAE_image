'''Canada''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|n|ə|d|ə}}) is a [[North America]]n country consisting of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]]. Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends  from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. It is the world's second largest [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|country by total area]]. Canada's [[Canada – United States border|common border]] with the [[United States]] to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.

The land that is now Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]].

Canada is a [[federation]] that is governed as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]]. It is a [[Official bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nation with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] as official languages at the federal level. One of the world's [[developed country|highly developed countries]], Canada has a diversified economy that is reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade—particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada – United States relations|long and complex relationship]]. It is a member of the [[G8]], [[G-20 major economies|G-20]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[World Trade Organisation|WTO]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], [[Organisation of American States|OAS]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and [[United Nations|UN]].

=== Etymology ===
{{Main|Name of Canada}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing or reverting this to specify which (of several) languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at the main article Name of Canada-->
The name ''Canada'' comes from a [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word, ''kanata'', meaning "village" or "settlement".<ref name=origin>{{cite web|title=Origin of the Name, Canada|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o5-eng.cfm|publisher=Canadian Heritage (Government of Canada)|year=2008|accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] towards the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref name="maura"/> Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village, but also the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as ''Canada''.<ref name="maura">{{cite journal|last=Maura|first=Juan Francisco|year=2009|title=Nuevas aportaciones al estudio de la toponimia ibérica en la América Septentrional en el siglo XVI|journal=Bulletin of Spanish Studies|publisher=Routledge|volume=86|issue=5|pages=577–603|doi=10.1080/14753820902969345|ref=harv}}</ref>

In the 17th and early 18th century, [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] referred to the part of [[New France]] that lay along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]].  The area was later split into two British colonies, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]].  They were re-unified as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.<ref>{{cite book

=== Provinces and territories ===
{{Main|Provinces and territories of Canada}}
{{See also|Canadian federalism}}

Canada is a federation composed of ten [[province]]s and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be [[List of regions of Canada|grouped into regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (the latter made up of the three territories: Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut). [[Eastern Canada]] refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together. Provinces have [[Canadian federalism|more autonomy]] than territories. The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-516-x/sectionh/4057752-eng.htm|title=Government Finance|last=Bird|first=Richard M|date=2008-10-22|work=Historical Statistics of Canada|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>

Canada's two official languages are English and French.

Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French, and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Languages in Canada: Federal Policy|publisher=Library of Parliament|date=2009-06-30|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0844-e.htm|accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>

Historically Canada has been influenced by [[British culture|British]], [[French culture|French]], and aboriginal cultures and traditions.  Many North American Indigenous words, inventions and games have become an everyday part of [[Spoken languages of Canada|Canadian language]] and use. Through their culture, [[Spoken languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|languages]], [[Native American art|art]] and [[First Nations music|music]], aboriginals continue to exert influence on the [[Canadian identity]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=GkAuYRVjlE8C&lpg=PP1&dq=Aboriginal%20peoples%20%20Canada&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=true|pages=3–6|title=Aboriginal peoples of Canada: a short introduction|first=Paul R|last= Magocsi|publisher= University of Toronto Press|year=2002|isbn=0802036309|accessdate=2011-14-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/socstud/foundation_gr2/blms/2-2-1c.pdf |format=PDF |title=Diverse Peoples&nbsp;– Aboriginal Contributions and Inventions|work=The Government of Manitoba| accessdate =2009-10-17 }}</ref> 

Many Canadians value multiculturalism and see Canada as being inherently multicultural.<ref name="bickerton" /> However, the country's culture has been heavily influenced by [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] because of its proximity and the high rate of migration between the two countries. The great majority of English-speaking immigrants to Canada between 1755 and 1815 were Americans from the Thirteen Colonies; during and immediately after the American Revolutionary War, 46,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Americans loyal to the British crown]] came to Canada.<ref>{{cite book|title=Britain and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|editor=Will Kaufman, Heidi Slettedahl MacPherson|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|page=888|chapter=Settlement Policies|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=HbBbn3x7PZsC&lpg=PP2&dq=Britain%20and%20the%20Americas%3A%20culture%2C%20politics%2C%20and%20history&pg=PA888#v=onepage&q&f=true|isbn=1851094318|accessdate=2011-01-14}}</ref> Between 1785 and 1812, more Americans emigrated to Canada in response to promises of land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dollinger|first=Stefan|title=New-dialect formation in Canada: evidence from the English modal auxiliaries|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2008|page=66|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=eeCw_-fFAMIC&lpg=PP1&dq=New-dialect%20formation%20in%20Canada%3A%20evidence%20from%20the%20English%20modal%20auxiliaries&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=true|isbn=9027231087|accessdate=2011-01-14}}</ref>

American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |first=John D |last=Blackwell |url=http://www.iccs-ciec.ca/blackwell.html#culture |title=Culture High and Low |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-03-15 |publisher=International Council for Canadian Studies World Wide Web Service}}</ref> Many cultural products are marketed toward a unified "North American" or global market.
