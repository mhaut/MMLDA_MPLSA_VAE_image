'''Horse meat''' is the culinary name for meat cut from a [[horse]]. It is a major meat in only a few countries, notably in [[Central Asia]], but it forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many others, from Europe to South America to Asia, the top eight countries consuming about 4.7 million horses a year. For the majority of mankind’s early existence wild horses were hunted as a source of protein.<ref>{{Citation

However, because of the role horses have played as a companion and as a worker, and concerns about the [[ethics]] of the horse slaughter process, it is a [[taboo food]] in [[Horse_meat#Horse_meat_in_various_countries|some]] cultures. These historical associations, as well as ritual and [[Horse worship|religion]], led to the development of the aversion to the consumption of horse meat. The horse is now given pet status by many in some parts of the western world (particularly in the [[USA]] and [[UK]]), which further solidifies the taboo on eating its meat. This avoidance (and the loss of taste for it) is relatively modern, although it arises out of complex historical and cultural origins.

==History==
In the late Paleolithic ([[Magdalenian|Magdalenian Era]]), [[wild horse]]s formed an important source of food. In many parts of Europe, the consumption of horse meat continued throughout the Middle Ages until modern times, despite a Papal ban of horse meat in 732. Horse meat was also eaten as part of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan]] religious ceremonies in [[northern Europe]], particularly ceremonies associated with the worship of [[Odin]].

Domesticated horses and cattle did not exist in [[the Americas]] until the [[Age of Discovery]], and the [[Conquistadors]] owed much of their success to their [[war horse]]s. The Europeans' horses became [[feral horse|feral]], and were hunted by the indigenous [[Pehuenche]] people of what is now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].<ref>{{Citation

The meat was, and still is, preserved by being [[dried meat|sun-dried]] in the high [[Andes]] into a product known as ''[[charqui]]''.

[[France]] dates its taste for horse meat to [[French Revolution|the Revolution]]. With the fall of the aristocracy, its auxiliaries had to find new means of subsistence. Just as hairdressers and tailors set themselves up to serve commoners, the horses maintained by aristocracy as a sign of prestige ended up alleviating the hunger of lower classes.<ref name="Harris"/> It was during the Napoleonic campaigns when the surgeon-in-chief of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grand Army]], [[Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey]], advised the starving troops to eat the meat of horses. At the [[siege of Alexandria]], the meat of young [[Arab horse]]s relieved an epidemic of [[scurvy]]. At the [[battle of Eylau]] in 1807, Larrey served horse as soup and ''[[bœuf à la mode]]''. In [[battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]] (1809), cut from the supply lines, the cavalry used the [[horse armor|horses' breastplates]] as cooking pots and [[gunpowder]] as seasoning, and thus founded a tradition.<ref name="Musee">Larrey is quoted in French by Dr Béraud, ''[http://leslivresoublies.free.fr/leslivresoublies/Sciences_et_techniques_muse/cheval.html Études Hygiéniques de la chair de cheval comme aliment]'', Musée des Familles (1841-42).</ref><ref name="Parker">Larrey mentions in his memoirs how he fed the wounded after the  (1809) with  [[bouillon]] of horse meat seasoned with gunpowder.

Horse meat gained widespread acceptance in [[French cuisine]] during the later years of the [[Second French Empire]]. The high cost of living in [[Paris]] prevented many working-class citizens from buying meat such as [[pork]] or [[beef]], so in 1866 the French government legalized the eating of horse meat and the first butcher's shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris, providing quality meat at lower prices.<ref>Kari Weil, [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.44 "They Eat Horses, Don't They?

(doi:10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.44)</ref> During the [[Siege of Paris|Siege of 1870-71]], horse meat was eaten by anyone who could afford it, partly because of a shortage of fresh meat in the blockaded city, and also because horses were eating grain which was needed by the human populace.  Many Parisians gained a taste for horse meat during the siege, and after the war ended, horse meat remained popular.  Likewise, in other places and times of siege or starvation, horses are viewed as a food source of last resort.

Despite the general [[Anglosphere|Anglophone]] taboo, horse and donkey meat was eaten in Britain, especially in [[Yorkshire]], until the 1930s,<ref>''Eating Up Italy: Voyages on a Vespa'' by [[Matthew Fort]]. 2005, p253.

Horse is commonly eaten in many countries in Europe and Asia.<ref>{{Citation

Horse meat is not generally eaten in [[Spain]], although the country exports horses both "on the hoof and on the hook" (i.e., live animals and slaughtered meat) for the French and Italian market; however, horse meat is consumed in some [[Latin American]] countries such as [[Mexico]]. It is illegal in some countries. In [[Tonga]] horse meat is eaten nationally, and Tongan emigrees living in Utah have retained the taste for it, claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them.<ref>Simoons, F.J.,  1994,  Eat not this Flesh, Food Avoidances from Pre-history to Present,  University of Wisconsin Press.</ref>

In many [[Muslim countries]] today, horse meat is considered ''[[makruh]]'', meaning it is not forbidden, but strongly discouraged. One reason given for its prohibition is the need for horses in military and other uses, and as such, considering the decline in use of horses for such purposes, some consider its consumption permissible. Horse meat is eaten in some Muslim [[Central Asia]]n countries with a tradition of [[nomad]]ic [[pastoralism]], e.g., [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. In other [[majority-Muslim countries]] there have been many instances, especially wars and famine, when horses were slaughtered and eaten. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  In the past, horse has been eaten by [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Turkic people|Turks]], some [[hanafi]] [[Egyptian people|Egyptians]], and [[Tatar people|Tatars]]; but it has never been eaten in the [[Maghreb]].<ref>Françoise Aubaile-Sallenave, "Meat among Mediterranean Muslims: Beliefs and Praxis", ''Estudios del Hombre'' '''19''':129 (2004)</ref>

Horse meat is forbidden by [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] because horses do not have [[cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and they are not [[ruminants]]. It has been suggested that this holds a practical purpose as horses were used as a means of transportation and did work, although this is doubtful due to the lack of the [[horse collar]] at the time of the formation of these laws.

In the eighth century, Popes [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]] and [[Pope Zachary|Zachary]] instructed [[Saint Boniface]], missionary to the Germans, to forbid the eating of horse meat to those he converted, due to its association with Germanic pagan ceremonies.<ref>William Ian Miller, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026-2234(199108)89%3A8%3C2081%3AOOCHAW%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X "Of Outlaws, Christians, Horsemeat, and Writing: Uniform Laws and Saga Iceland"], ''Michigan Law Review'', Vol. 89, No. 8 (Aug., 1991), pp. 2081-2095 {{subscription|date=October 2010}}</ref><ref>Calvin W.

Horse meat is now currently consumed in Iceland and many horses are raised for this purpose.  The culturally close people of [[Sweden]] still have an ambivalent attitude to horse meat, said to stem from this time.

[[Henry Mayhew]] describes the difference in the acceptability and use of the horse carcass in London and Paris in ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''(1851).<ref>vol 2 p 7-9</ref> Horse meat was rejected by the British, but continued to be eaten in other European countries such as France and Germany, where knackers often sold horse carcasses underhand despite the Papal ban. Even the hunting of wild horses for meat continued in the area of [[Westphalia]]. Londoners also suspected that horse meat was finding its way into sausages, and that [[offal]] sold as that of oxen was in fact equine.  About 1000 horses were slaughtered a week.

===Reasons for the taboo===
In some countries the effects of this prohibition by the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] have lingered, and horse meat prejudices have progressed from [[taboos]], to avoidance, to abhorrence.<ref name=IGHA-USDA/> In other parts of the world, horse meat has the [[social stigma|stigma]] of being something poor people eat and is seen as a cheap substitute for other meats, such as [[pork]] and [[beef]].

According to the anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]]<ref name="Harris">{{Citation

|year=1998
|isbn=1577660153
|url=http://books.google.com/?id=B1oGAAAACAAJ}}</ref> some cultures class horse meat as taboo because the horse converts grass into meat less efficiently than [[ruminant]]s. When breeding cattle for meat, a cow or a sheep will produce more meat than a horse if fed with the same amount of grass.

There is also an element of sentimentality, as horses have long enjoyed a close relationship with many humans, on a similar level to household pets – this can be seen projected in such [[English language|Anglophone]] cultural icons such as ''[[Black Beauty]]'' and ''[[My Little Pony]]''. Compare with the [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals in ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'', ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', and [[Freddy the Pig]].

[[Totem]]istic taboo is also a possible reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources state that the goddess [[Epona]] was widely worshipped in [[Gaul]] and southern Britain. Epona, a triple aspect goddess, was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers, and horses were sacrificed to her;<ref>Powell, T. G. E., 1958, The Celts, Thames and Hudson, London</ref> she was paralleled by the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] [[Macha]] and [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] [[Rhiannon]].  The [[Uffington White Horse]] is probable evidence of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian [[Brahmin]]s engaged in horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yaghya) as recorded in the [[Vedas]]; but within context of the ritual sacrificial is not being 'killed' but instead being smothered to death.<ref name="Campbell 1962">Campbell, Joseph, ''Oriental Mythology: The Masks of God'', Arkana, 1962, pp190-197 ISBN 0-14-019442-8</ref> In 1913, the Finnic [[Mari people]] of the [[Volga]] region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice.<ref name="Campbell 1962"/>

In ancient [[Scandinavia]], the horse was very important, as a living, [[working animal|working creature]], as a sign of the [[social status|owner's status]], and symbolically within the old [[Norse religion]]. Horses were slaughtered as a [[sacrifice]] to the gods and the meat was eaten by the people taking part in the religious feasts.<ref>{{Citation

It is notable that, despite horses having been bred in England since pre-Roman times, the [[English language]] has no widely used term for horse meat, as opposed to four for [[pig]] meat ([[pork]], [[bacon]], [[ham]], gammon), three for [[sheep]] meat ([[Lamb (food)|lamb]], [[Lamb and mutton|hogget]] and [[mutton]]), two for cow meat ([[beef]] and [[veal]]), and so on.  [[English speaking countries]], however, have sometimes marketed horse meat under the [[euphemism]] "cheval meat" (''cheval'' being the [[French language|French]] for horse). Also, note that the words pork, bacon, mutton, veal, and beef all derive from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] vocabulary, because of the class structure of England after [[Norman conquest of England|the Norman Conquest]] in 1066 [[Common Era|CE]]: the poor (Saxons) tended the animals, while the rich (French-speaking Normans) ate the meat.  The peasants had very little to do with horses.

==Production==
In most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in a similar fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory [[slaughter house]]s (abattoirs) where they are [[stunning|stunned]] with a [[captive bolt gun]] and [[exsanguination|bled to death]]. In countries with a less industrialized food production system, horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed, in the village where they will be consumed, or near to it.<ref>C.J. Chivers, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/26/international/asia/26horse.html?hp&ex=1135659600&en=ebc2553086dd95e4&ei=5094&partner=homepage A Sure Thing for Kazakhs: Horses Will Provide] The New York Times</ref>

In 2005, the eight principal horse meat producing countries produced over 700,000 tonnes of this product.

As horses are relatively poor converters of grass and grain to meat compared to cattle,<ref name=Harris /> they are not usually bred or raised specifically for their meat.  Instead, horses are slaughtered when their monetary value as [[equitation|riding]] or [[draft animal|work animals]] is low, but their owners can still make money selling them for horse meat, as for example in the routine export of the [[south England|southern English]] ponies from the [[New Forest pony|New Forest]], [[Exmoor pony|Exmoor]], and [[Dartmoor pony|Dartmoor]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/new_forest_ponies_commoners_breed_improvements.shtml - BBC Inside Out - New Forest Ponies]</ref><ref name=countrysideonline237>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061007150933/http://www.countrysideonline.co.uk/plugins/content/content.php?content.237 - BBC Inside Out - NFU Countryside Online: Passports for Ponies] (archived from [http://www.countrysideonline.co.uk/plugins/content/content.php?content.237 the original] on 2006-10-07)</ref>  [[British law]] requires the use of "[[animal passport|equine passports]]" even for semi-[[wild horse]]s to enable [[traceability]] (also known as "provenance"), so most slaughtering is done in the UK before the meat is exported,<ref name=countrysideonline237 /> meaning that the animals travel "on the hook, not on the hoof" (as carcasses rather than live).

There is a misconception that horses are slaughtered for pet food, however. In many countries, like the United States, horse meat was outlawed in pet food in the 1970s. American horse meat is considered a delicacy in Europe and Japan, and its cost is in line with veal,<ref>[http://www.haras-nationaux.fr/portail/uploads/tx_vm19docsbase/DIP_ECO_03_HORSEMEAT_01.pdf Horsemeat in France] (June 2006), Librairie des Haras nationaux.</ref> so it would be prohibitively expensive in many countries for pet food.

== Preparation ==
[[Image:Horsemeatsandwich.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Smoked and salted horse meat on bread.]]
Horse meat has a slightly sweet taste reminiscent of a combination of beef and [[venison]]. Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color while older horses produce richer color and flavor, as with most [[mammals]]. Horse meat can be used to replace beef, pork, mutton, venison and any other meat in virtually any recipe, although the cooking time is shorter than that of beef or pork.  Horse meat is usually very lean and tender.  Jurisdictions which allow for the slaughter of horses for food rarely have age restrictions, so many are quite old. However, unlike many other types of meat, horse meat becomes more tender as the animal advances in age.

Those preparing [[sandwich]]es or cold meals with horse meat usually use it smoked and salted. Horse meat forms an ingredient in several traditional recipes of [[salami]].

==Horse meat in various countries==

====Australia====
Australians do not generally eat horse meat, although they have a horse slaughter industry that exports to Japan, Europe, and Russia.<ref>[http://sagowarrior.com/anip/report.pdf Exporting red meat to Russia: Understanding the context], 7 October 2010. Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref> Horse meat exports peaked at 9,327 tons 1986, declining to 3,000 tons in 2003. The two abattoirs in Australia licensed to export horse meat are Belgian-owned. They are at Peterborough in South Australia (Metro Velda Pty Ltd) and Caboolture abattoir in Queensland (Meramist Pty Ltd).<ref>[http://www.optimail.com.au/berrime/slaughter.htm Horse slaughter and horsemeat: the facts]</ref> A British agriculture industry website reported that Australian horse meat production levels had risen to 24,000 tons by 2009.<ref name=farminguk2009-01-17 />

On 30 June 2010, Agriculture Minister [[Terry Redman]] granted final approval to [[Western Australia]] butcher Vince Garreffa to sell horse meat for human consumption. Nedlands restaurateur Pierre Ichallalene announced plans to do a taster on [[Bastille Day]] and to put horse meat dishes on the menu if there's a good reaction. Mr. Redman said that the Government would "consider extending approvals should the public appetite for horse demand it".<ref name=thewest7492421>Bob Broadfield, [http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/latest/7492421/butcher-gives-horse-meat-a-run/ Butcher gives horse meat a run], [http://au.news.yahoo.com au.news.yahoo.com].</ref>

Mr. Garreffa is the owner of Mondo Di Carne, a major wholesale meat supplier which supplies many cafes restaurants & hotels in Western Australia.<ref>[http://www.mondo.net.au/data/retail.html Welcome to the Mondo's Family];<br />

By July 2, an online petition had been created to stop the sale of horse meat for human consumption in Western Australia.<ref>[http://www.change.org/petitions/view/stop_the_sale_of_horse_meat_for_human_consumption_in_western_australia Stop the sale of horse meat for human consumption in Western Australia], [http://www.change.org change.org].</ref> This decision has caused some outrage with a petition started to be signed to overturn this decision from the Department of Agriculture. However several local newspaper forums indicated that the general public were not greatly biased either way, in fact many voiced their openness for alternate meats. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====China====
{{See also|Chinese cuisine}}
Horse meat is not available in most parts of China, although it is generally acceptable to Chinese. Its lack of popularity is mostly due to its low availability and some rumors saying that horse meat tastes bad or it is bad for health, even [[poison]]ous. In ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'', a [[pharmaceutical]] text published in 1596, [[Li Shizhen]] wrote "To relieve toxin caused by eating horse meat, one can drink [[carrot juice]] and eat [[almond]]." Today, in southern China, there are locally famous dishes such as Horse Meat [[Rice vermicelli|Rice Vermicelli]] (马肉米粉) in [[Guilin]]. In the northwest, [[Kazakhs]] eat horse meat (see [[Horse meat#Kazakhstan|below]]). In Hebei province and Beijing, Donkey Burger （驴肉火烧） is a popular snack.Donkey Burger is made of stewed donkey meat in a baked Chinese bun. The two most popular versions of Donkey Burger originate from Hejian and Baoding in Hebei province.<ref>[http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/metro-beijing/lifestyle/health&food/2010-03/516236.html Donkey meat: the most traditional way to get a piece of ass] (March 26, 2010), Global Times.</ref><ref>[http://www.shopping-in-beijing.com/beijingshops/donkey-meat-restaurant-313.html Fatty Wang’s Donkey Burgers (王胖子绿肉火烧)] (August 17, 2010), [http://www.shopping-in-beijing.com shopping-in-beijing.com].</ref>

====Kazakhstan====
{{See also|Kazakh cuisine}}In [[Kazakhstan]] horse meat is a large part of the diet, due mainly to the nomadic roots of the population.<ref>[http://www.foodbycountry.com/Kazakhstan-to-South-Africa/Kazakhstan.html "Food in Kazakhstan"]. ''Food in Every Country''. Referenced 5/6/08.</ref> Some of the dishes include sausages called ''kazy'' and ''shuzhuk'' made from the meat using the guts as the sausage skin, ''zhaya'' made from hip meat which is smoked and boiled, ''zhal'' made from neck fat which is smoked and boiled, ''karta'' made from a section of the rectum which is smoked and boiled, and ''sur-yet'' which is kept as dried meat.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080610023546/http://www.zheruik.kz/rus/traditions/meet1.php Horse meat dishes in Kazakhstan].

In [[Indonesia]], one type of [[satay]] (chunks of grilled meat served with spicy sauce) known as Horse Satay ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]:''sate jaran'', [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]:''sate kuda'') is made from horse meat.  This delicacy from [[Yogyakarta]] is served with sliced fresh [[shallot]] (small red onion), pepper, and sweet soy sauce.<ref>

====Japan====
{{See also|Japanese cuisine}}
[[Image:Horse-meat.jpg|thumb|left|''Basashi'' from [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]]]]In [[Japan]]ese [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], raw horse meat is called ''sakura'' (桜) or ''sakuraniku'' (桜肉, ''sakura'' means [[cherry blossom]], ''niku'' means meat) because of its pink color.  It can be served raw as [[sashimi]] in thin slices dipped in soy sauce, often with ginger and onions added. In this case, it is called ''basashi'' ({{lang-ja|馬刺し}}). ''Basashi'' is popular in some regions of Japan and is often served at ''[[izakaya]]''.  Fat, typically from the neck, is also found as ''basashi'', though it is white, not pink.  Horse meat is also sometimes found on menus for ''[[yakiniku]]'' (a type of barbecue), where it is called ''baniku'' (馬肉, literally, "horse meat") or ''bagushi'' (馬串, "skewered horse"); thin slices of raw horse meat are sometimes served wrapped in a [[perilla|shiso leaf]]. [[Kumamoto prefecture|Kumamoto]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]] and [[Ōita Prefecture|Ōita]] are famous for ''basashi'', and it is common in the [[Tohoku region]] as well. Some types of canned "corned meat" in Japan include horse as one of the ingredients.<ref>[http://www.puntofocal.gov.ar/notific_otros_miembros/jpn163_t.pdf Brief Overview of the Draft Revision of Quality Labeling Standard for Canned and Bottled Livestock Products], Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (from [http://www.puntofocal.gov.ar PuntoFocal Argentina]).</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CBoQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.moit.gov.il%2FNR%2Frdonlyres%2FAFFC01EB-9F99-4C1D-AA7F-6F52C1DD6155%2F0%2FNot0116JPN163.doc&ei=8TV3TOHoMIuqca-L9fcF&usg=AFQjCNGtYj7JCVG65qtgIVTUPAEEYSYDGA&sig2=qy31w64MvfcujMQGPgyn4A NOTIFICATION], World Trade Organization, 16 January 2006.</ref> There is also a dessert made from horse meat called ''basashi'' ice cream.<ref>{{Citation

[[Mongolia]], a nation famous for its nomadic pastures and equestrian skills, also includes horse meat on the menu.  Mongolians also make a horse milk wine, called airag. Salted horse meat sausages called ''kazy'' are produced as a regional delicacy by the Kazakhs in [[Bayan-Ölgii]] aimag.<ref>{{Citation

===Europe===
====Austria====
{{See also|Austrian cuisine}}[[Image:Pferdeleberkäse Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Fast food shop selling horse ''Leberkäse'' (''Pferdeleberkäse'') in [[Vienna]]]]
Horse ''[[Leberkäse]]'' is available and quite popular at various hot dog stands.  Dumplings can also be prepared with horse meat, spinach or Tyrolean ''Graukäse'' (a sour milk cheese).  They are occasionally eaten on their own, in a soup, or as a side-dish.

====Belgium====
{{See also|Belgian cuisine}}
In Belgium, horse meat (''paardenvlees'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and ''viande chevaline'' in French) is highly prized.  It is used in [[steak tartare]], in which, compared to the beef equivalent, the richer flavor of the horse meat lends itself better to the pungent seasoning used in preparation {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  Besides being served raw, it can be broiled for a short period, producing a crusty exterior and a raw, moist interior.  Smoked horse meat is very popular as breakfast and sandwich meat. Horse steaks are also very popular; the city of [[Vilvoorde]] has a few restaurants specializing in this dish. Horse-sausage is a well known local specialty in [[Lokeren]] with European recognition.

====France====

[[File:Chevaline Pezenas.jpg|thumb|280|A butcher shop specializing in horse meat in Pezenas, Languedoc, France.]]
{{See also|French cuisine}}In France, specialized butcher shops (''boucheries chevalines'') sell horse meat, as ordinary butcher shops have been for a long time forbidden to deal in it. However, since the 1990s, it can be found in supermarket butcher shops and others.

====Germany====
{{See also|German cuisine}}In [[Germany]], horse meat is occasionally used in ''[[Sauerbraten]]'', a strongly marinated type of sweet-sour braised meat dish. Other traditional horse meat dishes include the [[Bavaria]]n ''Rosswurst'' (horse sausage). In recent times, the eating of horse meat has become a controversial issue and beef is nowadays often substituted for the horse meat in Sauerbraten. However, horse meat, sold by specialized ''Pferdemetzgereien'' (horse butcheries), is still occasionally used for steaks, roasts and goulash by many people in all parts of Germany, since it is supposed to be healthier than beef and pork while being cheaper than venison. It is however far from a common supermarket item. Especially cat and dog breeders and owners value horse meat as a lean and healthy pet food.

====Hungary====
{{See also|Hungarian cuisine}}In [[Hungary]] horse meat is only used in salami and sausages, usually mixed with [[pork]]. These products are sold in most supermarkets and many butcher shops and are not very popular.

====Iceland====
{{See also|Cuisine of Iceland}}In [[Iceland]] it is both eaten minced and as steak, also used in [[stew]]s and [[fondue]], prized for its strong flavor. It has a particular role in the culture and history of the island, as its consumption was one of the concessions won when the pagan Norse [[Icelanders]] eventually [[Christianisation of Iceland#Adoption by arbitration|adopted Christianity]] in the year 1000.

====Italy====
[[Image:macelleria equina venezia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Venice|Venetian]] horse meat [[butcher]]]]{{See also|Italian cuisine}}
[[Italian cuisine]] is highly regional: thus, horse meat is popular e.g. in [[Veneto]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], or in [[Sardinia]]; while it not very popular in most part of Italy, used just by a few consumers or even seen as a bad thing (like eating a pet). Horse meat is used in a stew called ''pastissada'' (typical of [[Verona]]), served as horse or colt steaks, as [[carpaccio]], or made into [[bresaola]]. Horse fat is used in recipes such as ''[[b:Cookbook:Pezzetti di Cavallo|pezzetti di cavallo]]''. In the region of [[Veneto]] a dish is prepared which consists of shredded, cured horse meat on a bed of [[arugula]], dressed with olive oil and fresh lemon juice. Also in Veneto, horse meat sausages called ''salsiccia di equino'' or salami; and thin strips of horse meat called ''sfilacci'' are sold (a popular local pizza is made with ''sfilacci'' on it).  The straight horse meat steak ''carne di cavallo'', similar to classic American [[Porterhouse steak]], is generally available in the [[Province of Bolzano-Bozen|Alto Adige/Südtirol]] region of the [[Italian Alps]]; while in Veneto a smaller horse steak is typical and often called, with a [[Venetian Language|Venetian]] name, ''straeca''. In Sardinia [[sa pezz'e cuaddu]]is one of the most renowned meat and it's also sold in typical kiosks with bread [[panino con carne di cavallo]]. Chefs and consumers tend to prize its uniqueness by serving it as rare as possible.  [[Donkey]] is also cooked, for example as a pasta sauce called ''stracotto d'asino''.  According to British food writer [[Matthew Fort]], "The taste for donkey and horse goes back to the days when these animals were part of everyday agricultural life.  In the frugal, unsentimental manner of agricultural communities, all the animals were looked on as a source of protein.  Waste was not an option."<ref>Eating Up Italy: Voyages on a Vespa by [[Matthew Fort]]. 2005, p253-254. ISBN 0-00-721481-2</ref>

====Norway====
{{See also|Norwegian cuisine}}
In Norway horse meat is commonly used in cured meats, such as vossakorv and svartpølse, and less commonly as steak, hestebiff.

In pre-Christian Norway, horse was seen as an expensive animal. To eat a horse was to show that you had great wealth, and to sacrifice a horse to the gods was seen as the greatest gift you could give. When Norwegians adopted Christianity, horse-eating became taboo as it was a religious act for pagans, and thus it was considered a sign of heresy.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jochens|first=Jenny |title=Women in Old Norse Society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3h-lkgBWercC|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801485206|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=3h–lkgBWercC&pg=PA87 87–88]}}</ref>

Used in production of ''[[kabanos]]'', recently declining in popularity. Live, old horses are often being exported to Italy to be slaughtered. This practice also garners controversy. Horses in Poland are treated mostly as companions and majority of society is against the live export to Italy. You can find some shelters for old and unwanted horses that are rescued from slaughter, The Tara Rescue and The Animals of Eulalia Faundation.

====Serbia====

Horse meat is generally available in [[Serbia]], and is highly popular in the traditional cuisine. It is often recommended by General Practitioners to persons who suffers from lack of red blood cells. It is widely available to buy at Farmers' markets.

====Slovenia====
{{See also|Slovenian cuisine}}
Horse meat is generally available in [[Slovenia]], and is highly popular in the traditional cuisine, especially in the central region of [[Carniola]] and in the [[Kras]] region. Colt steak (''žrebičkov zrezek'') is available in some restaurants and there is a popular fast-food restaurant in [[Ljubljana]] called Hot-Horse that serves hamburgers made of horse meat.<ref>{{Citation

====Sweden====
{{See also|Swedish cuisine}}
Smoked/cured horse meat is widely available as a [[cold cut]] under the name ''hamburgerkött'' (hamburger meat). It tends to be very thinly sliced and fairly salty, slightly reminiscent of deli-style ham. ''Gustafskorv'', a smoked sausage made from horse meat, is also quite popular, especially in the province of Dalarna, where it's made. It is similar to [[salami]] or [[medwurst]] and is used as an alternative to them on sandwiches. It is also possible to order horse beef from some well-stocked grocery stores.

====Switzerland====
{{See also|Swiss cuisine}}
In [[Switzerland]] horse meat may be used in [[Fondue#Fondue Bourguignonne|Fondue Bourguignonne]]. Horse steak is also quite common, especially in the French-speaking West, but also more and more in the German-speaking part. A speciality known as ''mostbröckli'' is made with beef or horse meat. Horse meat is also used for a great range of sausages in the German-speaking North of Switzerland. Like in Northern Italy, in the Italian-speaking South, local "salametti" (sausages) are sometimes made with horse meat.

====United Kingdom====
{{See also|British cuisine}}
In the United Kingdom the slaughter, preparation and consumption of horses for food is not against the law, although in practice it has been out of fashion since the 1930s and there is a strong taboo against it.  It was eaten when other meats were scarce, such as during times of war<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/foodprogramme_20040425.shtml - Food Programme,  April 2004]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/25/a7269825.shtml - BBC - WW2 People's War - Horsemeat, A Wedding Treat]</ref> (as was [[whale meat]], never popular and now also taboo).  The sale of horse meat in supermarkets and butchers is minimal, and most of the horse meat consumed in the UK is imported from Europe, predominantly the [[South of France]], where it is more widely available.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/06/nramsay06.xml - We Should Eat Horse Meat]</ref>
Horse meat may be consumed inadvertently. A [[2003]] [[Food Standards Agency]] investigation revealed that [[salami]] and similar products such as [[chorizo]] and [[pastrami]]  sometimes contain horse meat, without this ingredient being listed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2963554.stm Horse meat found in salami], BBC News, june 4, 2003.</ref> Listing is legally required.<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/foodlabelling/ull/ UK labelling laws]</ref>

====Ukraine====
In Ukraine, especially in Crimea and other southern steppe regions, horse meat is consumed in the form of sausages called Mahan and Sudzhuk. These particular sausages are traditional food of the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] population.

===North America===
====Canada====
{{See also|Canadian cuisine}}
Agriculture in [[Quebec]] seems to prosper under the prohibitions from the United States.  There is a thriving horse meat business in [[Culture of Quebec|Quebec]]; the meat is available in most supermarket chains.  Horse meat is also for sale at the other end of the country, in [[Granville Island]] Market in [[downtown Vancouver]] where, according to a [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] reviewer who smuggled it into the United States, it turned out to be a "sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, closer to beef than venison".<ref name=Time2007-02-08>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1587279,00.html "Horse — It's What's for Dinner"] by Joel Stein, Time magazine, 8 February 2007.</ref> Horse meat is also available in high end [[Toronto]] butchers and supermarkets. Aside from the heritage of French cuisine at one end of the country and the adventurous [[foodie]]s of Vancouver at the other, however, the majority of [[Canada]] shares the horse meat taboo with the rest of the [[Anglosphere]]. This mentality is especially evident in [[Alberta]], where strong [[horse racing]] and breeding industries and cultures have existed since the province's founding.

====United States====
{{See also|Cuisine of the United States}}
{{See also|Horse slaughter#The underlying issue in the United States}}
Horse meat is rarely eaten in the United States. Horses are raised instead as pets, for working purposes (border patrol, police work, and ranching), or for sport. Horse meat holds a very similar taboo in American culture, the same as the one found in the United Kingdom previously described, except that it is rarely even imported.

Restriction of human consumption of horse meat in the U.S. has generally involved legislation at the state and local levels. In 1915, for example, the [[New York City]] Board of Health amended the sanitary code, making it legal to sell horse meat.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03EFD61239E333A25751C2A9649D946496D6CF ALLOW HORSE MEAT FOR FOOD IN CITY] The New York Times, 22 December 1915</ref> During [[World War II]], due to the low supply and high price of beef, [[New Jersey]] legalized its sale, but at war's end, the state again prohibited the sale of horse meat.

In 1951, Time magazine reported from Portland, Ore.: “Horsemeat, hitherto eaten as a stunt or only as a last resort, was becoming an important item on Portland tables. Now there were three times as many horse butchers, selling three times as much meat.” Noting that “people who used to pretend it was  [[dog food|for the dog]] now came right out and said it was going on the table,” and providing tips for cooking pot roast of horse and equine fillets. A similar situation unfolded in 1973, when inflation raised the cost of traditional meats. Time reported that “Carlson’s, a butcher shop in Westbrook, Conn., that recently converted to horse meat exclusively, now sells about 6,000 pounds of the stuff a day.” The shop produced a 28-page guide called “Carlson’s Horsemeat Cook Book,” with recipes for chili con carne, German meatballs, beery horsemeat, and more.<ref>{{Citation

====Chile====
{{See also|Chilean cuisine}}
In [[Chile]] it is used in ''[[charqui]]''. Both in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] horse meat was the main source of nutrition for the nomadic indigenous tribes of the [[pampas]], which promptly switched from a [[guanaco]] -based economy to a horse-based one when the horses brought by the Spaniards bred naturally and became feral. This applies specially for the [[Pampa]] and [[Mapuche]] nations, who become fierce warriors on horseback. Pretty much like the [[Tatars]], they ate raw horse meat and milked their animals.
