The '''Olympic Games''' are a major international event featuring summer and winter sports, in which thousands of athletes participate in a [[multi-sport event|variety of competitions]]. The Games are currently held every two years, with [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games]] alternating, although they occur every four years within their respective seasonal games. Since 2008, host cities are contracted to manage both the Olympic and the [[Paralympic Games]], <ref name=Parahist/> where athletes who have a [[physical disability]] compete. The Paralympics are held immediately following their respective Olympic Games. Originally, the [[ancient Olympic Games]] were held in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 5th century AD. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] founded the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894. The [[IOC]] has since become the governing body of the [[Olympic Movement]], whose structure and actions are defined by the [[Olympic Charter]].

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Games for ice and snow sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a physical disability, and the [[Youth Olympic Games]] for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to the varying economic, political, and technological realities of the 20th century. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allow participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of the [[mass media]] created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games. World Wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.

The Olympic Movement consists of [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs), [[National Olympic Committee|National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Olympic Games. The host city is responsible for organizing and funding a celebration of the Games consistent with the Olympic Charter. The Olympic program, consisting of the [[Olympic sports|sports]] to be contested at the Games, is also determined by the IOC. The celebration of the Games encompasses many rituals and symbols, such as the [[Olympic flag]] and [[Olympic torch|torch]], as well as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening and closing ceremonies]]. There are over 13,000 athletes that compete at the Summer and Winter Olympics in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events.  The first, second, and third place finishers in each event receive gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.

The Games have grown in scale to the point that nearly every nation is represented. Such growth has created numerous challenges, including [[Olympic boycotts|boycotts]], [[Use of performance enhancing drugs at the Olympic Games|doping]], [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery of officials]], and [[Munich massacre|terrorism]]. Every two years, the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national, and in particular cases, international fame. The Games also constitute a major opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

The Ancient Olympic Games was a series of competitions held between representatives of several [[city-states]] and kingdoms from [[Ancient Greece]], which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games all struggles against the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=2000|edition=2|pages=54|isbn=0292703732|oclc=10759486|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2-HQMnDiLqIC&printsec=frontcover#PPA54,M1|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> The origin of these Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend.<ref>Young (2004), p. 12</ref> One of the most popular myths identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the progenitors of the Games.<ref name=elis1-7-9>Pausanias, "Elis 1", VII, p.

Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a "[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: στάδιον, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', "stage"), which later became a [[Stadia (length)|unit of distance]]. Another myth associates the first Games with the ancient Greek concept of Olympic truce (ἐκεχειρία, ''ekecheiria'').<ref>Spivey (2004), pp. 229&ndash;230</ref> The most widely accepted date for the inception of the Ancient Olympics is 776&nbsp;BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, of the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Games|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/59589/The-ancient-Olympic-Games|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|format=registration required|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>  The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, and equestrian events.<ref>Crowther (2007) pp. 59&ndash;61</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient Olympic Events|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/sports.html|publisher=Perseus Project of [[Tufts University]]|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>  Tradition has it that [[Coroebus of Elis|Coroebus]], a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion.<ref>Golden (2009), p. 24</ref>

The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|famous statue]] by [[Phidias]] stood in his temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia.  Pelops was famous for his chariot race with [[Oenomaus|King Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisatis]].<ref name="Burkert">Burkert (1983), p. 95</ref>  The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues.<ref name="Ancient Gods IOC">{{cite web |url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/gods_uk.asp |title = Ancient Olympic Games &ndash; Gods |publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate= 2009-01-31}}</ref><ref>Swadling (1999), pp. 90&ndash;93</ref> The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an [[Olympiad]], was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the [[Panhellenic Games]], which included the [[Pythian Games]], the [[Nemean Games]], and the [[Isthmian Games]].<ref>Olympic Museum, "The Olympic Games in Antiquity", p. 2</ref>

The Olympic Games reached their [[zenith]] in the 6th and 5th&nbsp;centuries&nbsp;BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power and influence in Greece. There is no consensus on when the Games officially ended, the most common-held date is 393&nbsp;AD, when the emperor [[Theodosius I]] declared that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.<ref>However, Theodosius' decree contains no specific reference to Olympia (Crowther (2007), p. 54).</ref>  Another date cited is 426&nbsp;AD, when his successor [[Theodosius II]] ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.<ref>Crowther (2007), p. 54</ref> After the demise of the Olympics, they were not held again until the late 19th century.

== Modern Games ==
=== Forerunners ===
{{See|Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Zappas Olympics}}

[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|right|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]]]]
An attempt to emulate the ancient Olympic Games was the ''L'Olympiade de la République'', a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]].<ref name=frencholympics>{{cite web |url= http://www.lepotentiel.com/afficher_supplement.php?id_article=68524&id_supplement=8&id_edition=4405 |title= Histoire et évolution des Jeux olympiques |work= Potentiel |year= 2005|language=French |accessdate= 2009-01-31}}</ref> The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the [[metric system]] into sport.<ref name=frencholympics/>

In 1850 an Olympian Class, to improve the fitness of locals, was started by Dr [[William Penny Brookes]] at [[Much Wenlock]], in [[Shropshire]], England. In 1859, Dr Brookes renamed<ref>Young (2004), p. 144</ref> the Olympian Class to [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Wenlock Olympian Games]] and this annual games continues to this day. The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Dr Brookes on November 15, 1860.<ref name=Young>Young (1996)</ref>{{rp|28}}

Between 1862 and 1867, [[Liverpool]] held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by [[John Hulley]] and [[Charles Melly]], in cooperation with Dr Brookes, these games were elitist in nature since only Gentlemen could compete.<ref>George R. Matthews (2005). ''America's first Olympics: the St. Louis games of 1904'' University of Missouri Press ISBN 9780826215888</ref><ref>Ingomar Weiler (2004). ''The predecessors of the Olympic movement, and Pierre de Coubertin'' European Review, Vol. 12, No. 3, Cambridge University Press</ref><ref name=Young31>Young (1996), p. 31</ref> Some of the Gentlemen brought their coaches with them.<ref name=Young31>Young (1996), p. 31</ref> The programme for Athens 1896 has some similarities to that of the Liverpool Olympics but that was to be expected since Dr Brookes had incorporated events from the 1859 Athens Olympics program at Much Wenlock and had contributed to the programme at Liverpool.<ref>Craig Reedie, Jim Parry, Vassil Girginov (2005). ''The Olympic Games Explained: A Student Guide to the Evolution of the Modern Olympic Games'' Routledge ISBN: 9780415346047</ref> In 1865 Hulley, Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the [[British Olympic Association]]. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the [[Olympic Charter|International Olympic Charter]].<ref name=Young24>Young (1996), p. 24</ref>

None of the above forerunners built or used a stadium and the Wenlock Olympian Games that still goes on today does not have a stadium.

=== Revival ===

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1821.  It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor [[Panagiotis Soutsos]] in his poem "Dialogue of the Dead", published in 1833.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|1}} [[Evangelis Zappas]], a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|14}} Zappas sponsored the first [[Zappas Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1859, which was held in an [[Athens]] city square.  Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [[Panathenaic stadium]] so that it could host all future Olympic Games.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|14}}

Dr Brookes adopted events from the program of the Olympics held in Athens in 1859 in to future [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Wenlock Olympian Games]]. In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized by Dr. [[William Penny Brookes]] at London's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml |title= Much Wenlock & the Olympian Connection |publisher= Wenlock Olympian Society |accessdate= 2009-01-31}}</ref>

The [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|2, 13&ndash;23, 81}} Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870 though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|44}}  In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee.<ref name=wenlock>{{cite news |title=Rugby School motivated founder of Games|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/olympics/2004/07/07/bc.sport.olympics.coubertin/|work=Reuters|publisher=SI.com|date=2004-07-08|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>  Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.<ref name=wenlock/> He presented these ideas during the first [[Olympic Congress]] of the newly created [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). This meeting was held from June 16 to June 23, 1894, at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] University in [[Paris]]. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games, to come under the auspices of the IOC, would take place two years later in Athens.<ref>Coubertin, Philemon, Politis & Anninos (1897), Part 2, p. 8</ref>  The IOC elected the Greek writer [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|100&ndash;105}}

[[Image:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|The opening ceremony in the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]]]]

The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the [[Panathenaic stadium]] in [[Athens]] in 1896.  These Games brought 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/Athens-1896/ |title=Athens 1896 |publisher=The International Olympic Committee |accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>  Zappas and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]] had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games.

The Greek officials and public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting these Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the host of the Olympic Games on a permanent basis. The IOC did not approve this request.  The committee planned that the modern Olympics would rotate internationally.  As such they decided to hold the [[1900 Olympic Games|second Games]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate= January 31, 2009}}</ref>

=== Changes and adaptations ===
{{Main|Summer Olympic Games}}

Following the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris [[Exposition]] in 1900 and the [[World's Fair]] at St. Louis in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] were side-shows. The Games at Paris did not have a stadium, however this was the first time women took part in the games. The St. Louis Games hosted 650 athletes, but 580 were from the [[United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics|United States]]. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://proxy.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904 |title= St. Louis 1904 — Overview |publisher= ESPN  |accessdate= 2009-01-31}}</ref> The Games rebounded when the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third [[Olympiad]]) were held in Athens. These Games are not officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. These Games, which were hosted at the [[Panathenaic stadium]] in Athens, attracted a broad international field of participants, and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |title= 1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 2008-05-28 |accessdate= 2009-01-31}}</ref>

==== Winter Games ====
{{Main|Winter Olympic Games}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05472, St. Moritz, Winterolympiade.jpg|thumb|Ice hockey game during the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in [[St. Moritz]]]]
The Winter Olympics were created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games.  Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics.  The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities.  At the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Olympic Congress]], in [[Lausanne]], it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games.  A winter sports week (it was actually 11&nbsp;days) was held in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France; this event became the first [[Winter Olympic Games]].<ref name=chamonix>{{cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1924 |title= Chamonix 1924 |publisher= International Olympic Committee  |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |title= Winter Olympics History |publisher= Utah Athletic Foundation  |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>  This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Olympics were held on the third year of each Olympiad.

==== Paralympics ====
{{Main|Paralympic Games}}
In 1948, [[Ludwig Guttman|Sir Ludwig Guttman]], determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after [[World War II]], organized a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]]. Guttman's event, known then as the [[World Wheelchair and Amputee Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, Guttman and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]], in [[Rome]], Guttman brought 400 athletes to compete in the "Parallel Olympics", which became known as the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Paralympics]]. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year.  As of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm |title= History of the Paralympics |publisher= [[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2009-02-02 | date=2008-09-04}}</ref> In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.<ref name=Parahist>{{Cite web|title=History of the Paralympic Games|publisher=Government of Canada|url=http://www.canada2010.gc.ca/101/histor/010203-eng.cfm|accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> The agreement came into effect at the Summer Games in Beijing 2008, and the Winter Games in Vancouver 2010.

==== Youth Games ====
{{Main|Youth Olympic Games}}

Starting in 2010, the Olympic Games will be complemented by Youth Games, where athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 will compete.

=== Recent games ===
From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 countries at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=iocfactsheet>{{cite web |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1138.pdf |title= IOC Factsheet |publisher= International Olympic Committee |format= PDF  |accessdate= 2009-02-02}}</ref>  The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, [[Turin]] hosted 2,508 athletes from 80 countries competing in 84 events, during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006 |title= Turin 2006 |publisher= International Olympic Committee  |accessdate= 2008-08-26}}</ref>  During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the [[Olympic village]].  This village is intended to be a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants.  It is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing to build convenient Olympic village|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

The IOC allows nations to compete that do not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to set up their own National Olympic Committees.  Examples of this include territories such as Puerto Rico, Bermuda, and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|page=61|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations, recognized media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the [[Olympic Charter]].<ref name="movement">{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/index_uk.asp|title=The Olympic Movement|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> As the umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.<ref name="movement roles">{{cite web|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_843.pdf|title=Roles and responsibilities during the Olympic Games|date=February 2008|publisher=International Olympic Committee|pages=1–2|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> 
The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:
* [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IFs) are the [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football ([[FIFA]]) is the IF for [[Association football|football (soccer)]], and the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball ([[FIVB]]) is the international governing body for [[volleyball]]. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.<ref>{{cite web |title=For the Good of the Athletes|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|date=2007-10-31|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>
* [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country. For example, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) is the NOC of the [[United States]]. There are currently 205 NOCs recognized by the IOC.<ref name=iocfactsheet/>
* Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) constitute the temporary committees responsible for the organization of a specific celebration of the Olympics. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games, once the final report is delivered to the IOC.

[[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are the official languages of the Olympic Movement.  The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country.  Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country.<ref>Olympic Charter (2007), Rule 24, p. 53.</ref>

=== Criticism ===
The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization, with several members on the committee for life. The leadership of IOC presidents [[Avery Brundage]] and [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] was especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from untoward political involvement.<ref name=brundage>Maraniss (2008), pp. 52&ndash;60</ref> He was accused of both racism, for his handling of the [[apartheid]] issue with the [[South Africa at the Olympics|South African]] delegation, and [[anti-Semitism]].<ref>Maraniss (2008), pp. 60&ndash;69</ref> Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both [[nepotism]] and corruption.<ref>{{cite news |title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2001-05-18|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> Samaranch's ties with the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]] in Spain were also a source of criticism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympics:Barcelona Profile; Samaranch, Under the Gun Shoots Back|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1992-06-30|work=New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB173FF933A05755C0A964958260|accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>

In 1998, it was uncovered that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from members of the [[Salt Lake City]] bid committee for the hosting of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], to ensure their votes were cast in favor of the American bid. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that would change the way host cities are selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge Drops Olympic Bid Case|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=2003-12-06|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/06/sports/sp-saltlakecity6|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>

A [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: Buying the Games'', aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="Buying the Games">{{cite news|title=Buying the Games|last=Rowlatt|first=Justin|publisher=BBC|date=2004-07-29|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3937425.stm|accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>  The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games,<ref>{{cite news|first=Lynn|last=Zinser|title=London Wins 2012 Olympics New York Lags|work=The New York Times|date=2005-07-07|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/sports/othersports/07olympic.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> [[Paris]]ian Mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]] specifically accused the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic champion [[Sebastian Coe]]) of breaking the bid rules. He cited French President [[Jacques Chirac]] as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Paris Mayor Slams London Tactics|publisher=Sportinglife.com|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/london2012/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=others/05/07/06/manual_125524.html|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> The allegation was never fully explored. The [[Turin]] [[Bids for the 2006 Winter Olympics|bid]] for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, [[Marc Hodler]], strongly connected with the rival bid of [[Sion, Switzerland]], alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.<ref>{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=National Public Radio|date=2006-02-07|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>

== Commercialization ==
{{Main|Cost of the Olympic Games}}

The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors.  It was not until the retirement of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]], in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.<ref name=chen231>Cooper-Chen (2005), p. 231</ref>  Under the leadership of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.<ref name=television/>

===Budget===
During the first half of the 20th century the IOC was run on a small budget.<ref name=television/><ref name=mallonci>Buchanon & Mallon (2006), p. ci</ref>  As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.<ref name=chen231/>  Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.<ref name=chen231/>  Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organizing committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.<ref name=chen231/>  When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2&nbsp;million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45&nbsp;million.<ref name=chen231/>  This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.<ref name=chen231/>  When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.<ref name=mallonci/>

The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] became a watershed moment in Olympic history.  The Los Angeles-based organizing committee, led by [[Peter Ueberroth]], was able to generate a surplus of US$225&nbsp;million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time.<ref name=pelle209>Findling & Pelle (2000), p. 209</ref>  The organizing committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.<ref name=pelle209/>  The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights.  Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Program (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand.<ref name=television/>  Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50&nbsp;million for a four year membership.<ref name=mallonci/>  Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the [[Olympic rings|interlocking rings]], in their publications and advertisements.<ref name=slack194>Slack (2004), p. 194</ref>

===Effect of television===
The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Berlin 1936|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1936|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref>  The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] were the first internationally televised Olympic Games,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cortina d'Ampezzo|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1956|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref> and the [[1960 Winter Olympics|following Winter Games]] had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialized television broadcasting networks—[[CBS]] paid US$394,000 for the American rights,<ref name=slack192>Slack (2004), p. 192</ref> and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) allocated US$660,000.<ref name="television" /> In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War.  Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.<ref name=slack192/>  The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers who purchased advertising time on television.  This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.<ref name=slack192/>  For example, CBS paid US$375&nbsp;million for the rights of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Games]],<ref>Gershon (2000), p. 17</ref> while [[NBC]] spent US$3.5&nbsp;billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.<ref name=television>{{cite web|title=Issues of the Olympic Games|work=Olympic Primer|publisher=LA84 Foundation of Los Angeles|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/primer_text2.htm|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>

Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of color television in 1968.<ref>Whannel, G. (1984) The television spectacular In A. Tomlinson & G. Whannel (Eds.), Five-ring circus (pp. 30–43). London: Pluto Press</ref> Global audience estimates for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Games]] was 600&nbsp;million, whereas at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Games of 1984]], the audience numbers had increased to 900&nbsp;million; that number swelled to 3.5&nbsp;billion by the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].<ref>Tomlinson (2005), p. 14</ref>  However, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] in [[Sydney]], NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968.<ref>{{cite news|title=World Series TV ratings slump|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/sports/main244877.shtml|work=CBS News|publisher=Associated Press|year=2000|accessdate=2009-05-04 | date=2000-10-27}}</ref>  This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era.<ref>{{cite news|title=All fall down|last=Walters|first=Walters|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|date=2000-10-02|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>  A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time.<ref name=ratings>{{cite news|title=A Surprise Winner at the Olympic Games in Beijing: NBC|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|last2=Sandomir|first2=Richard|work=The New York Times|publisher=NYTimes.com|date=2008-08-17|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/sports/olympics/18nbc.html?ref=business|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>  With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings.<ref>Slack (2004), pp. 16&ndash;18</ref>  The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program.  At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest.<ref name=slack17>Slack (2004), p. 17</ref>  The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.<ref name=slack17/>  Finally, the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during [[prime time]] in the United States.<ref>Cooper-Chen (2005), p. 230</ref>  The result of these efforts was mixed: the ratings for the 2006 Winter Games, held in Torino, Italy, were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, staged in Beijing.<ref name=ratings/><ref>Woods (2007), p. 146</ref>

===Controversy===
The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial.  The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialized sporting spectacle.<ref name=slack194/>  Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games.  The cities were awash in  corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares.<ref name=malloncii>Buchanon & Mallon (2006), p. cii</ref>  The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games.<ref name=malloncii/>  Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols.  The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.<ref name=slack194/>  Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments.<ref>Slack (2004), p. 194&ndash;195</ref>

== Symbols ==
{{Main|Olympic symbols}}
[[File:Olympic-flag-Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Olympic flag]]]]

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the [[Olympic rings]], consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (America, Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe). The colored version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the [[Olympic flag]]. These colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.<ref name=olympicsymbols>{{cite web |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1303.pdf |title= The Olympic Symbols |publisher= International Olympic Committee |format= PDF |accessdate= 2009-02-04}}</ref>

The [[Olympic motto]] is ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'', a [[Latin]] expression meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger". Coubertin's ideals are further expressed in the [[Olympic creed]]:

{{blockquote|The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.<ref name=olympicsymbols/>}}

Months before each Games, the [[Olympic flame]] is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a [[parabolic mirror]] which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony.<ref name=torch>{{cite web |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_655.pdf |title= The Olympic flame and the torch relay |work= Olympic Museum |publisher= International Olympic Committee |year= 2007 |page= 6 |format= PDF |accessdate= 2009-02-04}}</ref>  Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the torch relay was introduced at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Games]], as part of the German government's attempt to promote its [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] ideology.<ref name=olympicsymbols/>

The [[Olympic mascot]], an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part on the Games identity promotion since the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], when the Russian bear cub [[Misha]] reached international stardom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsflavor.com/world/10-olympic-mascots-how-many-can-you-remember/|title=10 Olympic Mascots: How Many Can You Remember?|last=Evans|first=R.

== Ceremonies ==
{{Main|Olympic Games ceremony}}
=== Opening ===
[[File:Opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympics.jpg|thumb|A scene from the opening ceremony of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]]]]

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.<ref name=OCFactSheetS>{{cite web |title= Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games |publisher= International Olympic Committee |month= February |year= 2008 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1134.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2008-08-14}}</ref><ref name=OCFactSheetW>{{cite web |title= Fact sheet: Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games |publisher= International Olympic Committee |month= February |year= 2008 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1036.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.<ref name=OCprotocol1>{{cite book |title= The Modern Olympic Games |chapter= The development of the Games - Between festival and tradition |publisher= International Olympic Committee |pages= 5 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf |chapterurl= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf#pages=5 |format= PDF |accessdate= 2008-08-29}}</ref>  The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture.<ref name=OCprotocol1/> The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100&nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |title= Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 2008-08-08  |accessdate= 2008-09-09}}</ref>

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics.  Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter.  During the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which was hosted in [[Athens, Greece]], the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier—often a well-known and successful Olympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/>

=== Closing ===
[[File:Birdsclosing.jpg|thumb|Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]]]

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.
Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece, to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games; the flag of the current host country, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web |title= Olympic Closing Ceremony Protocol |publisher= New Dehli Television |url= http://www.ndtv.com/olympics/storypage.aspx?storyid=SPOEN20080062750 |date= 2008-08-30 |accessdate= 2008-09-10}}</ref> 
The president of the organizing committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.<ref>{{cite web |title= Closing Ceremony |publisher= International Olympic Committee |date= 2002-01-31 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2008-08-27}}</ref>  
In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/38344/32574/w6rlej/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem.html |title=The Olympic Flags and Emblem |publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|10}}}}</ref> 
After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.

=== Medal presentation ===
[[Image:CyclingTeamPursuitBeijing2008.jpg|thumb|A medal ceremony during the 2008 Summer Olympics]]

A medal ceremony is held after each Olympic event is concluded.

For the men's marathon, the competition is usually held early in the morning on the last day of Olympic competition and its medal ceremony is then held in the evening during the closing ceremony.

== Sports ==
{{Main|Olympic sports}}

The [[Olympic sports|Olympic Games program]] consists of 26 sports, 30 disciplines and nearly 300 events.  For example, [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]].  It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wrestling|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>  The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports.<ref name="Sports">{{cite web |url=http://olympic.org/uk/sports/index_uk.asp |title=Sports |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|8}}}}</ref>  [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|fencing]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|artistic gymnastics]] are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program. [[Cross country skiing at the Winter Olympics|Cross-country skiing]], [[Figure skating at the Winter Olympics|figure skating]], [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|ice hockey]], [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]], [[Ski jumping at the Winter Olympics|ski jumping]], and [[Speed skating at the Winter Olympics|speed skating]] have been featured at every Winter Olympics program since its inception in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Current Olympic sports, like [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|badminton]], [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|basketball]], and [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|volleyball]], first appeared on the program as [[demonstration sport]]s, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp |title=Olympic Sports of the Past |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|10}}}}</ref>

Olympic sports are governed by [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.<ref name="sports">Olympic Charter (2007), pp. 88–90.</ref>  There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program.  These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/index_uk.asp |title=International Sports Federations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref><ref>Olympic Charter (2007), p. 87</ref> During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |title=Factsheet: The sessions |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|8}}}}</ref>  There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity, including chess and surfing.<ref name=recognizedsports>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/recognized/index_uk.asp |title=Recognised Sports |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref>

In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non-Olympic recognized sports.  The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games.<ref name=factsheetsports>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1135.pdf |title=Factsheet: The sports on the Olympic programme |publisher=International Olympic Committee |year=2008 |month=February |format=PDF |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|8}}}}</ref>  The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005.  Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the [[2016 Summer Olympic Games|2016]] and [[2020 Summer Olympic Games]].<ref name=newosports>{{cite web|title=Golf, rugby added for 2016 and 2020|work=The Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=09-10-09|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=4545111|accessdate=09-10-09}}</ref>

The 114th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Session]], in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  Three years later, at the [[117th IOC Session]], the first major program revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|softball]] from the official program of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Games]]. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 program will feature just 26 sports.<ref name=factsheetsports/>  The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.<ref name=newosports/>

=== Amateurism and professionalism ===
{{See|Amateurism}}
[[Image:Nagano 1998-Russia vs Czech Republic.jpg|right|thumb|Professional [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players were allowed to participate in [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]] starting in 1998 (''1998 Gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic pictured'').]]
The [[ethos]] of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|English Independent school]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.<ref name=OIdeology>{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120&ndash;123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}</ref>  The independent schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]'', a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing.  There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.<ref name=OIdeology/> Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.<ref name=OIdeology/>

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional [[baseball]] before the Olympics. His medals were restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|9}}}}</ref> Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1936 |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|9}}}}</ref>

As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.<ref name=OIdeology/> The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.<ref>{{cite paper |last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses — from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comité International Pierre De Coubertin |form=PDFlink |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2008|9|13}}}}</ref> Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs.<ref name="Amateurism">{{cite news |title=Amateurism |date=1999-07-12|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company, Inc.|url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr01.htm |accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>
As of 2004, the only sport in which no professionals compete is [[boxing]], although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees. In men's [[football (soccer)]], only three players over the age of 23 are eligible to participate per team in the Olympic tournament.<ref name="Amateurism"/>

The [[Olympic Council of Ireland]] boycotted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Games]], because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the [[Irish Free State]] rather than representing the entire [[Ireland|island of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Krüger|first=Arnd |coauthors=William J.

In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their [[racial segregation|segregationist]] regimes. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because [[New Zealand national rugby union team|its national rugby union team]] had toured [[apartheid]]-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport.<ref name="CBC boycott">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/09/f-olympics-history-1976.html |title=African nations boycott costly Montreal Games |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |date=2008-07-30|accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref> Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a Tanzania-led withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.<ref name="CBC boycott"/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore109/ore109h.pdf |title=Africa and the XXIst Olympiad |journal=Olympic Review |issue=109–110 |pages=584–585 |year=1976 |month=November–December |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|6}}}}</ref>
Taiwan also decided to boycott these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted pressure on the Montreal organizing committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name.

In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's Games. Sixty-five nations refused to compete at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics]] in 1980 because of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 81, the lowest number since 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1980 |title=Moscow 1980: Did you know? |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|7}}}}</ref> The Soviet Union and 14 of its [[Eastern Bloc]] partners (except [[Romania at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Romania]]) countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]] of 1984, contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes.

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]], and in response to [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan disturbances]] and ongoing [[War in Darfur|conflict in Darfur]].

=== Politics ===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G00630, Sommerolympiade, Siegerehrung Weitsprung.jpg|right|thumb|Jesse Owens on the podium after winning the long jump at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]]]
The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception.  Nazi Germany wished to portray the [[Nazi|Nationalist Socialist Party]] as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the [[1936 Summer Olympic Games|1936 Games]].<ref>Findling & Pelle (2004) p. 107</ref> The Games were also intended to show the superiority of the [[Aryan]] race; a goal that was not met due in part to the achievements of athletes such as [[Jesse Owens]], who won four gold medals at this Olympics and Indian hockey legend Major [[Dhyan Chand]], who captained the British Indian [[field hockey]] team to a great victory against Germany.<ref>Findling & Pelle (2004) p. 111&ndash;112</ref>  The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]]. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organized an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s.  During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, [[communist]] and [[socialist]] organizations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the "bourgeois" Olympics with the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|Workers Olympics]].<ref name=GSE>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Spartakiads |encyclopedia=Great Soviet Encyclopedia |volume=Vol. 24 (part 1)|page=286 |year=1976 |work=Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya |location=Moscow}}</ref><ref>Roche (2000), p. 106</ref>  It was not until the [[Soviet Union at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Games]] that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf |title=The USSR and Olympism |journal=[[Olympic Review]] |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |issue=84 |pages=530&ndash;557 |year=1974 |month=October |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>
 
Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda.  At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], in [[Mexico City]], two American [[track and field]] athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200&nbsp;meter sprint race, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second place finisher [[Peter Norman]] wore an [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]] badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.<ref name="Black Salute">{{cite news |title=1968: Black athletes make silent protest |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |accessdate={{dts|link=off|2009|2|7}} | date=1968-10-17}}</ref>

Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel.  An Iranian [[judoka]] did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].  Although he was officially disqualified for excessive weight, [[Arash Miresmaeli]] was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners.  He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iranian Judoka rewarded after snubbing Israeli |work=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |date=2004-09-08|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5942871/ |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

=== Use of performance enhancing drugs===
{{Main|Use of performance enhancing drugs at the Olympic Games}}
[[Image:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas J. Hicks]] running the [[marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]
In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, the winner of the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]], [[Thomas J. Hicks]], was given [[strychnine]] and [[brandy]] by his coach.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>  The only Olympic death linked to doping occurred at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Games of 1960]]. During the cycling road race, [[Denmark at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Danish]] cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines.<ref name=wadahistory>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Anti-Doping|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/About-WADA/History/A-Brief-History-of-Anti-Doping/|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|work=Newsweek|date=2008-01-07|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.<ref>Porterfield (2008), p. 15</ref> The most publicized doping-related disqualification was that of [[Canada at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Canadian]] sprinter [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]], who won the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics|100&nbsp;meter dash]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]] but tested positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was subsequently stripped and awarded to runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=2003-04-18|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, by forming the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and [[2002 Winter Olympics]].  Several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified because of doping offenses. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=2005-04-27|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances.  Several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games; only three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach|date=2008-08-19|publisher=Express India Newspapers|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name=wadahistory/>

=== Violence ===
The Olympics have not brought lasting peace to the world, even during celebrations of the Games.  In fact, three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled because of [[World War I]], and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of [[World War II]]. The [[2008 South Ossetia war|South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Vladimir Putin|Prime Minister Putin]] were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bush turns attention from politics to Olympics|work=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=2008-08-07|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26081584/|accessdate=2009=01=30}}</ref>  When [[Nino Salukvadze]] of Georgia won the bronze medal in the [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics|10&nbsp;meter air pistol]] competition, she stood on the medal podium with [[Natalia Paderina]], a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicized event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=2008-08-10 | date=2008-08-10}}</ref>

[[Terrorism]] has also threatened the Olympic Games. In 1972, when the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], eleven members of the [[Israel at the Olympics|Israel]]i Olympic team were taken hostage by the terrorist group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]].

== Champions and medalists ==
{{See|Lists of Olympic medalists|List of multiple Olympic gold medalists}}

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal must contain at least six grams of pure gold.<ref name="BeijingOlymp-1">{{cite web |title=Medals of Beijing Olympic Games Unveiled|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/67/83/article214028367.shtml|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals.

{{Main|List of Olympic Games host cities}}
The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven years ahead of their celebration.<ref name="bidpro" /> The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organization of the Olympic Games.<ref name="hostcity" /> In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee.<ref name="bidpro">{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|page= 72&ndash;75|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref> The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialized group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Excutive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.<ref name="hostcity">{{cite web|title=Choice of the host city|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/cities_uk.asp|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref> 

Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analyzed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games.<ref name="bidpro"/> After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which is assembled in a country that must not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.<ref name="bidpro"/>

By 2016, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92&nbsp;years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro will be the first for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have ever succeeded.

The United States has hosted four Summer and four Winter Olympics, more than any other nation. Among Summer Olympics host nations, the United Kingdom has been the host of two Games, and will host its third Olympics in 2012 in London. Germany, Australia, France, and Greece are the other nations to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. Among host cities, only Los Angeles, Paris, Athens and London have played host to the Olympic Games more than once- each holding that honor twice. With the 2012 Games scheduled to take place in London, the British capital will hold the distinction of hosting the modern Olympics Games three times, more than any other city.


Concerning the Winter Olympics, France has hosted three Games, while Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Japan, and Italy have hosted twice. The most recent Games were held in [[Vancouver]], Canada's second Winter Olympics and third overall. The next Winter Games will be in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]] in 2014, which will be the first time this nation has hosted.
