{{History of China|BC=1}}
The '''Three Kingdoms period''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|三|國|時|代}}|s={{linktext|三|国|时|代}}|p={{linktext|Sān|guó| shí|dài}}}}) is a period in the [[history of China]], part of an era of disunity called the ''[[Six Dynasties]]'' following immediately the loss of [[de facto]] power of the [[Han Dynasty]] emperors. In a strict academic sense it refers to the period between the foundation of the [[Cao Wei| Wei]] in 220 and the conquest of the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] by the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)| Jin Dynasty]] in 280.  However, many Chinese historians and laymen extend the starting point of this period back to the uprising of the [[Yellow Turbans]] in 184.

The three kingdoms were [[Cao Wei|Wei]] ([[wikt:魏|魏]]), [[Shu Han|Shu]] ([[wikt:蜀|蜀]]), and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] ([[wikt:吳|吳]]).  To help further distinguish these states from other historical Chinese states of the same name, historians add a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei (曹魏), Shu is also known as Shu Han (蜀漢), and Wu is also known as Dong Wu or Eastern Wu (東吳). The term ''Three Kingdoms'' itself is somewhat of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by kings, but by an [[emperor]] who claimed legitimate succession from the [[Han Dynasty]]. Although the translation ''Three Empires'' is more contextually accurate,<ref>Chinaknowledge, [http://www.chinaknowledge.org/History/Division/sanguo.html Chinese History - Three Kingdoms]</ref> the term ''Three Kingdoms'' has become standard among [[sinologist]]s.

The earlier, "unofficial" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of [[China]]. The middle part of the period, from 220 and 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states, Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu.  The later part of this period was marked by the collapse of the tripartite situation: first the destruction of Shu by Wei (263), then the overthrow of Wei by the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265), and the destruction of Wu by Jin (280).

Although relatively short, this historical period has been greatly romanticised in the [[Culture of China|cultures]] of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]]. It has been celebrated and popularised in operas, folk stories, novels and in more recent times, films, television series, and [[video game]]s.  The best known of these is undoubtedly the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a novel dealing with the period that draws heavily on history. The authoritative historical record of the era is [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Sanguo Zhi]]'', along with [[Pei Songzhi]]'s later annotations of the text.

The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in [[Chinese history]].  A population census during the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] reported a population of approximately 50 million, while a population census during the early Western Jin Dynasty (after Jin re-unified China) reported a population of approximately 16 million.<ref name = ANU>{{cite web|title=The Three Kingdoms and Western Jin: A history of China in the Third Century AD|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/asianstudies/decrespigny/3KWJin.html|last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe|publisher=Australian National University| month =November | year=2003|accessdate=2007-10-29}}</ref>
However, the Jin dynasty's census was far less complete than the Han census, so these figures are in question. 

Technology advanced significantly during this period. [[Zhuge Liang]] invented the [[wooden ox]], suggested to be an early form of the [[wheelbarrow]], and improved on the [[repeating crossbow]]. A brilliant [[mechanical engineer]] known as [[Ma Jun]], in Wei, is considered by many to be the equal of his predecessor [[Zhang Heng]]. He invented a [[hydraulic]]-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for [[Emperor Ming of Wei]] (Cao Rui), square-pallet [[chain pumps]] for irrigation of gardens in [[Luoyang]], and the ingenious design of the [[South Pointing Chariot]], a non-[[magnetic]] directional [[compass]] operated by [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.

The power of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] went in to [[depression]] steadily declined after the reign of [[Emperor He of Han]] from a variety of political and economic problems.  A series of Han emperors ascended the throne while still youths, and ''de facto'' Imperial power often rested with the young emperors' older relatives.  Because these relatives occasionally were loath to give up their influence, emperors would, upon reaching maturity, be forced to rely on political alliances with senior officials and [[eunuchs]] to achieve control of the government. Political posturing and infighting between Imperial relatives and government eunuchs was a constant problem in Chinese government at the time. During the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperors Huan]] and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Ling]], leading officials' dissatisfaction with the eunuchs' usurpations of power reached a peak, and many began to openly protest against them. The first and second protests met with failure, and the court eunuchs persuaded the Emperor to execute many of the protesting scholars.  Some local rulers seized the opportunity to exert [[despot]]ic control over their lands and citizens, since many feared to speak out in the oppressive political climate.  Emperors Huan' and Ling's reigns were recorded as particularly dark periods of [[Han Dynasty]] rule.  In addition to political oppression and mismanagement, China experienced a number of natural disasters during this period, and local rebellions sprung up throughout China.

In the second month of [[184|184 AD]], Zhang Jue, leader of the Dao of Supreme Harmony [[Daoism|Daoist]] movement, along with his two brothers Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, led the movement's followers in a rebellion against the government that was called the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Their movement quickly attracted followers and soon numbered several hundred thousands and received support from many parts of Han China. They had 36 bases throughout China, with large bases having 10,000 or more followers and minor bases having 6,000 to 7,000, similar to Han armies. Their motto was: "The Han Emperor's already dead, Lord Zhang Jue shall take his stead; the [[Sexagenary cycle|year-cycle]] is at its head, into fortune shall all be led!" ({{zh|c=蒼天已死，黃天當立，歲在甲子，天下大吉}})  <ref>''Book of Han'' - ''Record of Emperor Xiaoling'' and the ''Zi Zhi Tong Xian'' -''Guanghe Year 6'' record that Zhang Jue declared himself Yellow Emperor and took their movement's name from a headscarf worn by followers [yellow signifying the Yellow Emperor and Imperial authority].</ref>  [[Emperor Ling of Han]] dispatched Generals Huangfu Song, Lu Zhi, and Zhu Jun to lead the Han armies against the Yellow Turbans, and decreed that local governments had to supply soldiers to assist in their efforts. It is at this point that the great [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] begins its narrative.  The Yellow Turbans were ultimately defeated and its surviving followers dispersed throughout China, but due to the turbulent situation throughout the empire, many were able to survive as [[bandits]] in mountainous areas, thus continuing their ability to contribute to the turmoil of the era.

With the widespread increase in bandits across the Chinese nation, the Han army had no way to repel each and every raiding party. In [[188]], Emperor Ling accepted a memorial from [[Yizhou]] governor Liu Yan suggesting he grant direct administrative power over feudal provinces and direct command of regional military to local governors, as well promoting them in rank and filling such positions with members of the Liu family or court officials.  This move made [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]] (''zhou'') official administrative units, and although they had power to combat rebellions, the later intra-government chaos allowed these local governors to easily rule independently of the central government.  Soon after this move, Liu Yan severed all of his region's (modern [[Sichuan]]) ties to the Han court, and several other areas followed suit.

===Dong Zhuo in power===
That same year, Emperor Ling died, and another struggle began between the court eunuchs for control of the Imperial family .  Court eunuch [[Jian Shuo]] planned to kill General [[He Jin]], a relative of the royal family, and to replace the Crown Prince Liu Bian with his younger brother Liu Xie, the Prince of Chenliu (in modern [[Kaifeng]]), though his plan was unsuccessful. Liu Bian took the Han throne as [[Emperor Shao of Han]], and General He Jin plotted with warlord [[Yuan Shao]] to assassinate the [[Ten Attendants]], a clique of ten eunuchs led by [[Zhang Rang]] who controlled much of the imperial court.  He Jin also ordered [[Dong Zhuo]], the frontier general in [[Liangzhou]], and [[Ding Yuan]], Inspector of Bingzhou (the area now between [[Baoding]] and [[Taiyuan]]), to bring troops to the capital to reinforce his position of authority.  The eunuchs learned of General He's plot, and had him assassinated before Dong Zhuo ever reached the capital, [[Luoyang]].  When Yuan Shao's troops reached the capital they stormed the palace complex, killing the Ten Attendants and two thousand of those loyal to them.  Though this move effectively ended the century-long feud between the eunuchs and the Imperial family, it ushered in the era of warlords and martial law that became the Three Kingdoms Era.

This event prompted the invitation of Dong Zhuo to enter Luoyang from the northwest boundary of China. At the time China faced the powerful barbarians of [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribe to the northwest, and thus Dong Zhuo controlled a large army with elite training. When he brought the army to Luoyang, he was able to easily overpower the existing armies of both sides and took control of the imperial court, ushering in a period of civil war across China.

Dong Zhuo then manipulated the succession so that the future [[Emperor Xian of Han China|Emperor Xian]] could take the throne in lieu of his elder half-brother. Dong Zhuo, while ambitious, genuinely wished for a more capable emperor. On his way to Luoyang, he encountered a small band of soldiers protecting the two sons of Emperor Ling fleeing the war zone. In the encounter Dong Zhuo acted arrogantly and threateningly, causing the elder half-brother to be paralyzed with fear; the younger brother, the future Emperor Xian, responded calmly with authority and commanded Dong Zhuo to protect the royal family with his army to return to the Imperial Court.

While Dong Zhuo originally wanted to re-establish the authority of Han Empire and manage all the political conflict properly, his political capability proved to be much worse than his military leadership. His behaviour grew more and more violent and authoritarian, executing or sending into exile all that opposed him, and showed less and less respect to the Emperor. He ignored all royal etiquette and frequently carried open weapons into the imperial court. In 190 [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|a coalition led by Yuan Shao]] was formed between nearly all the provincial authorities in the eastern provinces of the empire against Dong Zhuo. The mounting pressure from repeated defeat on the southern frontline against the [[Sun Jian]] forces drove the Han Emperor and later Dong Zhuo himself west to [[Chang'an]] in May 191.

Dong Zhuo once again demonstrated his political shortcomings by forcing millions of residents of Luoyang to migrate to Chang'an. He then set fire to Luoyang, preventing occupation by his enemies and destroying the biggest city in China at that time. In addition, he ordered his army to slaughter a whole village of civilians. The soldiers beheaded the civilians and carried their heads into Chang'an to show off as war trophies, pretending to have had a great victory against his enemies. A year later Dong Zhuo was killed in a [[coup d'etat]] by [[Wang Yun]] and [[Lü Bu]].

=== Rise of Cao Cao ===
[[Image:HanForeigner3rdCentury.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of a foreign soldier, Three Kingdoms, 3rd century AD, [[China]].]]
In 191, there was some talk among the coalition of appointing [[Liu Yu (2nd century)|Liu Yu]], an imperial relative, as [[emperor]], and gradually its members began to fall out. Most of the warlords in the coalition, with a few exceptions, sought the increase of personal military power in the time of instability instead of seriously wishing to restore the Han Dynasty's authority. The Han empire was divided between a number of regional warlords. Yuan Shao occupied the northern area of [[Ye, China|Ye]] and extended his power, by taking over his superior [[Han Fu]] with trickery and intimidation, north of the [[Yellow River]] against [[Gongsun Zan]], who held the northern frontier. Cáo Cāo, directly to Yuan's south, was engaged in a struggle against [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Liu Biao]], who occupied respectively the Huai River basin and Middle [[Yangzi]] regions. Further south the young warlord [[Sun Ce]], taking over after the untimely death of [[Sun Jian]], was establishing his rule in the Lower Yangzi, albeit as a subordinate of Yuan Shu. In the west, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] held Yizhou province while [[Hanzhong]] and the northwest were controlled by a motley collection of smaller warlords such as [[Ma Teng]] of Xiliang, the original post of Dong Zhuo.

Dong Zhuo, confident in his success, was slain by his own adopted son, [[Lü Bu]] and his father-in-law Wang Yun. Lü Bu, in turn, was attacked by Dong Zhuo's supporters: [[Li Jue (Three Kingdoms)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]], [[Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Ji]] and [[Fan Chou]]. Wang Yun and his whole family were executed. Lu fled to [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]], a northern warlord, and remained with him for a time before briefly joining Yuan Shao, but it was clear that Lü Bu was far too independent to serve another.

In August 195, Emperor Xian fled the tyranny of Li Jue at Chang'an and made a year long hazardous journey east in search of supporters. By 196, when he was received by [[Cao Cao]], most of the smaller contenders for power had either been absorbed by larger ones or destroyed. This was an extremely important move for Cao Cao following the suggestion from his primary advisor, [[Xun Yu]], commenting that by supporting the authentic Emperor, Cao Cao would have the formal legal authority to control the other warlords and force them to comply in order to restore the Han dynasty.

[[Cao Cao]], whose zone of control was the precursor to the Kingdom of Wei, had raised an army in the winter of 189. In several strategic movements and battles, he controlled the Dui province and defeated several factions of the Yellow Turban rebels. This earned him the aid of other local militaries controlled by [[Zhang Miao]] and [[Chen Gong]], who joined his cause to create his first sizable army. He continued the effort and absorbed approximately 300,000 [[Yellow Turban Rebellion|Yellow Turbans]] into his army as well as a number of clan-based military groups from the eastern side of Qing province. In 196 he established an imperial court at [[Xuchang]] and developed military agricultural colonies (''[[tuntian]]'') to support his army. Although the system imposed a heavy tax on hired civilian farmers (40% to 60% of agricultural production), the farmers were more than pleased to be able to work with relative stability and professional military protection in a time of chaos. This was later said to be his second important policy for success.

In 194, Cao Cao went to war with [[Tao Qian (Three Kingdoms)|Tao Qian]] of [[Xuzhou]], whose officers had executed his whole family. Tao Qian received the support of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Gongsun Zan]], but even then it seemed as if Cao Cao's superior forces would overrun Xuzhou entirely. However, Cao Cao received word that [[Lü Bu]] had seized Yan province in Cao Cao's absence, and accordingly he retreated, putting a halt to hostilities with Tao Qian for the time being. Tao Qian died that same year, leaving his province to Liu Bei. A year later, in 195, Cao Cao managed to drive Lü Bu out of Yan. Lu Bu fled to Xuzhou and was received by Liu Bei, and an uneasy alliance began between the two.

In the south, [[Sun Ce]], then an independent general under the service of Yuan Shu, defeated the warlords of [[Yangzhou]], including [[Liu Yao]], [[Wang Lang]], and [[Yan Baihu]]. The speed with which Sun Ce accomplished his conquests led to his nickname, "Little Conqueror" (小霸王), a reference to the late [[Xiang Yu]]. In 197, Yuan Shu, who was at odds with Cao Cao, Yuan Shao, and Liu Bei, felt assured of victory with his subordinate's conquests, and thus declared himself emperor of the [[Cheng Dynasty]]. The move, however, was a strategic blunder, as it drew the ire of many warlords across the land, including Yuan Shu's own subordinate Sun Ce, who had advised Yuan Shu not to make such a move. Cao Cao issued orders to Sun Ce to attack Yuan Shu. Sun Ce complied, but first convinced Cao Cao to form a coalition against Yuan Shu, of which Liu Bei and Lü Bu were members. Attacked on all sides, Yuan Shu was defeated and fled into hiding.

Afterwards, Lü Bu betrayed Liu Bei and seized Xuzhou, forming an alliance with Yuan Shu's remnant forces. Liu Bei fled to Cao Cao, who accepted him. Soon, preparations were made for an attack on Lü Bu, and the combined forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei besieged Xia Pi. Lü Bu's officers deserted him, Yuan Shu's forces never arrived as reinforcements, and he was bound by his own officers [[Song Xian]] and [[Wei Xu]] and executed along with many of his officers. Thus, the man known as the mightiest warrior in the land was no more.

In 200, [[Dong Cheng]], an officer of the Imperial Court, received a secret edict from the Emperor to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his co-conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to the Yuan Shao in the north.

After settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow river.

In 200, after winning a decisive battle against Liu Biao at Shaxian and putting down the rebellions of Xu Gong and others, Sun Ce was struck by an arrow and fatally wounded. On his deathbed, he named his younger brother, [[Sun Quan]], as his heir.

Following months of planning, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao met in force at [[Battle of Guandu|Guandu]]. Overcoming Yuan's superior numbers, Cao Cao decisively defeated him by setting fire to his supplies, and in doing so crippled the northern army. Liu Bei fled to Liu Biao of Jing province, and many of Yuan Shao's forces were destroyed. In 202, Cao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death and the resulting division among his sons to advance north of the Yellow River. He captured [[Ye, China|Ye]] in 204 and occupied the provinces of Ji, Bing, Qing and You. By the end of 207, after [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain|a lightning campaign]] against the [[Wuhuan]] barbarians, [[Cao Cao]] had achieved undisputed dominance of the [[North China Plain]].

=== Battle of Red Cliffs ===
{{main|Battle of Red Cliffs}}
[[Image:Chibi.jpg|thumb|300px|One traditional site of Red Cliffs ({{zh|c=赤壁}}), whose actual location is a matter of intense debate.]]
In 208, [[Cao Cao]] marched south with his army hoping to quickly unify the empire. [[Liu Biao]]'s son [[Liu Cong]] surrendered the province of Jing and Cao was able to capture a sizable fleet at Jiangling. [[Sun Quan]], the successor to [[Sun Ce]] in the Lower Yangzi, continued to resist, however. His advisor [[Lu Su]] secured an alliance with Liu Bei, himself a recent refugee from the north, and Sun Ce's sworn brother [[Zhou Yu]] was placed in command of Sun Quan's navy, along with a veteran officer of the Sun family, [[Cheng Pu]]. Their combined armies of 50,000 met Cao Cao's fleet and 200,000-strong force at [[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]] (Chinese: 赤壁 [[Chi Bi]]) that winter. After an initial skirmish, an attack beginning with a plan to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet was set in motion to lead to the decisive defeat of Cao Cao, forcing him to retreat in disarray back to the north. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], and provided the basis for the states of Shu and Wu.

After his return to the north, [[Cao Cao]] contented himself with absorbing the northwestern regions in 211 and consolidating his power. He progressively increased his titles and power, eventually becoming the Prince of Wei in 217, a title bestowed upon him by the puppet Han emperor that he controlled. [[Liu Bei]], having defeated the weak Jing warlords [[Han Xuan]], [[Jin Xuan]], [[Zhao Fan]], and [[Liu Du]], entered Yi province and later in 214 displaced Liu Zhang as ruler, leaving his commander [[Guan Yu]] in charge of Jing province. [[Sun Quan]], who had in the intervening years being engaged with defenses against Cao Cao in the southeast at [[Hefei]], now turned his attention to Jing province and the Middle Yangzi. Tensions between the allies were increasingly visible. In 219, after Liu Bei successfully seized Hanzhong from [[Cao Cao]] and as [[Guan Yu]] was engaged in the [[Battle of Fancheng|siege of Fan]], Sun Quan's commander-in-chief [[Lu Meng]] secretly seized Jing province, and his forces captured and slew Guan Yu.

=== Three Emperors ===
In the first month of 220, [[Cao Cao]] died and in the tenth month his son [[Cao Pi]] forced Emperor Xian to abdicate, thus ending the Han Dynasty. He named his state [[Kingdom of Wei|Wei]] and made himself emperor at Luoyang. In 221, Liu Bei named himself Emperor of Han, in a bid to restore the fallen Han dynasty. (His state is known to history as "Shu" or "Shu Han".) In the same year, Wei bestowed on [[Sun Quan]] the title of King of Wu. A year later, Shu Han troops declared war on Wu and met the Wu armies at the [[Battle of Yiling]]. At Yiling, Liu Bei was disastrously defeated by Sun Quan's commander [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] and forced to retreat back to Shu, where he died soon afterward. After the death of Liu Bei, Shu and Wu resumed friendly relations at the expense of Wei, thus stabilizing the tripartite configuration. In 222, Sun Quan renounced his recognition of [[Cao Pi]]'s regime and, in 229, he declared himself emperor at Wuchang.

Dominion of the north completely belonged to Wei, whilst Shu occupied the southwest and Wu the central south and east. The external borders of the states were generally limited to the extent of Chinese civilization. For example, the political control of Shu on its southern frontier was limited by the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] tribes of modern [[Yunnan]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]], known collectively as the [[Nanman|Southern Barbarians]] (南蠻).

=== Consolidation ===
{{See also|Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign}}
In 223 [[Liu Shan]] rose to the throne of Shu following his father's defeat and death. The defeat of Liu Bei at Yiling ended the period of hostility between Wu and Shu and both used the opportunity to concentrate on internal problems and the external enemy of Wei. For Sun Quan, the victory terminated his fears of Shu expansion into Jing province and he turned to the aborigines of the southeast, whom the Chinese collectively called the "Shanyue" peoples (see [[Yue (peoples)|Yue]]). A collection of successes against the rebellious tribesmen culminated in the victory of 224. In that year [[Zhuge Ke]] ended a three year siege of Danyang with the surrender of 100,000 Shanyue. Of these, 40,000 were drafted as auxiliaries into the Wu army. Meanwhile Shu was also experiencing troubles with the indigenous tribes of their south. The Southwestern [[Nanman]] peoples rose in revolt against Han authority, captured and looted the city of Yizhou. Zhuge Liang, recognising the importance of stability in the south, ordered the advance of the Shu armies in three columns against the Nanman. He fought a number of engagements against the chieftain [[Meng Huo]], at the end of which Meng submitted. A tribesman was allowed to reside at the Shu capital [[Chengdu]] as an official and the Nanman formed their own battalions within the Shu army.

=== Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions ===
{{Main|Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions}}
At the end of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s southern campaign, the Wu-Shu alliance came to fruition and Shu was free to move against the north. In 227 [[Zhuge Liang]] transferred his main Shu armies to [[Hanzhong]], and opened up the battle for the northwest with Wei. The next year, he ordered the general [[Zhao Yun]] to attack from Ji Gorge as a diversion while Zhuge himself led the main force to Qishan. The vanguard [[Ma Su]], however, suffered a tactical defeat at [[Battle of Jieting|Jieting]] and the Shu army was forced to withdraw. In the next six years [[Zhuge Liang]] attempted several more offensives, but supply problems limited the capacity for success. In 234 he led his last great northern offensive, reaching the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] south of the [[Wei River]]. Due to the death of Zhuge Liang (234 AD), however, the Shu army was forced once again to withdraw, but were pursued by Wei. The Shu forces began to withdraw; Sima Yi deduced Zhuge's demise and ordered an attack. Shu struck back almost immediately, causing Sima Yi to second guess and allow Shu to withdraw successfully.

=== Wu and the South ===
In the times of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s great northern offensives, the state of Wu had always been on the defensive against invasions from the north. The area around [[Hefei]] was the scene of many bitter battles and under constant pressure from Wei after the Battle of Red Cliffs. Warfare had grown so intense that many of the residents chose to migrate and resettle south of the [[Yangzi]]. After [[Zhuge Liang]]'s death, attacks on the [[Huainan]] region intensified but nonetheless, Wei could not break through the line of the river defenses erected by Wu, which included the Ruxu fortress.

[[Sun Quan]]'s long reign is regarded as a time of plenty for his southern state. Migrations from the north and the settlement of the Shanyue increased manpower for agriculture, especially along the lower reaches of the Yangzi and in Kuaiji commandery. River transport blossomed, with the construction of the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Trade with Shu flourished, with a huge influx of Shu cotton and the development of [[celadon]] and metal industries. Ocean transport was improved to such an extent that sea journeys were made to [[Manchuria]] and the island of [[Taiwan]]. In the south, Wu merchants reached Linyi (northern [[Vietnam]]) and Fu'nan (southern [[Vietnam]]). As the economy prospered, so too did the arts and culture. In the Yangzi delta, the first [[Buddhist]] influences reached the south from Luoyang. (See [[Buddhism in China]])

==Decline and End of the Three Kingdoms==
[[Image:China 5.jpg|250px|thumb|The Three Kingdoms in 262, on the eve of the conquest of Shu.]]
From the late 230s tensions began to become visible between the imperial Cao clan and the Sima clan. Following the death of [[Cao Zhen]], factionalism was evident between [[Cao Shuang]] and the Grand Commander [[Sima Yi]]. In deliberations, Cao Shuang placed his own supporters in important posts and excluded Sima, whom he regarded as a threat. The power of the Sima clan, one of the great landowning families of the Han, was bolstered by Sima Yi's military victories. Additionally, [[Sima Yi]] was an extremely capable strategist and politician. In 238 he [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|crushed the rebellion]] of [[Gongsun Yuan]] and brought the Liaodong region directly under central control. Ultimately, he outmaneuvered [[Cao Shuang]] in power play. Taking advantage of an excursion by the imperial clansmen to the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|Gaoping tombs]], Sima undertook a [[putsch]] in Luoyang, forcing Cao Shuang's faction from authority. Many protested against the overwhelming power of the Sima family; notable among these were the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]]. One of the sages, [[Xi Kang]], was executed as part of the purges after Cao Shuang's downfall.

===Fall of Shu===
{{Main|Conquest of Shu by Wei}}
The decreasing strength of the Cao clan was mirrored by the decline of Shu. After [[Zhuge Liang]]'s death, his position as [[Chancellor_of_China#History|Lieutenant Chancellor]] fell to [[Jiang Wan]], [[Fei Yi]] and [[Dong Yun]], in that order. But after 258, Shu politics became increasingly controlled by the [[eunuch]] faction and corruption rose. Despite the energetic efforts of [[Jiang Wei]], Zhuge's [[protege]], Shu was unable to secure any decisive achievement. In 263, Wei launched a three-pronged attack and the Shu army was forced into general retreat from Hanzhong. Jiang Wei hurriedly held a position at [[Jian'ge]] but he was outflanked by the Wei commander [[Deng Ai]], who force-marched his army from Yinping through territory formerly considered impassable. By the winter of the year, the capital Chengdu fell due to the strategic invasion of Wei by Deng Ai who invaded Chengdu personally. The emperor [[Liu Shan]] thus surrendered. The state of Shu had come to an end after forty-three years.

===Fall of Wei===
[[Cao Huan]] succeeded to the throne in 260 after [[Cao Mao]] was killed by [[Sima Zhao]]. Soon after, Sima Zhao died and his title as Lord of Jin was inherited by his son [[Sima Yan]]. Sima Yan immediately began plotting to become Emperor but faced stiff opposition. However, due to advice from his advisors, Cao Huan decided the best course of action would be to abdicate, unlike his predecessor Cao Mao. Sima Yan seized the throne in 264 after forcing Cao Huan's abdication, effectively overthrowing the Wei Dynasty and establishing the successor [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]]. This situation was similar to the deposal of [[Han Xiandi|Emperor Xian]] of the Han Dynasty by [[Cao Pi]], the founder of the Wei Dynasty.

===Fall of Wu===
{{Main|Conquest of Wu by Jin}}
Following Sun Quan's death and the ascension of the young [[Sun Liang]] as emperor in 252, the kingdom of Wu went into a period of steady decline. Successful Wei suppression of rebellions in the [[Huainan]] region by [[Sima Zhao]] and [[Sima Shi]] reduced any opportunity of Wu influence. The fall of Shu signalled a change in Wei politics. After Liu Shan surrendered to Wei, [[Sima Yan]] (grandson of Sima Yi), overthrew the Wei emperor and proclaimed his own dynasty of Jin in 264, ending forty-six years of Cao dominion in the north. After Jin's rise, Emperor [[Sun Xiu]] of Wu died, and his ministers gave the throne to [[Sun Hao]]. Sun Hao was a promising young man, but upon ascension he became a tyrant, killing or exiling all who dared oppose him in the court. In 269 Yang Hu, Jin commander in the south, started preparing for the invasion of Wu by ordering the construction of a fleet and the training of marines in Sichuan under Wang Jun. Four years later, [[Lu Kang]], the last great general of Wu, died leaving no competent successor. The planned Jin offensive finally came in the winter of 279. Sima Yan launched five simultaneous offensives along the Yangzi River from Jianye to Jiangling whilst the [[Sichuan]] fleet sailed downriver to Jing province. Under the strain of such an enormous attack, the Wu forces collapsed and [[Jianye]] fell in the third month of 280. Emperor Sun Hao surrendered and was given a [[fiefdom]] on which to live out his days. This marked the end of the Three Kingdoms era, and the beginning of a break in the forthcoming 300 years of chaos.

== Population ==
The ''[[Sanguo Zhi]]'' contains population figures for the three kingdoms. As with many Chinese historical population figures, these numbers are likely to be less than the actual populations, since census and tax records went hand in hand, and tax evaders were often not on records.

While it is clear that warfare undoubtedly took many lives during this period, the census figures do not support the idea that millions were wiped out solely from warfare. Other factors such as mass migration out of China must be taken into account.

== Economy ==
In economic terms the division of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even in the [[Northern Song]], seven hundred years after the Three Kingdoms, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and [[Sichuan]]). These geographical divisions are underscored by the fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] linking north and south, the hauling-way through the [[Three Gorges]] of the Yangzi linking southern China with Sichuan and the [[gallery road]]s joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of [[Zhuge Liang]] (see [[Longzhong Plan]]).

==The Three Kingdoms in popular culture==
{{See|Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Cultural_references}}
Numerous people and affairs from the period later became Chinese [[legend]]s.  The most complete and influential example is the [[historical fiction]] ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', written by [[Luo Guanzhong]] during the [[Ming dynasty]].  Fictional accounts of the Three Kingdoms, mostly based on the ''Romance'', play a significant role in East Asian [[popular culture]]. Books, TV serials, movies, cartoons/[[anime]], games, and music on the topic are still regularly produced in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.
