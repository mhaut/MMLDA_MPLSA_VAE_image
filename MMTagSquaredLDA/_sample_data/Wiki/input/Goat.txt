The '''domestic goat''' (''Capra aegagrus hircus'') is a subspecies of goat [[domesticated]] from the [[wild goat]] of [[southwest Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. The goat is a member of the [[Bovidae]] family and is closely related to the [[sheep]] as both are in the [[goat-antelope]] subfamily [[Caprinae]]. There are over three hundred distinct breeds of goat.<ref name="hadog">Hirst, K. Kris. [http://archaeology.about.com/od/domestications/qt/goats.htm "The History of the Domestication of Goats".] ''[[About.com]]''. Accessed August 18, 2008.</ref>

Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species. Goats have been used for their [[milk]], [[Goat meat|meat]], hair, and skins over much of the world.<ref>Coffey, Linda, Margo Hale, and Ann Wells; [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/goatoverview.html "Goats: Sustainable Production Overview.]</ref> In the twentieth century they also gained in popularity as [[pet]]s.<ref>McLeod, Lianne; [http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/goats/a/goatsaspets.htm "Goats as Pets"] at About.com.</ref>

Female goats are referred to as ''does'' or ''nannies'', [[Entire (animal)|intact]] males as ''bucks'' or ''billies''; their [[offspring]] are ''kids''. Note that many goat breeders prefer the terms "buck" and "doe" to "billy" and "nanny". [[Castration|Castrated]] males are ''wethers''. [[Goat meat]] from younger animals is called ''kid'' or ''cabrito'', and from older animals is sometimes called ''chevon'', or in some areas “[[mutton]]”.

== Etymology ==
The [[Modern English]] word ''goat'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''gat'' which meant "she-goat", and this in turn derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*gaitaz'' (cf. [[Old Norse]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''geit'' "goat", [[German language|German]] ''Geiß'' "she-goat", and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''gaits'' "goat"), ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ghaidos'' meaning "young goat" but also "jump" (cf. [[Latin]] ''haedus'' "kid", [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''zajęcǐ'' "hare", [[Sanskrit]] ''jihīte'' "he jumps").<ref>Watkins, Calvert, ''et alii''; ''The American Heritage Dictionary'' (1975, edited by William Morris).</ref> To refer to the male of the species, Old English used ''bucca'' (which survives as "[[buck]]") until a shift to ''he-goat'' (and ''she-goat'') occurred in the late 12th century. "Nanny goat" originated in the 18th century and "billy goat" in the 19th.

== History ==
Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans.<ref name=OKstate>{{Cite document|title=Breeds of Livestock; Goats: (Capra hircus)|url=|http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/goats/|publisher=Oklahoma State University Board of Regents|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>  The most recent genetic analysis<ref>{{cite journal|author=Naderi et al.|date=November 18, 2008|title=The goat domestication process inferred from large-scale mitochondrial DNA analysis of wild and domestic individuals|journal=PNAS|volume=105|issue=46|pages=17659–17664|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804782105|pmid=19004765|last2=Rezaei|first2=HR|last3=Pompanon|first3=F|last4=Blum|first4=MG|last5=Negrini|first5=R|last6=Naghash|first6=HR|last7=Balkiz|first7=O|last8=Mashkour|first8=M|last9=Gaggiotti|first9=OE|pmc=2584717}}</ref> confirms the archaeological evidence that the [[Anatolia]]n [[Zagros]] are the likely origin of almost all domestic goats today. Another major genetic source of modern goats is the [[Bezoar goat]]; distributed from the mountainous regions of [[Asia Minor]] across the [[Middle East]] to [[Sind]].<ref name=OKstate/>

[[Neolithic]] farmers began to keep them for easy access to [[milk]] and meat, primarily, also for their dung, which was used as fuel and their bones, hair, and sinew for clothing, building, and tools.<ref name="hadog" />  The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in [[Ganj Dareh]] in [[Iranian Kurdistan]].  Goat remains have been found at archaeological     sites in [[Jericho]], [[Choga]],<!--unclear whether this is Chogha Zanbil or Chogha Mish; both have articles. needs add'l research/citation to clarify--> [[Mami]], [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Djeitun]] and [[Cayonu]]; dating the domestication of goats in western [[Asia]] at between 8000 and 9000 years ago.<ref name=OKstate/>  Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by [[goatherd]]s who were frequently children or [[adolescent]]s, similar to the more widely known [[shepherd]]. These methods of [[herding]] are still used today.

Historically, goat hide has been used for water and [[wine]] bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce [[parchment]].

== Anatomy ==
Most goats naturally have two [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. All goats have horns unless they are "polled" meaning they have one parent with a dominant polled gene.<ref>[http://www.americangoatsociety.com/education/polled_genetics.php American Goat Society:Polled Genetics], americangoatsociety.com.</ref>  There have been incidents of [[polycerate]] goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by [[keratin]] and other  [[proteins]], and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=nWCLpQFrdnMC&pg=PA519&dq=dehorning&sig=TtbBS_OKTdUAxfPQnjqo-uttlPk Goat Medicine: Horns], books.google.com</ref>

Goats are [[ruminants]]. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the [[rumen]], the [[reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]], the [[omasum]], and the [[abomasum]].

Goats have horizontal slit-shaped [[pupils]], an adaptation which increases [[peripheral vision|peripheral]] [[depth perception]].<ref>"Experiments On The Function Of Slit-Form Pupils", Toronto Univ. ''Studies in Psychology'' v. '''2'''</ref>  Because goats' [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] are usually pale, the pupils are much more visible than in animals with horizontal pupils, but very dark irises, such as cattle, deer, most horses and many sheep.

Both male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross [[boer goat|boers]], and [[pygmy goat]]s) may have [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]], one dangling from each side of the neck.<ref>[http://www.tripleigoats.com/faq.htm Frequently Asked Questions - Triple I Goats], tripleigoats.com</ref>

Some breeds of sheep and goats look similar, but they can usually be told apart because goat tails are short and point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger – though some (like those of [[Northern European short-tailed sheep]]) are short, and longer ones are often [[Docking (animal)|docked]].

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Domestic goat kid in capeweed.jpg|thumb|A 2 month old goat kid in a field of [[Arctotheca calendula|capeweed]].]]
In some climates, goats are able to [[mating|breed]] at any time of the year. In temperate climates and among the Swiss breeds, the breeding season commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring. Does of any breed come into [[Estrous cycle|heat]] every 21 days for 2 to 48 hours. A doe in heat typically flags her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat.

Bucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] in the fall as with the doe's heat cycles. Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does.

In addition to natural mating, [[artificial insemination]] has gained popularity among goat [[breeder]]s, as it allows easy access to a wide variety of [[bloodline]]s.
[[File:Suckling goat.jpg|thumb|left|200x|Suckling]]
[[Gestation]] length is approximately 150 days. [[Twins]] are the usual result, with single and [[multiple birth|triplet]] births also common. Less frequent are litters of [[quadruplet]], [[quintuplet]], and even [[sextuplet]] kids. Birthing, known as ''kidding'', generally occurs uneventfully. Right before kidding the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip. Also she will have heavy breathing, a worried look, become restless and show great display of affection for her keeper. The mother often [[placentophagy|eats the placenta]], which gives her much needed nutrients, helps stanch her bleeding, and parallels the behavior of wild [[herbivores]] such as deer to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predators.<ref>{{cite video

''Freshening'' (coming into milk production) occurs at kidding. Milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between 660 to 1,800&nbsp;[[Litre|L]] (1,500 and 4,000&nbsp;lb) of milk per 305 day [[lactation]]. On average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least 6&nbsp;lb (2.7&nbsp;l) of milk per day while she is in milk.  A first time milker may produce less, or as much as 16&nbsp;lb (7.3&nbsp;l), or more of milk in exceptional cases.  After the 305 day lactation, the doe will "dry off", typically after she has been bred.  Occasionally, goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical 305 days.<ref>[http://www.dairygoatjournal.com/issues/84/84-6/Tim_King.html Dairygoatjournal.com]</ref>  Meat, fibre, and [[pet]] breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until [[weaning]].

[[Male lactation#Animals Male Lactation|Male lactation]] is also known to occur in goats.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kumar | first = Dr. Davendra | coauthors = S. Saha, O.H.

== Diet ==
Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, except tin cans and [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] boxes. While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are [[Browsing (predation)|browsing]] animals, not [[grazers]] like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their natural curiosity) will chew on and taste just about anything resembling plant matter in order to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard and paper labels from tin cans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsgra.com/PDF-files/secogoats.pdf |title=Learning About Goats |publisher=Texas Department of Agriculture }}</ref> Another possibility is that the goats are curious about the unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes.

[[File:Domestic goat feeding on capeweed.jpg|thumb|A domestic goat feeding in a field of capeweed, a weed which is toxic to most stock animals]]
Aside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant. However, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which are otherwise toxic.<ref>"War on Weeds," ''Rails to Trails Magazine,'' Spring 2004, p. 3</ref> They will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing [[starvation]]. This is one reason goat rearing is most often [[Free range|free ranging]], since stall-fed goat rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.

Goats prefer to browse on [[shrubbery]] and [[weed]]s, more like deer than sheep, preferring them to grasses. [[Nightshade]] is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats. [[Silage]] (corn stalks) is not good for goats, but haylage can be used if consumed immediately after opening. [[Alfalfa]] is their favorite hay; [[fescue]] is the least palatable and least nutritious.  [[Mold]] in a goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it.  Goats should not be fed grass showing any signs of mold.

The digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other [[ruminant]]s) is essentially the same as that of a [[monogastric]] animal. Milk digestion begins in the [[abomasum]], the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticular/esophageal groove during suckling. At birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Goats butting heads in Germany.jpg|thumb|Goats establish a [[dominance hierarchy]] in flocks, sometimes through head butting]]

Goats are extremely curious and intelligent. They are easily trained to pull carts and walk on leads. [[Ches McCartney]], nicknamed "the goat man", toured the [[United States]] for over three decades in a wagon pulled by a herd of pet goats. They are also known for escaping their pens. Goats will test fences, either intentionally or simply because they are handy to climb on. If any of the fencing can be spread, pushed over or down, or otherwise be overcome, the goats will escape. Being very intelligent, once a weakness in the fence has been discovered, it will be exploited repeatedly. Goats are very coordinated and can climb and hold their balance in the most precarious places. Goats are also widely known for their ability to climb trees, although the tree generally has to be on somewhat of an angle. The vocalization goats make is called bleating.

Goats have an intensely inquisitive and intelligent nature: they will explore anything new or unfamiliar in their surroundings. They do so primarily with their [[prehensile]] upper lip and tongue. This is why they investigate items such as buttons, camera cases or clothing (and many other things besides) by nibbling at them, occasionally even eating them.

== Life expectancy ==

Life expectancy for goats is between 15<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-life-expectancy-of-pets.htm|title=What is the Life Expectancy of Pets?|accessdate=30 May 2009}}</ref> and 18 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Biological Data|editor=William S. Spector|publisher=Saunders|year=1956}}</ref> An instance of a goat reaching the age of 24 has been reported.<ref name=fiascofarm>{{cite web|url=http://fiascofarm.com/goats/age.htm|title=Teeth, Life Expectancy & How to estimate a goat's age|date=16 Match 2009|accessdate=30 May 2009|publisher=fiascofarm.com}}</ref>

Several factors can reduce this average expectancy, however; problems during kidding can lower a doe's expected life span to 10 or 11, and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck's expected life span to 8 or 10.<ref name=fiascofarm/>

== Goats in agriculture ==
[[File:Cabrasnortechico.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Goat [[husbandry]] is common through the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]] region in [[Chile]], but also produces severe erosion and [[desertification]]. Image from upper [[Limarí River]]]]
A goat is useful to humans either living or dead, first as a renewable provider of milk and fiber, and then as meat and hide. Some [[charitable organization|charities]] provide goats to [[poverty|impoverished]] people in poor countries, because goats are easier and cheaper to manage than [[cattle]], and have multiple uses. In addition, goats are used for driving and [[pack goat|packing]] purposes.

For instance, the intestine is used to make "[[catgut]]", which is still in use as a material for internal human [[surgical suture]]s and strings for [[String instrument|musical instruments]]. The horn of the goat, which signifies wellbeing ([[Cornucopia]]), is also used to make [[spoon]]s.<ref>anonymous; [http://www.mnh.si.edu/lookingbothways/data/objects/36.html Goat-Horn Spoon].</ref>
[[File:Boerbok.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Boer goat]] - in this case a buck - is a widely-kept meat breed.]]

=== Meat ===
{{Main|Goat meat}}
The taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of [[lamb and mutton|spring lamb]] meat;<ref name=LifeMag1945>{{Cite book|title=Milk Goats|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dUgEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA57&dq=goat%20tastes%20like%20lamb&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=goat%20tastes%20like%20lamb |date=Jun 18, 1945|publisher=Life |accessdate=2010-07-06|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> in fact, in the English-speaking islands of the [[Caribbean]], and in some parts of Asia, particularly [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], the word “[[mutton]]” is used to describe both goat and lamb meat. However, some compare the taste of goat meat to [[veal]] or [[venison]], depending on the age and condition of the goat.  Its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of [[4-methyloctanoic acid|4-methyloctanoic]] and [[4-methylnonanoic acid]].<ref>Cramer, D.A. (1983) ''Chemical compounds implicated in lamb flavor''. Food Technonogy. flavor.. 37:249-257 and Wong, E., Nixon, L.N. and Johnson, B.C. (1975) ''The contribution of 4-methyloctanoic (hircinoic) acid to mutton and goat meat flavor''. New Zealand j. Agr. Res. 18:261-266. Both cited in K. Intarapichet K., Sihaboot W. and Chungsiriwat P. (date?) ''Chemical and Sensory Characteristics of Emulsion Goat Meat Sausages Containing Pork Fat or Shortening'' available as a PDF from- [http://www.thaiscience.info/Article%20for%20ThaiScience/Article/1/Ts-1%20chemical%20&%20sensory%20characteristics%20of%20emulsion%20goat%20meat%20sausages%20containing%20pork%20fat%20or%20shortening.pdf]</ref> It can be prepared in a variety of ways including [[stewed]], [[baked]], [[Grilling|grilled]], [[barbecue]]d, [[minced]], [[canning|canned]], [[fried]], [[curry|curried]], or made into [[sausage]]. Due to its low fat content, the meat can toughen at high temperatures without additional moisture. One of the most popular goats grown for meat is the [[South Africa]]n [[Boer goat|Boer]], introduced into the [[United States]] in the early 1990s.  The [[New Zealand]] [[Kiko goat|Kiko]] is also considered a meat breed, as is the [[Fainting goat|myotonic or "fainting goat"]], a breed originating in [[Tennessee]].

=== Milk, butter and cheese ===
[[File:Goat milking on an organic farm in Israel.jpg|thumb|A goat being milked on an [[organic farm]].]]
Goats produce approximately 2% of the world's total annual milk supply.<ref>FAO. 1997. 1996 Production Yearbook. Food Agr. Organ., UN. Rome, Italy.</ref> 
Some goats are bred specifically for [[milk]].  If the strong-smelling buck is not separated from the does, his scent will affect the milk.

Doe milk naturally has small, well-emulsified fat globules, which means the cream remains suspended in the milk, instead of rising to the top, as in raw cow milk; therefore, it does not need to be [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenized]]. Indeed, if the milk is going to be used to make cheese it is recommended that it is not homogenized as this changes the structure of the milk impacting the culture's ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheese.<ref>Amrein-Boyes, D. (2009). 200 Easy Homemade Cheese Recipes. Robert Rose Inc.: Toronto</ref>

Dairy goats in their prime, which is generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle, average 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6&nbsp;kg) of milk production daily (roughly 3 to 4 US quarts (2.7 to 3.6 liters)) during a ten-month [[lactation]], producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation.  The milk generally averages 3.5 percent [[butterfat]].  A doe may be expected to reach her heaviest production during her third or fourth lactation.<ref>[http://www.adga.org American Dairy Goat Association], adga.org</ref> 

Doe milk is commonly processed into [[cheese]], [[butter]], [[ice cream]], [[yoghurt]], [[cajeta]] and other products.  [[Goat's milk cheese|Goat cheese]] is known as ''chèvre'' in France, after the [[French language|French]] word for "goat". Some varieties include [[Rocamadour (cheese)|Rocamadour]] and Montrachet.<ref>[http://web.foodnetwork.com/food/web/encyclopedia/termdetail/0,7770,1237,00.html Chèvre cheese], foodnetwork.com</ref>  Goat [[butter]] is white because goats produce milk with the yellow [[beta-carotene]] converted to a colorless form of [[vitamin A]].

====Nutrition====
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] discourages feeding infants milk derived from goats.  An April 2010 case report <ref>{{cite web|title=Fresh Goat's Milk for Infants: Myths and Realities—A Review|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/125/4/e973|publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> summarizes their recommendation and presents "a comprehensive review of the consequences associated with this dangerous practice," also stating, "Many infants are exclusively fed unmodified goat's milk as a result of cultural beliefs as well as exposure to false online information. Anecdotal reports have described a host of morbidities associated with that practice, including severe electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylactic shock, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and infections."  Untreated caprine [[brucellosis]] results in a 2% case fatality rate.  According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), doe milk is not recommended for human infants because it contains "inadequate quantities of [[iron]], [[folate]], [[vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[vitamin D|D]], [[thiamin]], [[niacin]], [[vitamin B6]], and [[pantothenic acid]] to meet an infant’s nutritional needs" and may cause harm to an infant's [[kidneys]] and could cause metabolic damage.<ref name="USDA 1">{{cite web|title=Infant Formula Feeding|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Topics/FG/Chapter4_InfantFormulaFeeding.pdf|publisher=[[USDA]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref>  

The Department of Health in the United Kingdom has repeatedly released statements stating on various occasions that <ref>{{cite web|title=Fresh Goat's Milk for Infants: Myths and Realities—A Review|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1492334/Goats-milk-formula-not-suitable-for-infants-Government-warns.html|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> "Goats' milk is not suitable for babies, and infant formulas and follow-on formulas based on goats' milk protein have not been approved for use in Europe," and "infant milks based on goats' milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition for infants.".<ref name="Professor Martin Marshall - Deputy Chief Medical Officer - Department of Health">{{cite web |url=http://www.info.doh.gov.uk/doh/embroadcast.nsf/vwDiscussionAll/1BDFD19113CFC28C802571D20051E715 |title=Withdrawal From Sale of Infants Milks Based on Goats' Milk on 17 September 2006|accessdate=2007-08-12 |author= Professor Martin Marshall - Deputy Chief Medical Officer - Department of Health|date=22 August 2006|work=non-urgent memo |publisher= Department of Health}}</ref>

On the other hand, some farming groups promote the practice.  For example Small Farm Today in 2005 claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diets, proposing that [[glycerol ether]]s, possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants, are much higher in doe milk than in cow milk.<ref name=Smallfarm>{{cite journal |title=Small farm today|volume=22-24|publisher=Missouri Farm Pub.|year=2005|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ljNHAAAAYAAJ&q=LaMancha+goat&dq=LaMancha+goat|isbn=9781580171618}}</ref>  A 1970 book on animal breeding claimed that doe milk differs from cow or human milk by having higher digestibility, distinct [[alkalinity]], higher [[buffering capacity]], and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition.<ref>Devendra, C., and M. Burns. 1970. Goat production in the tropics. Commonwealth Bur. Anim. Breeding and Genetics,Tech. Commun. No. 19.</ref>  [[George Mateljan]] suggested that doe milk can replace [[sheep|ewe milk]] or cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to certain mammals' milk.<ref name="WHFoods">The World's Healthiest Foods. [http://www.whfoods.org/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=131 "Milk, goat"], whfoods.org</ref> However, like cow milk, doe milk has [[lactose]] (sugar), and may cause [[digestive disease|gastrointestinal problems]] for individuals with [[lactose intolerance]].<ref name="WHFoods"/>  In fact, the level of lactose is similar to that of bovine milk.<ref name="Professor Martin Marshall - Deputy Chief Medical Officer - Department of Health"/>

The Angora breed of goats produces long, curling, lustrous locks of [[mohair]]. The entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow and can be four inches or more in length.  Angora crossbreeds, such as the [[pygora]] and the [[Nigora goat|nigora]], have been created to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller, easier-to-manage animal.
The wool is [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] (cut from the body) twice a year, with an average yield of about 10 pounds.

Most goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer [[guard hairs]] on the surface.  The desirable fiber for the [[textile industry]] is the former, and it goes by several names (down, cashmere and pashmina).  The coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye. The [[cashmere goat]] produces a commercial quantity of [[cashmere wool]], which is one of the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced; cashmere is very fine and soft. The cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year, yielding around 9 [[ounces]] (200 [[grammes]]) of down.

In [[South Asia]], cashmere is called "[[pashmina]]" (from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''pashmina'', "fine wool").
In the 18th and early 19th century, Kashmir (then called Cashmere by the English), had a thriving industry producing shawls from goat down imported from Tibet and Tartary through Ladakh.  The shawls were introduced into Western Europe when the General in Chief of the French campaign in Egypt (1799–1802) sent one to Paris. Since these shawls were produced in the upper [[Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]] region, the wool came to be known as "cashmere".

== Goat breeds ==
{{Main|List of goat breeds}}
Goat breeds fall into overlapping, general categories. They are generally distributed in to those used for dairy, fiber, meat, skins, and as companion animals. Some breeds are also particularly noted as [[pack goat]]s.

== Showing ==
[[File:NigerianDwarfDairyGoat.jpg|thumb| left|A [[Nigerian Dwarf]] milker in show clip. This doe is angular and dairy with a capacious and well supported mammary system.]]
Goat [[breeder]]s' clubs frequently hold [[show (animal)|shows]], where goats are judged on traits relating to [[conformation]], [[udder]] quality, evidence of high production, longevity, build and muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production and the fiber itself (fiber goats). People who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award-winning animals command a higher price. Registered goats, in general, are usually higher-priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. A registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder.
Children's clubs such as [[4-H]] also allow goats to be shown. Children's shows often include a showmanship class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are scored. In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged.

Various "Dairy Goat Scorecards" (milking does) are systems used for judging shows in the US.   The [[American Dairy Goat Association]] (ADGA) scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major categories that include general appearance, the dairy character of a doe (physical traits that aid and increase milk production), body capacity, and specifically for the mammary system. Young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character.

'''The American Goat Society''' ('''AGS''') has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows. The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards. The "Angora Goat scorecard" used by the '''Colored Angora Goat Breeder's Association''' '''CAGBA''' (which covers the white and the colored goats) includes evaluation of an animal's fleece color, density, uniformity, fineness, and general body confirmation. Disqualifications include: a deformed mouth, broken down [[pastern]]s, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3&nbsp;inch split in scrotum, and close-set or distorted horns.

According to [[Norse mythology]], the god of thunder, [[Thor]], has a [[chariot]] that is pulled by the goats [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr]]. At night when he sets up camp, Thor eats the meat of the goats, but take care that all bones remain whole. Then he wraps the remains up, and in the morning, the goats always come back to life to pull the chariot. When a farmer's son who is invited to share the meal breaks one of the goats' leg bones to suck the marrow, the animal's leg remains broken in the morning, and the boy is forced to serve Thor as a servant to compensate for the damage.

Possibly related, the [[Yule Goat]] is one of the oldest [[Scandinavia]]n and Northern [[Europe]]an [[Yule]] and [[Christmas]] symbols and traditions. Yule Goat originally denoted the goat that was slaughtered around Yule, but it may also indicate a goat figure made out of straw. It is also used about the custom of going door-to-door singing carols and getting food and drinks in return, often fruit, cakes and sweets. "Going Yule Goat" is similar to the British custom [[wassailing]], both with [[heathen]] roots. The [[Gävle Goat]] is a giant version of the Yule Goat, erected every year in the Swedish city of [[Gävle]].

The Greek god, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], is said to have the upper body of a man and the horns and lower body of a goat. Pan was a very lustful god, nearly all of the myths involving him had to do with him chasing nymphs. He is also credited with creating the [[pan flute]].

The goat is one of the twelve-year cycle of animals which appear in the [[Chinese zodiac]] related to the [[Chinese calendar]]. Each animal is associated with certain personality traits; those born in a year of the goat are predicted to be shy, introverted, creative, and perfectionist. See [[Goat (zodiac)]].

Several mythological hybrid creatures are believed to consist of parts of the goat, including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]. The [[Capricornus|Capricorn]] sign in the Western [[zodiac]] is usually depicted as a goat with a [[fish]]'s tail. [[Faun]]s and [[satyr]]s are mythological creatures that are part goat and part human. The mineral [[bromine]] is named from the Greek word "brόmos," which means "stench of he-goats."

Goats are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]].  A goat is considered a "clean" animal by [[Kosher|Jewish dietary laws]] and was slaughtered for an honored guest. It was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices. Goat-hair curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:4). It's horns can be used instead of sheep's horn to make a [[shofar]].<ref name="Hearing Shofar: The Still Small Voice of the Ram's Horn">Use a closing tag</ref>  On [[Yom Kippur]], the festival of the Day of Atonement, two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them.  One was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness, symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community.  From this comes the word "[[scapegoat]]".  A leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] told a [[parable]] of [[The Sheep and the Goats]]. ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 25)

Popular [[Christianity in Europe|Christian]] folk tradition in [[Europe]] associated [[Satan]] with imagery of goats (see [[Pan (mythology)]]). A common [[superstition]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was that goats whispered lewd sentences in the ears of the [[saint]]s. The origin of this belief was probably the behavior of the buck in [[estrus cycle|rut]], the very epitome of lust. The common medieval depiction of [[devil|the Devil]] was that of a goat-like face with horns and small beard (a [[goatee]]). The [[Black Mass]], a probably-mythological "Satanic mass," was said to involve a black goat{{Who|date=December 2008}}, the form in which Satan supposedly manifested himself for worship.

The goat has had a lingering connection with [[Satanism]] and [[paganism|pagan]] [[religion]]s, even into modern times. The inverted [[pentagram]], a symbol used in Satanism, is said to be shaped like a goat's head. The "[[Baphomet]] of [[Mendes]]" refers to a satanic goat-like figure from 19th century [[occult]]ism.

== Feral goats ==
{{Main|Feral goat}}
[[File:Feral goat in Aruba.JPG|thumb|Feral goat in [[Aruba]]]]
Goats readily revert to the wild (become feral) if given the opportunity. The only domestic animal known to return to feral life as swiftly is the cat.<ref name=OKstate/>  Feral goats have established themselves in many areas: they occur in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Galapagos]] and in many other places.  When feral goats reach large populations in habitats which are not adapted to them, they may have serious effects, such as removing native [[scrubland|scrub]], [[tree]]s and other vegetation. Feral goats are common in Australia.<ref>it is believed that there are over 50,000 feral goats in the Australian Outback.[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/goat/pubs/goat.pdf "The feral goat (''Capra hircus'') - Invasive species fact sheet".], environment.gov.au</ref> However, in other circumstances they may become a natural component of the habitat.
