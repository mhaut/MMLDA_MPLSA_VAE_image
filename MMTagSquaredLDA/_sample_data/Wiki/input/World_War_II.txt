'''World War II''', or the '''Second World War'''<ref>"Second World War" is preferred by British authors, "World War II" by American authors; both versions are correct.</ref> (often abbreviated as '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), was a global [[War|military conflict]] lasting from 1939 to 1945, which involved [[Participants in World War II|most of the world's nations]], including all of the [[great power]]s: eventually forming two opposing military alliances, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel mobilised. In a state of "[[total war]]," the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by significant events involving the mass death of civilians, including the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|only use of nuclear weapons in warfare]], it was the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in [[History of the world|human history]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Illustrated History of World War Two: An Authoritative Account of the Deadliest Conflict in Human History with Analysis of Decisive Encounters and Landmark Engagements|first=Donald |last=Sommerville|publisher=Lorenz Books|year=2008|page=5|isbn=0754818985}}</ref> resulting in [[World War II casualties|50 million to over 70 million fatalities]].

The war is generally accepted to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the [[invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], and subsequent [[declaration of war|declarations of war]] on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and most of the countries of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Germany set out to establish a large empire in Europe. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or subdued much of continental Europe; amid [[German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement|Nazi-Soviet agreements]], the nominally neutral Soviet Union fully or partially occupied and annexed territories of its six European neighbours. Britain and the Commonwealth remained the only major force continuing the fight against the Axis in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and in extensive [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|naval warfare]]. In June 1941, the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, giving a start to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest land theatre of war in history]], which, from this moment on, was tying down the major part of the Axis military power. In December 1941, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], which had been [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with [[Republic of China|China]] since 1937,<ref>{{Cite book|first1=David P|last1=Barrett|last2= Shyu|title= China in the anti-Japanese War, 1937–1945: politics, culture and society.

The Axis advance was stopped in 1942 after the defeat of Japan in a series of [[Battle of Midway|naval battles]] and after defeats of European Axis troops in [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]] and, [[Decisive victory|decisively]], at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. In 1943, with a series of [[Battle of Kursk|German defeats]] in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion]] of [[Fascist Italy]], and American victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded France]], while the Soviet Union regained all territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies.

The war in Europe ended with the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops and subsequent [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. The Japanese Navy was [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|defeated by the United States]], and invasion of the [[Japanese Archipelago]] ("Home Islands") became imminent.

The war ended with the total victory of the Allies over Germany and Japan in 1945. World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts (such as [[World War III]]). The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the [[Cold War]], which would last for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers started to decline, while the [[decolonization of Asia]] and [[decolonisation of Africa|Africa]] began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post-World War II economic expansion|economic recovery]]. Political integration emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations.

The start of the war is generally held to be 1 September 1939, beginning with the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]]; Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later.

Others follow [[A. J. P. Taylor]], who held that there was a simultaneous Sino-Japanese War in East Asia, and a Second European War in Europe and her colonies. The two wars merged in 1941, becoming a single global conflict, at which point the war continued until 1945. This article uses the conventional dating.<ref>Among other starting dates sometimes used for World War II are the 1935 Italian invasion of Abyssinia; (Ben-Horin, Eliahu (1943).

The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It has been suggested that the war ended at the armistice of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945); in some European histories, it ended on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] (8 May 1945). The [[Treaty of San Francisco|Treaty of Peace with Japan]] was not signed until 1951.<ref>{{Cite book|first= Shiraishi|last= Masaya |title=Japanese relations with Vietnam, 1951–1987|publisher= SEAP Publications|year= 1990|isbn= 0877271224 |page=4}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

[[World War I]] radically altered the diplomatic and political situations in [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]], with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]], including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Germany]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]; and the 1917 [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power in [[Russia]]. Meanwhile, the success of the Allied Entente powers including the United Kingdom, France, the United States, [[Italy]], [[Serbia]], and [[Romania]], and the creation of new states from the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the [[Russian Empire]], resulted in fundamental changes to the map of Eastern Europe. In the [[aftermath of World War I|aftermath of the war]], major unrest in Europe rose, especially [[Irrendentism|irredentist]] and [[Revanchism|revanchist]] nationalism and [[class conflict]]. Irredentism and revanchism were strong in Germany because she was forced to accept significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas colonies]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, massive reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of Germany's armed forces.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Russian Civil War]] had led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]]. After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Joseph Stalin]] seized power in the USSR and repudiated the [[New Economic Policy]] favouring the Five Year Plans instead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Davies|2008|pp=134–140}}</ref>

In the interwar period, domestic civil conflict occurred in Germany involving nationalists and reactionaries versus communists and moderate democratic political parties. A similar scenario occurred in Italy. Although Italy as an Entente ally made some territorial gains, Italian nationalists were angered that the terms of the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] upon which Italy had agreed to wage war on the Central Powers, were not fulfilled with the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed political forces supporting class conflict or liberalism, and pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at forcefully forging Italy as a world power, and promising to create a "[[Italian colonial empire|New Roman Empire]]."<ref>{{Harvnb|Shaw|2000|p=35}}</ref> In Germany, the [[Nazi Party]] led by [[Adolf Hitler]] pursued establishing such a fascist government in Germany. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], Nazi support rose and, in 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, and in the aftermath of the [[Reichstag fire]], Hitler created a totalitarian single-party state led by the Nazis.<ref>{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|p=265}}</ref>

The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in [[China]] launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese communist]] allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Preston|1998|p=104}}</ref> In 1931, an [[Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], which had long sought influence in China<ref>{{harvnb|Myers|1987|p=458}}</ref> as the first step of its [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as justification to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invade Manchuria]] and established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].<ref name=Mukden>{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=28}}</ref> Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several minor conflicts, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until signing the [[Tanggu Truce]] in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Volunteer Armies of Northeast China|url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000186948 |first=Anthony|last=Coogan|journal=History Today|volume=43|date=July 1993|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote= Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender.

[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right)]]

[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, became the [[Hitler's rise to power|Chancellor of Germany in 1933]]. He abolished [[democracy]], espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brody|1999|p=4}}</ref> Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco–Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, speeding up his rearmament programme and introducing [[conscription]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}</ref>

Hoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]]. The Soviet Union, concerned due to [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe]], wrote a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the [[League of Nations]], which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}</ref> However, in June 1935, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schmitz |first=David F |title= The First Wise Man|publisher= Rowman & Littlefield|year= 2001|isbn= 0842026320|page=124}}</ref> In October, Italy invaded Ethiopia, with Germany the only major European nation supporting the invasion. Italy then revoked objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Austria]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kitson|2001|p=231}}</ref>

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno Treaties|Locarno]] treaties by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarizing]] the [[Rhineland]] in March 1936. He received little response from other European powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}}</ref> When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July, Hitler and Mussolini supported fascist Generalissimo [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Nationalist Spain|nationalist forces]] in his civil war against the Soviet-supported [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare,<ref>{{harvnb|Graham|2005|p=110}}</ref> and the nationalists won the war in early 1939. Mounting tensions led to several efforts to strengthen or consolidate power. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome-Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year. In China, after the [[Xi'an Incident]] the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire in order to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.<ref>{{harvnb|Busky|2002|p=10}}</ref>

==Pre-war events==
===Invasion of Ethiopia===
{{Main|Second Italo–Abyssinian War}}

The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war was fought between the [[armed forces]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia'') and the armed forces of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]). The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition, it exposed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League's own [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]].<ref name=Barker-159>{{Cite book|last=Barker|first=A.

===Spanish Civil War===
{{main|Spanish Civil War}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Guernica after the bombing.]]

Germany and Italy lent support to the [[Spanish State|Nationalist insurrection]] led by general [[Francisco Franco]] in Spain. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] which showed leftist tendencies. Both sides used this war as an opportunity to test improved weapons and tactics. The [[Bombing of Guernica]], a city of 5000 - 7000 inhabitants, was considered a horrifying attack at the time, with a propaganda figure of 1,654 people killed widely circulated in the west, leading to charges of "terror bombing".<ref name="Air 1998">{{cite web|last=Corum|first=James S.|title=Inflated by Air Common Perceptions of Civilian Casualties from Bombing|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA399072|work=Thesis|publisher=Air War College.

===Japanese invasion of China===
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|A Chinese machine gun nest in the [[Battle of Shanghai]], 1937.]]

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of [[Beiping]] after instigating the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], which culminated in the [[Japan]]ese campaign to invade all of [[Republic of China|China]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fairbank|first1=John King|last2=Feuerwerker|first2=Albert|last3=Twitchett|first3=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge history of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=0521243386|pages=547–551}}</ref> The Soviets quickly signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with China]] to lend [[materiel]] support, effectively ending China's prior [[Sino-German cooperation (1911–1941)|cooperation with Germany]]. [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but after three months of fighting, [[Shanghai]] fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanjing|capturing the capital Nanjing]] in December 1937 and committed the [[Nanking Massacre]].

In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [[1938 Yellow River flood|flooding the Yellow River]]; although this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at [[Wuhan]], the [[Battle of Wuhan|city was taken]] by October.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fairbank|first1=John King|last2=Feuerwerker|first2=Albert|last3=Twitchett|first3=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge history of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=0521243386|page=566}}</ref> Japanese military victories, however, did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve, instead the Chinese government relocated inland to [[Chongqing]] to continue their resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Jay|title=The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780674033382|pages=150–152}}</ref>

===Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union and Mongolia===
{{See also|Nanshin-ron|Soviet-Japanese Border Wars}}
[[File:Khalkhin Gol Soviet offensive 1939.jpg|thumb|Soviet troops fought the Japanese during the [[Battle of Khalkin Gol]] in Mongolia, 1939.]]
On 29 July 1938, the Japanese invaded the USSR and were checked at the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]]. Although the battle was a Soviet victory, the Japanese dismissed it as an inconclusive draw, and on 11 May 1939 decided to move the Japanese-Mongolian border up to the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol River by force]]. After initial successes the Japanese assault on [[Mongolia]] was checked by the Red Army that inflicted the first major defeat on the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Coox|first=Alvin D.|title=Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1990|page=189|isbn=0804718350}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|first=Amnon|last=Sella|title=Khalkhin-Gol: The Forgotten War|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=18|issue=4|date=October 1983|pages=651–87|ref=harv}}</ref>

These clashes convinced the Japanese government that they should focus on conciliating the Soviet government to avoid interference in the war against China and instead turn their military attention southward, towards the US and European holdings in the Pacific. They also prevented the sacking of experienced Soviet military leaders such as Zhukov, who would later play a vital role in the [[battle of Moscow|defence of Moscow]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chaney|first=Otto Preston|title=Zhukov|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1996|page=76|isbn=0806128070}}</ref>

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher [[gross domestic product]] than the European Axis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.<ref name="6Econ3">{{Cite book|last=Harrison|first=Mark|title=The Economics of World War II: Six Great Powers in International Comparison|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521785030|page=3}}</ref> In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.<ref name="6Econ3"/>

In Europe, occupation came under two very different forms.

At the start of the war, most commanders saw that the threat of enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.<ref name="EncWWII_108">{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=108|isbn=1576079996}}</ref> This line of thinking was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat; the latter factor, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.<ref name="EncWWII_125"/> Many means of [[anti-tank warfare|destroying tanks]], including [[Indirect fire|indirect artillery]], [[anti-tank gun]]s (both towed and [[self-propelled gun|self-propelled]]), [[anti-tank mine|mines]], short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were utilised.<ref name="EncWWII_108" /> Even with large-scale mechanisation of the various armies, the infantry remained the backbone of all forces,<ref name="EncWWII_734">{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=734|isbn=1576079996}}</ref> and throughout the war, most infantry equipment was similar to that utilised in World War I.<ref name="Comp_221">{{Cite book|last=Cowley|first=Robert|last2=Parker|first2=Geoffrey|title=The Reader's Companion to Military History|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2001|isbn=0618127429|page=221}}</ref>

Another advance was the spread of the portable [[machine gun]], a notable example being the German [[MG42]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were well suited to close-quarters combat in urban and jungle settings.<ref name="Comp_221" /> The [[assault rifle]], a late war development which incorporated many of the best features of the [[rifle]] and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for nearly all armed forces.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Infantry Weapons Of World War 2 |url=http://greyfalcon.us/Infantry%20Weapons%20Of%20World%20War%202.htm |publisher=Grey Falcon (Black Sun) |accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=These all-purpose guns were developed and used by the German army in the 2nd half of World War 2 as a result of studies which showed that the ordinary rifle's long range is much longer than needed, since the soldiers almost always fired at enemies closer than half of its effective range. The assault rifle is a balanced compromise between the rifle and the sub-machine gun, having sufficient range and accuracy to be used as a rifle, combined with the rapid-rate automatic firepower of the sub machine gun. Thanks to these combined advantages, assault rifles such as the American M-16 and the Russian AK-47 are the basic weapon of the modern soldier}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine|publisher= Amnesty International |first=Oliver|last=Sprague|first2=Hugh|last2=Griffiths|publisher=controlarms.org|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT30/011/2006/en/11079910-d422-11dd-8743-d305bea2b2c7/act300112006en.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2009|year=2006|format=PDF|page=1}}</ref>
