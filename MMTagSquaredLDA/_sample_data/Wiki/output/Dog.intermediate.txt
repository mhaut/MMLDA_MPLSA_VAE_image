''Dog'' is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies ''Canis lupus familiaris''.  The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus ''Canis'', or "true dogs", including the [[wolf]], [[coyote]], and [[jackal]]s; or it can refer to the members of the subfamily Caninae, which would also include the [[African wild dog]]; or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the [[fox]]es, [[bush dog]], [[raccoon dog]], and others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rasmussen |first=G.

In 14th century England, ''[[hound]]'' (from {{lang-ang|hund}}) was the general word for all domestic canines, and ''dog'' referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff.

In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a ''dog'', while a female is called a ''bitch'' (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a ''[[litter (animal)|litter]]''. The father of a litter is called the ''sire'', and the mother is called the ''dam''. Offspring are generally called ''pups'' or ''[[puppy|puppies]]'', from French ''poupée'', until they are about a year old. The process of birth is ''whelping'', from the Old English word ''hwelp'', (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valp, Icelandic hvelpur) .<ref>{{Cite book|author=Gould, Jean |title=All about dog breeding for quality and soundness |publisher=Pelham |location=London, Eng |year=1978 |isbn=0-7207-1064-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

Domestic dogs inherited a complex [[social hierarchy]] and behaviors from their wolf ancestors. Dogs are [[pack hunter]]s with a complex set of behaviors related to determining each dog's position in the social hierarchy, and they exhibit various postures and other means of [[nonverbal communication]] that reveal their states of mind.<ref name="ADW"/> These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have earned dogs a unique relationship with humans, despite being potentially dangerous [[apex predator]]s.<ref name="miklosi"/>

Although experts largely disagree over the details of [[dog domestication]], it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.<ref name="miklosi"/> Shortly after domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world. Emigrants from [[Siberia]] likely crossed the [[Bering Strait]] with dogs in their company, and some experts suggest the use of [[sled dogs]] may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago. Dogs were an important part of life for the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]] population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the [[Apache]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribes 1,400 years ago. Use of dogs as [[pack animal]]s in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the [[horse]] to North America.<ref name="history">{{Cite book|title=A dogs history of America|author=Mark Derr|year=2004|publisher=North Point Press}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

The current consensus among biologists and archaeologists is that the dating of first domestication is indeterminate.<ref name="miklosi"/><ref name="history"/> There is conclusive evidence dogs genetically diverged from their wolf ancestors at least 15,000 years ago,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lindblad-Toh K, Wade CM, Mikkelsen TS, ''et al.'' |title=Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7069 |pages=803–19 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16341006 |doi=10.1038/nature04338}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Fiennes, Alice; T-W-Fiennes, Richard N. |title=The natural history of the dog |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location=London |year=1968 |isbn=0-297-76455-1}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name="science2002">{{Cite journal|author=Savolainen P, Zhang YP, Luo J, Lundeberg J, Leitner T |title=Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5598 |pages=1610–3 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12446907 |doi=10.1126/science.1073906}}</ref> but some believe domestication to have occurred earlier.<ref name="miklosi"/> It is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a different course prior to domestication. The latter view has gained proponents, such as biologists Raymond and Lorna Coppinger;<ref name="Coppinger"/> they theorize some wolves gathered around the campsites of the paleolithical man to scavenge refuse, and associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored those who were less frightened by, and keener in approaching, humans.

The bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of the domestic dog stems from archaeological findings and [[mitochondrial DNA]] studies. The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years ago,<ref name="miklosi"/><ref name="history"/> and some genetic evidence indicates the domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in the late [[Upper Paleolithic]] close to the [[Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago.<ref name="bbc">{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2498669.stm| title = Origin of dogs traced| accessdate = 29 November 2006| last = McGourty| first = Christine| date = 22 November 2002| publisher=BBC News}}</ref> But there is a wide range of other, contradictory findings that make this issue controversial.

Archaeological evidence suggests the latest dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged much earlier.<ref name="miklosi"/> In 2008, a team of international scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, [[Musk Ox|musk ox]] and reindeer.<ref>"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370 World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big]" ''msnbc'' 17 October 2008.</ref>

DNA studies

<text>

DNA studies have provided a wider range of possible divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,<ref name="science2002"/> to as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Vilà C, Savolainen P, Maldonado JE, ''et al.'' |title=Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5319 |pages=1687–9 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9180076 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5319.1687}}</ref> This evidence depends on a number of assumptions that may be violated.<ref name="miklosi"/> Genetic studies are based on comparisons of [[genetic diversity]] between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolf-coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.<ref>{{harvnb|Miklosi|2007|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=KnVEIrVNGhIC&pg=PA110 110]}}</ref> If this estimate is incorrect, and the actual wolf-coyote divergence is closer to one or two million years ago, or more,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&taxon_no=44854&is_real_user=1 |title=Paleodb.org |publisher=Paleodb.org |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref> then the DNA evidence that supports specific dog-wolf divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.

Furthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by [[selective breeding]]. This could significantly bias DNA analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. These conclusions are based on the location of maximal [[genetic divergence]], and assume hybridization does not occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. Although these assumptions hold for many species, there is good reason to believe that they do not hold for canines.<ref name="miklosi"/>

Genetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended from a handful of domestication events with a small number of founding females,<ref name="miklosi"/><ref name="bbc"/> although there is evidence domesticated dogs [[introgression|interbred with local populations]] of wild wolves on several occasions.<ref name="science2002"/> Data suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout the world, reaching the North American continent around 8000 B.C.<ref name="science2002"/> The oldest groups of dogs, which show the greatest [[genetic variability]] and are the most similar to their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African breeds, including the [[Basenji]], [[Lhasa Apso]], and [[Siberian Husky]].<ref name="parker">{{Cite journal|author=Parker HG, Kim LV, Sutter NB, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5674 |pages=1160–4 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15155949 |doi=10.1126/science.1097406}}</ref> Some breeds thought to be very old, such as the [[Pharaoh Hound]], [[Ibizan Hound]], and [[Norwegian Elkhound]], are now known to have been created more recently.<ref name="parker"/>

There is a great deal of controversy surrounding the evolutionary framework for the domestication of dogs.<ref name="miklosi">{{Cite book|last = Miklosi |first= Adam|title= Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EUrXahLxUL8C|isbn = 0-19-929585-9|ref=harv}}</ref> Although it is widely claimed that "man domesticated the wolf,"<ref name="koler2002">{{Cite journal|journal=Anthrozoos|title=The Origin of the Dog Revisited|author=Janice Koler-Matznick|year=2002}}</ref> man may not have taken such a proactive role in the process.<ref name="miklosi"/> The nature of the interaction between man and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and controversial. At least three early species of the ''Homo'' genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact with canine species. Despite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of canine species to the presence of the close relatives of modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would have coincided with a large expansion in human territory and the development of agriculture. This has led some biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in the form of established human settlements. Permanent settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of disposable food and would have created a barrier between wild and anthropogenic canine populations.<ref name="miklosi"/>

The working dogs are trained properly and accordingly to the activities they will perform. Yet, despite the size of some dogs, they are sometimes used as pets as well. However, they generally require special training and owners might have to learn how to bond with their pets, in these cases.

Some of these dogs are suitable for more than a single activity. For instance, Akita is a popular dog in the show ring, but its qualities make it a reliable animal in [[therapy]] work. The Alaskan Malamute is one of the most powerful and strong working dogs, and although some families have this type of breed as a pet, they are more likely to enjoy [[sledding]], and performing different mountainous activities with their owners. The Anatolian Shepherd dog and the Black Russian Terrier are famous for their ability to work as [[guard dogs]], being used to protect livestock. The Swiss Mountain dogs, Bullmastiffs and German Pinschers are suitable for [[carting]], obedience, tracking and even therapy work.

Boxers are commonly used as [[service dogs]] for blind people because of their [[intelligence]] and alert expression. During [[war]] time, this type of dog was also used as a [[courier]]. Dobermans have proven themselves as great learners with an amazing capacity of retaining training, and as a result, they are commonly trained and used as [[Police dogs|police]] or war dogs. Some other types of breeds are easily trained for [[hunting]] or fighting, such as the Dogue de Bordeaux.

Owners of dogs often enter them in competitions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm|title=A Beginner's Guide to Dog Shows|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref> such as breed conformation shows or [[list of dog sports|sports]], including racing and sledding.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

Pets entering the shelters are euthanized in countries all over the world because of the lack of financial provisions to take care of these animals. Most shelters complain of not having enough resources to feed the pets and by being constrained to kill them, as the likelihood for all of them to find an owner is very small. In poor countries, [[euthanasia]] is usually violent.

Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<ref name="ADW"/> Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that of their wild ancestors, gray wolves.<ref name="ADW"/>
Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a [[Yorkshire Terrier]], that stood only {{convert|6.3|cm}} at the shoulder, {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only {{convert|113|g}}.

[[File:Poligraf Poligrafovich.JPG|thumb|A heavy winter coat with countershading in a [[mixed-breed dog]]]]
The [[pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or "single", with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,<ref name="About.com">{{cite web|url=http://animals.about.com/od/zoology12/f/countershading.htm|title=What is Counter Shading?|last= Klappenbach|first=Laura|year=2008|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> which reduces its general visibility.

Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, [[zoonosis|some of which can affect humans]]. To defend against many common diseases, dogs are often [[vaccination of dogs|vaccinated]].

[[File:Terrier mixed-breed dog.jpg|thumb|A mixed-breed dog]]
Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow dysplasia|elbow]] or [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[blindness]], [[deafness]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis|pulmonic stenosis]], [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and [[luxating patella|trick knees]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[neutering|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[bloat]], which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mite]]s, as well as [[hookworm]], [[cestoda|tapeworm]], [[nematode|roundworm]], and [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworm]].

Dogs are highly susceptible to [[theobromine poisoning]], typically from ingestion of [[chocolate]]. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including [[diabetes in dogs|diabetes]], dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dogtime.com/diseases-shared-by-humans-pets-ernie-ward.html|title=Diseases shared by humans and pets|author=Ward, Dr. Ernie|publisher=Dogtime.com|accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

In domestic dogs, [[puberty|sexual maturity]] begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,<ref name="ADW"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first [[estrous cycle]]. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles biannually, during which the body prepares for [[pregnancy]]. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to [[sexual intercourse|copulation]].<ref name="ADW"/> Because the [[ovum|ova]] survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.<ref name="ADW"/>

Dogs bear their litters roughly 56 to 72 days after [[fertilization]],<ref name="ADW"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpvh.com/Articles/36.html|title=Normal gestation in dogs|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary.

[[Toy dog]]s generally produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.

Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male [[French Bulldog]]s, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female.

[[Neutering]] refers to the [[sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] of animals, usually by removal of the male's [[testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter/ | title=Top 10 reasons to spay/neuter your pet | publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals | accessdate = 16 May 2007}}</ref>

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], 3–4&nbsp;million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|put down]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes.

{{Main|Dog intelligence}}

[[File:Border Collie liver portrait.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Border Collie]] is considered to be one of the most intelligent breeds.]]
The domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.<ref name="coren"/> Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as through simple [[reinforcement learning|reinforcement]] (e.g. [[classical conditioning|classical]] or [[operant conditioning]]) and by observation.<ref name="coren"/>

Dogs go through a series of stages of cognitive development. As with [[human]]s, the understanding that objects not being actively perceived still remain in existence (called [[object permanence]]) is not present at birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks of age.<ref name="coren"/>

Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs.<ref name="coren"/> This form of intelligence is not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies who watched an experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those who were left to solve the problem on their own.<ref name="coren"/><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/dev.420100310|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume =10|issue=3|pages= 267–271|year=2004|title = Ontogeny of observational learning in the dog (Canis familiaris)|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/109705129/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|author=Dr. Leonore Loeb Adler, Helmut E. Adler|pmid=863122}}</ref> Dogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three-quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.<ref name="hungary">{{Cite journal|author=Kubinyi, E., Topal, J., & Miklosi, A. |year=2003|title=Dogs (canis familiaris) learn their owners via observation in a manipulation task.|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.117.2.156|volume=117|page=156}}</ref> Another study found that handing an object between experimenters who then used the object's name in a sentence successfully taught an observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to subsequently retrieve the item.<ref name="mckinley">{{Cite journal|title=The efficacy of the model-rival method when compared to operant conditioning for training domestic dogs to perform a retrieval-selection task.|journal=AABS|year=2003}}</ref>

Dogs also demonstrate sophisticated [[social cognition]] by associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.<ref name="coren"/> One such class of social cognition involves the understanding that others are conscious agents. Research has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.<ref name="hare">{{Cite journal|author=Hare, B., Brown, M., Williamson, C., & Tomasello, M.|year=2002|title=The domestication of social cognition in dogs|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1072702|volume=298|page=1634|pmid=12446914|month=Nov|first1=B|first2=M|first3=C|first4=M|issue=5598|pages=1634–6|issn=0036-8075}}</ref> The results showed that domestic dogs were better than [[chimpanzee]]s, wolves, and human infants at this task, and even young puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.<ref name="coren"/>

Psychology research has shown that [[Facial symmetry|human faces are asymmetrical]] with the gaze instinctively moving to the right side of a face upon encountering other humans to obtain information about their emotions and state. Research at the [[University of Lincoln]] (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such they are the only non-[[primate]] species known to do so.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=K Guo, C Hall, S Hall, K Meints, D Mills|title=Left gaze bias in human infants, rhesus monkeys, and domestic dogs|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36 ECVP|url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v070385|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Dogs can read emotion in human faces|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3354028/Dogs-can-read-emotion-in-human-faces.html|accessdate=24 June 2010|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=29 October 2008|location=London}}</ref>

Dr. [[Stanley Coren]], an expert on dog psychology, states that these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition which distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the wolf.<ref name="coren"/> Studies have also investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending on the attention-state of their partner.<ref name="ach">{{Cite journal|title= Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play|journal=Journal Animal Cognition|publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|volume=12|year=2009|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r338v42481024317|accessdate=18 February 2009}}</ref> Those studies showed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.<ref name="ach"/>

Dr. Coren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including one example where a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room.<ref name="coren"/> Although this could have been accidental, Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. Together, the empirical data and [[anecdotal evidence]] points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of [[theory of mind]].<ref name="coren"/><ref name="ach"/>

{{Main|Dog behavior}}
{{See|:Category:Dog training and behavior}}

Although dogs have been the subject of a great deal of [[behaviorism|behaviorist psychology]] (e.g. [[Classical conditioning|Pavlov's dog]]), they do not enter the world with a psychological "blank slate".<ref name="coren"/> Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as well as environmental factors.<ref name="coren"/> Domestic dogs exhibit a number of behaviors and predispositions that were inherited from wolves.<ref name="coren"/> The [[Gray Wolf]] is a [[social animal]] that has evolved a sophisticated means of communication and [[social structure]]. The domestic dog has inherited some of these predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, such as the dog's highly developed [[social cognition]], are found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.<ref name="hare"/>

The existence and nature of personality traits in dogs have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) and five consistent and stable "narrow traits" identified, described as playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness–boldness was also identified.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00121-1|last=Kenth Svartberga, Björn Forkman|first1=K|title=Personality traits in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris)|journal=Applied animal behavior science|date=14 June 2002|month=10|volume=79|issue=2|pages=133–155|url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(02)00121-1/abstract|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.04.011|last=Svartberg et al|first1=K|last2=Tapper|first2=I|last3=Temrin|first3=H|last4=Radesater|first4=T|last5=Thorman|first5=S|title=Consistency of personality traits in dogs|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=26 April 2004|year=2005|month=February|volume=69|issue=2|pages=283–291|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W9W-4DPYJ2J-4&_user=10&_coverDate=02%2F01%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1380990863&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=0c764b2ec4f26d28ab7524c019c1f295|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

Dog growl
</heading>
<text>

A new study in Budapest, Hungary has found that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl. A specific growl used by dogs to protect their food. The research also shows that dogs do not lie about their size, and this is the first time research has shown animals can determine another’s size by the sound it makes. The test used image of many kind of dogs and together showed a small and big dog and also a growl. The result, showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of the appropriate-sized dog first and looked at it longest.<ref>Dogs can tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1340191/Dogs-tell-big-dog-just-listening-growl.html</ref>

Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,<ref>{{Cite book| author=Serpell, James| title=The Domestic Dog; its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people|year=1995|isbn=0-521-42537-9|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

It is thought by certain experts that the dog's limp ears are a result of [[atrophy]] of the jaw muscles.<ref name="DOGS" /> The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some [[Inuit]] tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.<ref name="DOGS" /> The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves.<ref name="Lopez">{{Cite book| author=Lopez, Barry|title = Of wolves and men|year = 1978|isbn = 0743249364|publisher=Scribner Classics|location = New York|page = 320}}</ref>

Behavior
</heading>
<text>

Dogs tend to be poorer than wolves at [[observational learning]], being more responsive to [[operant conditioning|instrumental conditioning]].<ref name="DOGS" /> Feral dogs show little of the complex social structure or [[dominance hierarchy]] present in wolf packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in locating food items, and are more like competitors.<ref name="DOGS" /> Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor [[ungulate]] hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations where they are [[sympatric speciation|sympatric]]. However, feral dogs have been reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the [[Galápagos Islands]],<ref name="Evolution">{{Cite book| author=Serpell, James| title=The Domestic Dog; its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people|year=1995|isbn=0-521-42537-9|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location= Cambridge|page= 267}}</ref> and free ranging pet dogs are more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.

Despite common belief, domestic dogs can be [[monogamy|monogamous]].<ref name="Pal">{{Cite journal|author=Pal SK |title=Parental care in free-ranging dogs, Canis familiaris |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=31–47 |year=2005 |month=January |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.002}}</ref> Breeding in feral packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a dominant alpha pair (despite common belief, such things also occur in wolf packs).<ref>Günther Bloch: Die Pizza-Hunde. ISBN 978-3-440-10986-1</ref> Male dogs are unusual among canids by the fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females to increase their own reproductive success.<ref name="Evolution" /> Some sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species by the fact that they do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same territory.<ref name="DOGS" />
[[File:Beagle-Shepard Mixed-breed dog - Sitting.png|thumb|alt=A dog displaying mastery of the command "sit"|An [[Australian Shepherd]]-[[Beagle]] mix displaying mastery of the "sit" command.]]

However, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, [[dingo]]s as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.<ref name="Pal"/><ref>Eberhard Trumler, Mit dem Hund auf du; Zum Verständnis seines Wesens und Verhaltens; 4.

Dogs display much greater tractability than tame wolves, and are generally much more responsive to coercive techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli, and force than wolves, which are most responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards.<ref name="training">{{cite web| url= http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html| title= Are wolves and wolfdog hybrids trainable?|publisher=Wolf Park| accessdate= 30 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615124627/http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 June 2008}}</ref> Unlike tame wolves, dogs tend to respond more to voice than hand signals.<ref name="training2">{{cite web| url= http://www.wolfpark.org/training/Example-1.html| title= Wolf Training and Socialisation: Example #1|publisher=Wolf Park| accessdate= 30 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080210012443/http://www.wolfpark.org/training/Example-1.html |archivedate = 10 February 2008}}</ref>
