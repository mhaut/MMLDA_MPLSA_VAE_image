[[Image:Rentier fws 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Large male reindeer]]
The reindeer is a widespread and numerous species in the northern [[Holarctic]], being present in both [[tundra]] and [[taiga]] (boreal forest).<ref name=walker>Novak, R. M. (editor) (1999). ''Walker's Mammals of the World.'' Vol. 2. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. Pp. 1128-1130. ISBN 0-8018-5789-9</ref> Originally, the reindeer was found in [[Scandinavia]], eastern [[Europe]], [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]], and northern [[China]] north of the [[50th parallel north|50th latitude]]. In North America, it was found in [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] ([[USA]]), and the northern conterminous USA from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to [[Maine]]. In the 19th century, it was apparently still present in southern [[Idaho]].<ref name=IUCN/> It also occurred naturally on [[Sakhalin]], [[Greenland]], and probably even in historical times in [[Ireland]]. During the late [[Pleistocene]] era, reindeer were found as far south as [[Nevada]] and [[Tennessee]] in North America and [[Spain]] in Europe.<ref name=walker/><ref>Sommer R. S. and Nadachowski A.: ''Glacial refugia of mammals in Europe: evidence from fossil records.'' Mammal Rev. 2006, Volume 36, No. 4, 251-265.</ref> Today, wild reindeer have disappeared from many areas within this large historical range, especially from the southern parts, where it vanished almost everywhere. Large populations of wild reindeer are still found in [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Siberia]], [[Greenland]], [[Alaska]], and [[Canada]].

[[Image:RangiferTarandus.jpg|thumb|left|Southernmost reindeer: a [[South Georgia]]n reindeer with velvet-covered antlers]]
[[Domestication|Domesticated]] reindeer are mostly found in northern [[Fennoscandia]] and Russia, with a herd of approximately 150-170 reindeer living around the [[Cairngorms]] region in [[Scotland]]. The last remaining wild tundra reindeer in Europe are found in portions of southern [[Norway]].<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4491 Europe's last wild reindeer herds in peril]</ref>

A few reindeer from Norway were introduced to the South Atlantic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] in the beginning of the 20th century. Today, there are two distinct herds still thriving there, permanently separated by [[glacier]]s. Their total numbers are no more than a few thousand. The [[flag]] and the [[coat of arms]] of the territory contain an image of a reindeer. Around 4000 reindeer have been introduced into the French sub-Antarctic archipelago of [[Kerguelen Islands]]. East [[Iceland]] has a small herd of about 2500–3000 animals.<ref>''[http://www.internationaladventure.com/iceland/reindeer.html Reindeer Hunting in Iceland.]'' International Adventure. Accessed 12 November 2010.</ref>

Caribou and reindeer numbers have fluctuated historically, but many herds are in decline across their range.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8094000/8094036.stm BBC Earth News-Reindeer herds in global decline]</ref> This global decline is linked to [[climate change]] for northern, migratory caribou and reindeer herds and industrial disturbance of caribou habitat for sedentary, non-migratory herds.<ref name=Vors>Vors & Boyce.

Fur
</heading>
<text>

The colour of the [[fur]] varies considerably, both individually, and depending on season and subspecies. Northern populations, which usually are relatively small, are whiter, while southern populations, which typically are relatively large, are darker. This can be seen well in North America, where the northermost subspecies, the [[Peary Caribou]], is the whitest and smallest subspecies of the continent, while the southermost subspecies, the [[Migratory Woodland Caribou|Woodland Caribou]], is the darkest and largest.<ref name=NorthAmerica>Reid, F. (2006). ''Mammals of North America.'' Peterson Field Guides. ISBN 978-0-395-93596-5</ref> The [[Coat (animal)|coat]] has two layers of fur, a dense [[wool]]ly undercoat and longer-haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air-filled hairs.

Antlers
</heading>
<text>

[[Image:ReindeerLoosingVelvet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Reindeer antlers grow again each year under a layer of fur called velvet. This reindeer is losing the velvet layer on one of its antlers.]]
In most populations both sexes grow [[antler]]s,<ref name=antlers/> which (in the Scandinavian variety) for old males fall off in December, for young males in the early spring, and for females in the summer. The antlers typically have two separate groups of points, a lower and upper. [[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated]] reindeer are shorter-legged and heavier than their wild counterparts. There is considerable subspecific variation in the size of the antlers (e.g., rather small and spindly in the northernmost subspecies),<ref name=NorthAmerica/> but in some subspecies the bull reindeer's antlers are the second largest of any extant deer, after the [[moose]], and can range up to {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} in width and {{convert|135|cm|abbr=on}} in beam length. They have the largest antlers relative to body size among deer.<ref name=antlers/>


</text>
<heading>
Nose and hooves
</heading>
<text>

Reindeer have specialized noses featuring nasal [[nasal concha|turbinate bone]]s that dramatically increase the surface area within the [[nostril]]s. Incoming cold air is warmed by the animal's [[Thermoregulation|body heat]] before entering the lungs, and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the deer's breath is exhaled, used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly absorbed into the blood through the [[mucous membrane]]s.

Reindeer [[hoof|hooves]] adapt to the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof, which cuts into the [[ice]] and crusted [[snow]] to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an activity known as "cratering")<ref name=cratering>"In the winter, the fleshy pads on these toes grow longer and form a tough, hornlike rim. Caribou use these large, sharp-edged hooves to dig through the snow and uncover the lichens that sustain them in winter months. Biologists call this activity "cratering" because of the crater-like cavity the caribou’s hooves leave in the snow." [http://www.taiga.net/projectcaribou/pdf/allaboutcaribou.PDF All About Caribou] - Project Caribou</ref><ref name=cratering_image>[http://www.arcticphoto.co.uk/stories/avkas/ry0246-32.htm Image of reindeer cratering in snow.]</ref> through the snow to their favorite food, a [[lichen]] known as [[Cladonia rangiferina|reindeer moss]]. The knees of many species of reindeer are adapted to produce a clicking sound as they walk.<ref name=clicking>Banfield AWF: '''The caribou'''. In ''The Unbelievable Land''. Edited by: Smith IN.

Reindeer are [[ruminant]]s, having a four-chambered stomach. They mainly eat [[lichen]]s in winter, especially reindeer moss. However, they also eat the leaves of [[willow]]s and [[birch]]es, as well as [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[grass]]es. There is some evidence to suggest that on occasion, they will also feed on [[lemming]]s,<ref>[http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=91 Lemmings] at [[Hinterland Who's Who]]</ref> [[arctic char]], and [[egg (biology)|bird eggs]].<ref>Terrestrial Mammals of Nunavut by Ingrid Anand-Wheeler.

Reproduction
</heading>
<text>

Mating occurs from late September to early November. Males battle for access to females. Two males will lock each other's antlers together and try to push each other away. The most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 females to mate with. A male will stop eating during this time and lose much of its body reserves.

Calves may be born the following May or June. After 45 days, the calves are able to graze and forage but continue suckling until the following autumn and become independent from their mothers.


</text>
<heading>
Migration
</heading>

Some populations of the North American caribou [[Animal migration|migrate]] the furthest of any terrestrial mammal, traveling up to {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} a year, and covering {{convert|1000000|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IUCN/><ref>[http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/wildlife/maps-caribou/ Caribou Migration Monitoring by Satellite Telemetry]</ref> Other populations (e.g., in Europe) have a shorter migration, and some, for example the subspecies ''R. t. pearsoni'' and ''R. t. platyrhynchus'' (both restricted to islands), are residents that only make local movements.

Normally travelling about {{convert|19|-|55|km|abbr=on}} a day while migrating, the caribou can run at speeds of {{convert|60|-|80|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IUCN/> During the spring migration smaller herds will group together to form larger herds of 50,000 to 500,000 animals but during autumn migrations, the groups become smaller, and the reindeer begin to mate. During the winter, reindeer travel to forested areas to forage under the snow. By spring, groups leave their winter grounds to go to the calving grounds. A reindeer can swim easily and quickly, normally at {{convert|6.5|km/h|abbr=on}} but if necessary at {{convert|10|km/h|abbr=on}}, and migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river.<ref name=IUCN/>

Predators
</heading>
<text>

There are a variety of predators that prey heavily on reindeer. [[Golden Eagle]]s prey on calves and are the most prolific hunter on calving grounds.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8314000/8314558.stm Eagles filmed hunting reindeer]</ref> [[Wolverine]] will take newborn calves or birthing cows, as well as (less commonly) infirm adults. [[Brown Bear]]s and (in the rare cases where they encounter each other) [[Polar bear]]s prey on reindeer of all ages but (as with the wolverine) are most likely to attack weaker animals such as calves and sick deer. The [[Gray Wolf]] is the most effective natural predator of adult reindeer, especially during the winter. As carrion, caribou are fed on by [[fox]]es, [[raven]]s and [[hawk]]s. Blood-sucking insects, such as [[Black fly|black flies]] and [[mosquito]]es, are a plague to reindeer during the summer and can cause enough stress to inhibit feeding and calving behaviors.<ref>[http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/caribou/Predators.html Caribou Foes: Natural Predators in the Wilderness]</ref> In one case, the entire body of a reindeer was found in a [[Greenland shark]] (possibly a case of [[scavenging]]),<ref>[http://www.postmodern.com/~fi/sharkpics/ellis/greenlan.htm Greenland Shark (Somniosus microcephalus)]</ref> a species found in the far northern [[Atlantic]]. The population numbers of some of these predators is influenced by the migration of reindeer. During the Ice Ages, they faced [[Dire wolf|Dire wolves]], [[Cave lion]]s, [[American lion]]s, [[Short-faced bear]]s, [[Cave hyena]]s, [[Smilodon]]s, [[Jaguar]]s, [[Cougar]]s, and possibly the [[ground sloth]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Subspecies
</heading>
<text>

[[Image:Mech 06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peary Caribou]] is a relatively small and pale subspecies found in the tundra of far northern North America. Unsurprisingly, it is part of the group known as Tundra reindeer.]]
Since 1961, reindeer have been divided into two major groups, the tundra reindeer with six subspecies and the woodland reindeer with three subspecies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Among the tundra subspecies are small-bodied, high-Arctic island forms. These island subspecies are probably not closely related, since the Svalbard Reindeer seems to have evolved from large European Reindeer, whereas Peary Caribou and the extinct Arctic Reindeer are closely related and probably evolved in high-Arctic North America.<ref name=HighArctic/>

The following list is partial, as four subspecies which are restricted to Russia and neighbouring regions have been left out. These are ''R. tarandus buskensis'', ''R. tarandus pearsoni'' ([[Novaya Zemlya]] Reindeer), ''R. tarandus phylarchus'' ([[Kamchatka]]/[[Sea of Okhotsk|Okhotsk]] Reindeer) and ''R. tarandus sibiricus'' ([[Siberia]]n Tundra Reindeer).<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Grubb|id=14200328}}</ref>

Hunting

[[File:Caribouhighway.JPG|thumb|right|Reindeer are hunted in the area of the [[Denali Highway]] in Alaska during the autumn]]
{{See also|Reindeer hunting in Greenland}}
Reindeer hunting by humans has a very long history, and caribou/wild reindeer "may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting."<ref name=Burch/>

Humans started hunting reindeer in the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods, and humans are today the main predator in many areas. Norway and Greenland have unbroken traditions of hunting wild reindeer from the [[ice age]] until the present day. In the non-forested mountains of central [[Norway]], such as [[Jotunheimen]], it is still possible to find remains of stone-built [[trapping pit]]s, guiding fences, and bow rests, built especially for hunting reindeer. These can, with some certainty, be dated to the [[Migration Period]], although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the [[Stone Age]].

[[Norway]] is now preparing to apply for nomination as a [[World Heritage Site]] for areas with traces and traditions of reindeer hunting in [[Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park]], [[Reinheimen National Park]] and [[Rondane National Park]] in Central Sør-Norge ([[Southern Norway]]). There is in these parts of Norway an unbroken tradition of reindeer hunting from post-glacial stone age until today.

Wild caribou are still hunted in North America and Greenland. In the traditional lifestyle of the [[Inuit]] people, Northern [[First Nations]] people, [[Alaska Natives]], and the [[Kalaallit]] of Greenland, the caribou is an important source of food, clothing, shelter, and tools. Many [[Gwichʼin]] people, who depend on the [[Porcupine caribou]], still follow traditional caribou management practices that include a prohibition against selling caribou meat and limits on the number of caribou to be taken per hunting trip.<ref>[http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/ANWR/anwrgwichin1.html Gwichʼin Traditional Management Practices]</ref>

The blood of the caribou was supposedly mixed with alcohol as drink by hunters and loggers in colonial Quebec to counter the cold. This drink is now enjoyed without the blood as a wine and whiskey drink known as ''[[Caribou (drink)|Caribou]]''.<ref>{{citation |first=Sébastien |last=Mieusset |title=Le "Temps des sucres" au Québec |url=http://www.cuisine.tv/cid6799/le-temps-des-sucres-au-quebec.html}}</ref><ref name=ass>{{citation|title=Quebec’s Carnaval is worth freezing your a** off for |first=Julie |last=Ovenell-Carter |date=06-02-2009 |publisher=theseboots.travel |url=http://theseboots.travel/2009/02/06/worth-repeating-quebecs-carnaval-is-worth-freezing-your-a-off-for/}}</ref>

[[Image:Archangel reindeer3.jpg|right|thumb|A reindeer sled, [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Russia]]. Late nineteenth-century [[photochrom]].]]
[[Image:Reindeer milking.jpg|thumb|right|Milking reindeer in the 19th century]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-119-0413-32, Norwegen, deutscher Soldat, Einheimischer.jpg|thumb|Reindeer [[fur coat]]]]

Reindeer have been [[Herding|herded]] for centuries by several Arctic and Subarctic people including the [[Sami people|Sami]] and the [[Nenets people|Nenets]]. They are raised for their meat, hides, antlers and, to a lesser extent, for milk and transportation. Reindeer are not considered fully domesticated, as they generally roam free on pasture grounds. In traditional nomadic herding, reindeer herders migrate with their herds between coast and inland areas according to an annual migration route, and herds are keenly tended. However, reindeer were not bred in captivity, though they were tamed for milking as well as for use as draught animals or [[Working animal|beasts of burden]].

The use of reindeer as semi-domesticated livestock in Alaska was introduced in the late 19th century by the [[U.S. Revenue Cutter Service]], with assistance from [[Sheldon Jackson]], as a means of providing a livelihood for [[Indigenous peoples|Native peoples]] there.<ref>King, Irving H.(1996). ''The Coast Guard Expands'', p. 86-91. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland. ISBN 155750458X.</ref> Reindeer were imported first from Siberia, and later also from Norway. A regular mail run in [[Wales, Alaska]], used a sleigh drawn by reindeer.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6RcWb-PNMiMC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=reindeer+mail+wales&source=bl&ots=ci568lJvIn&sig=A8pfb22tvmQvMTcYFVrqdEel75k&hl=en&ei=O1PSTJLnLYm4sAPPzs3ICw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=reindeer%20mail%20wales&f=false  Annual report on introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska, Volume 14]</ref> In Alaska, reindeer herders use [[satellite]] telemetry to track their herds, using online maps and databases to chart the herd's progress.

Economy
</heading>
<text>

The reindeer has (or has had) an important economic role for all [[List of indigenous peoples#Circumpolar North|circumpolar peoples]], including the Saami, Nenets, [[Khanty people|Khants]], [[Evenks]], [[Yukaghir]]s, Chukchi, and [[Koryaks]] in Eurasia. It is believed that domestication started between the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s. Siberian deer owners also use the reindeer to ride on (Siberian reindeer are larger than their Scandinavian relatives). For breeders, a single owner may own hundreds or even thousands of animals. The numbers of Russian herders have been drastically reduced since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. The fur and meat is sold, which is an important source of income. Reindeer were introduced into Alaska near the end of the 19th century; they interbreed with native caribou subspecies there. Reindeer herders on the [[Seward Peninsula]] have experienced significant losses to their herds from animals (such as wolves) following the wild caribou during their migrations.

Reindeer [[meat]] is popular in the Scandinavian countries. Reindeer [[meatball]]s are sold canned. [[Sautéed reindeer]] is the best-known dish in Lapland. In Alaska and Finland, reindeer [[sausage]] is sold in supermarkets and [[grocery store]]s. Reindeer meat is very tender and lean. It can be prepared fresh, but also dried, salted, hot- and cold-[[smoking (food)|smoked]]. In addition to meat, almost all internal organs of reindeer can be eaten, some being traditional dishes.<ref>[http://www.saunalahti.fi/~marian1/gourmet/reindeer.htm]</ref> Furthermore, ''Lapin Poron liha'' fresh Reindeer meat completely produced and packed in [[Finnish Lapland]] is protected in Europe with [[PDO]] classification.<ref name="60N">'' '[http://60north.mmm.fi/news?&article=13673753&section=05 Lapland Reindeer meat protected in the EU]' '' 60°North Magazine (Accessed 19 July 2010)</ref><ref name="DOOR">[http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/list.html European Commission PDO/PGI list] (Accessed 19 July 2010)</ref>

Reindeer antler is powdered and sold as an [[aphrodisiac]], nutritional or medicinal supplement to Asian markets.

Caribou have been a major source of subsistence for Canadian [[Inuit]].

In history
</heading>
<text>

Both [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] have short accounts - probably based on the same source - of an ox-sized deer species, named ''tarandos'', living in the land of the [[Budini|Bodines]] in [[Scythia]], which was able to change the colour of its fur to obtain camouflage. The latter is probably a misunderstanding of the seasonal change in reindeer fur colour. The descriptions have been interpreted as being of reindeer living in the southern [[Ural Mountains]] at c. 350 BC<ref name=Sarauw>{{Cite book|last1= Sarauw |first1= Georg | authorlink1= Georg F.L.

A deer-like animal described by [[Julius Caesar]] in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' (chapter 6.26) from the [[Hercynian Forest]] in the year 53 BC is most certainly to be interpreted as reindeer:<ref name=Sarauw/><ref>"Est bos cervi figura, cuius a media fronte inter aures unum cornu* exsistit excelsius magisque directum his, quae nobis nota sunt, cornibus: ab eius summo sicut palmae ramique* late diffunduntur.

According to [[Olaus Magnus]]'s [[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]] - printed in [[Rome]] in 1555 - [[Gustav I of Sweden]] sent 10 reindeer to [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia]], in the year 1533. It may be these animals that [[Conrad Gessner]] had seen or heard of.

Name etymology
</heading>
<text>

The name '''rangifer''', which [[Linnaeus]] chose as the name for the reindeer [[genus]], was used by [[Albertus Magnus]] in his ''De animalibus'', fol. Liber 22, Cap. 268: "Dicitur Rangyfer quasi ramifer". This word may go back to a [[Saami]] word ''raingo''.<ref name=Sarauw/> For the origin of the word '''tarandus''', which [[Linnaeus]] chose as the species [[epithet]], he made reference to [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]]'s ''Quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia'' fol. 859—863, Cap. 30: De Tarando (1621). However, [[Ulisse Aldrovandi|Aldrovandi]] - and before him [[Konrad Gesner]]<ref>Gesner, K. (1617) ''Historia animalium. Liber 1, De quadrupedibus viviparis''. Tiguri 1551. p. 156: De Tarando. 9. 950: De Rangifero.</ref> - thought that ''rangifer'' and ''tarandus'' were two separate animals.<ref>Aldrovandi, U. (1621) ''Quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia''. Bononiæ. Cap. 30: De Tarando - Cap. 31: De Rangifero.</ref> In any case, the ''tarandos'' name goes back to [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] - see above.

Local names
</heading>
<text>

The name ''rein'' (-deer) is of [[Norsemen|Norse]] origin ([[Old Norse]] ''hreinn'', which again goes back to [[Proto-Germanic]] *hraina and [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *kroino meaning "horned animal"). In the [[Finno-Permic languages|Finno-Permic]] languages, [[Sami languages|Sami]] ''poatsu'' (in [[Northern Sami]] ''boazu'', in [[Lule Sami]] ''boatsoj'', in [[Pite Sami]] ''båtsoj'', in [[Southern Sami]] ''bovtse''), [[Mari language|Mari]] ''pučə'' and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]] ''pudžej'', all referring to domesticated reindeer, go back to *počaw, an Iranian loanword deriving from Proto-Indo-European *peḱu-, meaning "cattle". The Finnish name ''poro'' may also stem from the same.<ref>Koivulehti, Jorma (2007): Saamen ja suomen 'poro'. Mémoires de la Société Finno-Ougrienne 253. http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust253/sust253_koivulehto.pdf</ref> The name ''caribou'' comes, through French, from [[Míkmaq language|Mi'kmaq]] ''qalipu'', meaning "snow shoveler", referring to its habit of pawing through the snow for food.<ref>Flexner, Stuart Berg and Leonore Crary Hauck, eds. (1987). ''The Random House Dictionary of the English Language'', 2nd ed. (unabridged). New York: Random House, pp. 315-16)</ref> In [[Inuktitut]], the caribou is known by the name ''tuttuk'' (Labrador dialect). In Cree-Montagnais-Naskapi dialects the caribou is called ''atihkw''.

{{Main|Santa Claus's reindeer}}

In the [[Santa Claus]] myth, Santa Claus's sleigh is pulled by flying reindeer. These were first named in the 1823 poem "[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]", where they are called Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder<!-- NOT DONNER, READ THE SOURCE -->, and Blixem<!-- NOT BLITZEN, READ THE SOURCE -->.<ref name="My Merry Christmas">[http://mymerrychristmas.com/2005/reindeer.shtml "The Legendary Role of Reindeer in Christmas], Jeff Westover, My Merry Christmas, ''accessed 27 December 2007''</ref> Dunder was later changed to Donder and—in other works—Donner (in German, "thunder"), and Blixem was later changed to Bliksem, then Blitzen (German for "lightning"). Some consider Rudolph as part of the group as well, though he was not part of the original named work referenced previously. Rudolph was added by Robert L. May in 1939 as "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]".

According to the British comedy panel game [[QI]], Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and all of Santa's other reindeer must be either [[female]] or [[castration|castrated]], because [[male]] reindeer lose their antlers during winter.

Heraldry and symbols

<text>

[[Image:Beaumont hamel newfoundland memorial.jpg|thumb|left|The Caribou Monument at the [[World War I]] [[Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial]]]]

Several Norwegian municipalities have one or more reindeer depicted in their coats-of-arms: [[Eidfjord]], [[Porsanger]], [[Rendalen]], [[Tromsø]], [[Vadsø]], and [[Vågå]]. The historic province of [[Västerbotten]] in [[Sweden]] has a reindeer in its coat of arms. The present [[Västerbotten County]] has very different borders and uses the reindeer combined with other symbols in its coat-of-arms. The city of [[Piteå]] also has a reindeer. The logo for [[Umeå University]] features three reindeer.

The Canadian 25-cent coin, or "[[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarter]]" features a depiction of a caribou on one face. The caribou is the official provincial animal of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada, and appears on the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]]. A caribou statue was erected at the center of the [[Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial]], marking the spot in France where hundreds of soldiers from Newfoundland were killed and wounded in the [[World War I|First World War]] and there is a replica in [[Bowring Park]], in St. John's, Newfoundland's capital city.

Two municipalities in Finland have reindeer motifs in their coats-of-arms: [[Kuusamo]]<ref>[http://www.kunnat.net/k_perussivu.asp?path=1;29;341;486;84531;84544 Coat of arms for Kuusamo.]</ref> has a running reindeer and [[Inari, Finland|Inari]]<ref>[http://www.kunnat.net/k_perussivu.asp?path=1;29;102942;486;84531;84542 Coat of arms for Inari.]</ref> a fish with reindeer antlers.
