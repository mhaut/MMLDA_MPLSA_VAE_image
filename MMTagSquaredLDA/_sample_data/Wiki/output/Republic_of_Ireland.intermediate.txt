{{Main|Names of the Irish state}}
The official name of the country is ''Ireland'' for documents written in English and ''Éire'' for documents written in Irish. EU institutions follow the same practice, as the names of [[Member States of the European Union|EU member states]] must be written and abbreviated according to the ''Interinstitutional Style Guide'', and neither "Republic of Ireland" nor "Irish Republic" should be used when referring to the country.<ref>[http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370100.htm European Union Interinstitutional Style Guide.]</ref><ref>''Constitutional Law of 15 EU Member States'' (edition 6), L. Prakke, C. A. J. M. Kortmann, Hans van den Brandhof, J. C. E. van den Brandhof, Kluwer, 2004, ISBN 9013012558, Pg.430</ref> Since Irish became an [[official language]] of the Union in 2007, name plates for the state at EU meetings read as ''Éire – Ireland'', as used on [[Irish passport]]s.<ref group="note">Ireland joined the EU (then [[European Economic Community|EEC]]) in 1973 under a treaty drawn up in several languages including Irish and English. Since then, its two names have been used in the EU. For further consideration of the practice applied by the European Union, see [http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-000100.htm Clause 7.2.4 of the Inter Institutional Style Guide] of the European Union.</ref> Article 4 of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland states that "The name of the State is ''Éire'', or, in the English language, ''Ireland''." The wording of this article has been criticised in a report by the [[Constitution Review Group]] in 1996, stating that the wording was "unnecessarily complicated and that it should be simplified". An amendment was recommended to state that, "The name of the state is Ireland", with an equivalent change in the Irish text. The Constitution Review Group also considered whether the article should be amended to include "Republic of" in the name. It is satisfied that the legislative provision declaring the state's description to be the "Republic of Ireland" is sufficient.<ref>{{cite|title=Report of the Constitution Review Group|author=The Constitution Review Group|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|year=1996|url=http://www.constitution.ie/reports/crg.pdf}}</ref>

The [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] described the state as the "Republic of Ireland" (''Poblacht na hÉireann''),<ref name=description /> and declared Ireland a republic by transferring the last official functions of the [[British monarch]] to an elected president. No change of name took place as a result of that act, nor could it, as the name of the state is enshrined in the Constitution, and would require a referendum to change. In 1989 the Irish Supreme Court rejected an extradition warrant that used the name ''Republic of Ireland''. Justice Walsh ruled that, "if the courts of other countries seeking the assistance of this country are unwilling to give this State its constitutionally correct and internationally recognised name, then in my view, the warrants should be returned to such countries until they have been rectified."<ref>Casey, James, ''Constitutional Law in Ireland'', ISBN 978-1-899738-63-2, p. 31, in reference to the ''Ellis v O'Dea'' extradition case.</ref>

The [[island of Ireland]] was unilaterally [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed]] an independent republic by [[rebels]] in 1916 and called the ''[[Irish Republic]]'' (''Poblacht na hÉireann''). Following the [[1918 general election]], that [[Irish Declaration of Independence|proclamation was ratified]] by the [[First Dáil]]. Between 1921 and 1922, the British government legislated to establish Ireland as an autonomous region of the United Kingdom, creating ''[[Southern Ireland]]'' (and Northern Ireland). Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the state was established as an independent dominion in the [[British Commonwealth]], styled the ''[[Irish Free State]]'' (''Saorstát Éireann''). All of these names are still sometimes used unofficially. Other colloquial names, such ''the twenty-six counties'' and ''the South'' are also often used, particularly among residents of Northern Ireland. Likewise, from the perspective of the Republic of Ireland, [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland is often called]] ''the six counties'' or ''the North''.

From the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] on 1 January 1801 until 6 December 1922, all of Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]], from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. One million Irish died of starvation and/or disease and another 1.5 million emigrated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mokyr|first = Joel|authorlink = Joel Mokyr|title = New Developments in Irish Population History 1700–1850|journal = Irish Economic and Social History|volume = xi|pages = 101–121|year= 1984}}</ref> This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in a constant decline up to the 1960s.

From 1874, particularly under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] moved to prominence through widespread agrarian agitation, via the [[Irish Land League]], that won improved tenant [[land reforms]] in the form of the [[Irish Land Acts]], and with its attempts to achieve [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]], via two unsuccessful Bills which would have granted Ireland limited national autonomy. These led to the “grass-roots” control of national affairs under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|Local Government Act 1898]] previously in the hands of landlord-dominated [[grand juries]] of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

Home Rule seemed certain when the [[Parliament Act 1911]] abolished the veto of the [[House of Lords]], and [[John Redmond]] secured the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]. However, the [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist movement]] had been growing since 1886 among Irish Protestants after the introduction of the first home rule bill, fearing discrimination and loss of economic and social privileges if [[Rome Rule|Irish Catholics]] achieved real political power. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of [[Ulster]], where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. It was feared that any tariff barriers would heavily affect that region. In addition, the Protestant population was more prominent in Ulster, with a majority in four counties. Under the leadership of the Dublin-born [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] of the [[Irish Unionist Party]] and the northerner [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Sir James Craig]] of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], unionists became [[Ulster Volunteers|strongly militant]] in order to oppose ''the Coercion of Ulster''. After the Home Rule Bill passed parliament in May 1914, to avoid rebellion with Ulster, the British Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] introduced an [[Irish Parliamentary Party#Home Rule succeeds|Amending Bill]] reluctantly conceded to by the Irish Party leadership. This provided for the temporary exclusion of Ulster from the workings of the bill for a trial period of six years, with an as yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area to be temporarily excluded.

Though it received the [[Royal Assent]] and was placed on the statute books in 1914, the implementation of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Act]] was suspended until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. For the prior reasons of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war, Redmond and his Irish [[National Volunteers]] supported the [[Allies of World War I|Allied cause]], and 175,000 joined [[Irish regiment]]s of the [[10th (Irish) Division (United Kingdom)|10th (Irish)]], [[16th (Irish) Division (United Kingdom)|16th (Irish)]], while Unionists joined the [[36th (Ulster) Division|36th (Ulster)]] divisions of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]].<ref>[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=2517 Department of the Taoiseach] – Irish Soldiers in the First World War</ref> In January 1919, after the December [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]], 73 of Ireland's 106 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] elected were [[History of Sinn Féin|Sinn Féin]] members who refused to take their seats in the [[British House of Commons]]. Instead, they set up an Irish parliament called [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Dáil Éireann]]. [[First Dáil|This Dáil]] in January 1919 issued a [[Declaration of independence|Declaration of Independence]] and proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]]. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|1916 Proclamation]] with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the United Kingdom. The new Irish Republic was recognised internationally only by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Desmond|last=Fennell|title=Heresy: the Battle of Ideas in Modern Ireland|publisher=Blackstaff Press|location= Belfast|year=1993|isbn=0856405132|page=33|quote=Both the new Irish Republic and the labour movement were sympathetic to the new soviet regime in Russia. The government of the Soviet Union recognised the Republic, and the Dáil authorised the establishment of diplomatic relations.}}</ref> The Republic's [[Aireacht]] (ministry) sent a delegation under [[Ceann Comhairle]] [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, but it was not admitted.
[[File:Dáil Chamber.jpg|thumb|left|With the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, a new parliament called the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]] was established, of which [[Dáil Éireann]] became the [[lower house]].]]
After the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] and truce called in July 1921, representatives of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] and the Irish treaty delegates, led by [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Robert Barton]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London from 11 October to 6 December 1921. The Irish delegates set up headquarters at [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]] and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken on 5 December to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann.
The Second [[Second Dáil|Dáil Éireann]] [[Anglo-Irish Treaty Dáil vote|narrowly ratified]] the Treaty.

In accordance with the Treaty, on 6 December 1922 the entire [[island of Ireland]] became a self-governing British dominion called the [[Irish Free State]] (''Saorstát Éireann''). Under the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] had the option to leave the Irish Free State exactly one month later and return to the United Kingdom. During the intervening period, the powers of the [[Parliament of the Irish Free State]] and [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] did not extend to [[Northern Ireland]]. Northern Ireland exercised its right under the Treaty to ''opt out'' of the new dominion and rejoined the United Kingdom on 8 December 1922. It did so by making an Address to the King requesting, "that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland."<ref name="ahds1922">{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report, 7&nbsp;December 1922 |publisher=Stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk |date=7 December 1922 |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> However, the Irish Free State was a [[constitutional monarchy]] over which the British monarch reigned. It had a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament, a cabinet called the "Executive Council" and a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]].

Irish Civil War
</heading>
<text>

[[File:Éamon de Valera.jpg|upright|thumb|upright|right|[[Éamon de Valera]]]]
The [[Irish Civil War]] was the consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by [[Éamon de Valera]], objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty ''abolished'' the [[Irish Republic]] of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the "people have no right to do wrong". They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the British Commonwealth and that members of the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Free State Parliament]] would have to swear, what the Anti-Treaty side saw as, an oath of fidelity to the British King. Pro-Treaty forces, led by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], argued that the Treaty gave "not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it".

At the start of the war, the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|anti-treaty IRA]]. The pro-Treaty IRA disbanded and joined the new [[Irish Army]]. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty IRA, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, Michael Collins and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army with many tens of thousands of WWI veterans from the 1922 disbanded [[Irish regiments#Irish regiments of the British Army|Irish regiment]]s of the British Army, capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty forces (often called the ''Irregulars'') and the determination of the government to overcome the Irregulars contributed significantly to their defeat.

In the Northern Ireland question, Irish governments started to seek a peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the British government in the violent conflict involving many [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and the [[British Army]] in Northern Ireland known as "[[The Troubles]]". A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the [[Belfast Agreement]], was approved in 1998 in referendums north and south of the border. As part of the peace settlement, Ireland dropped its [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|territorial claim to Northern Ireland]].

1937 Constitution
</heading>
<text>

On 29 December 1937, the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (''Bunreacht na hÉireann'') came into force, which replaced the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] and called the state ''Ireland'', or ''Éire'' in Irish.<ref name="1937rename"/> The former Irish Free State government had taken steps to formally abolish the Office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] some months before the new Constitution came into force.<ref>and the Governor-General's office was finally abolished under the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937 with effect from December 1936</ref> Although the Constitution established the office of [[President of Ireland]], between 1937 and 1949 Ireland was not technically a republic. This was because the principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of symbolically representing Ireland internationally remained vested under ''statutory law'', in the British king as an ''organ'' of the Irish government. The [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|King's title in the Irish Free State]] was exactly the same as it was elsewhere in the British Empire:

*1922–1927 – ''By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''.
*1927–1937 – ''By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''.

[[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland remained neutral]] during World War II, a period it described as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]. The position of King ceased with the passage of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], which came into force on 18 April 1949 when the office of President of Ireland replaced that of the King. The Act declared that the state could be described as a republic. Later, the Crown of Ireland Act was formally repealed in Ireland by the Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act, 1962. Ireland was technically a member of the British Commonwealth after independence until the declaration of a republic on 18 April 1949. At the time, a declaration of a republic terminated Commonwealth membership. This rule was changed 10 days after Ireland declared itself a republic, with the [[London Declaration]] of 28 April 1949. Ireland immediately ceased membership and did not reapply when the rules were altered to permit republics to join.

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|right|In 1973, Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] along with the United Kingdom and Denmark. The country signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]
Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955, after previously being denied membership due to its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral stance]] during the Second World War and not supporting the [[Allies of World War II|Allied cause]].<ref>{{cite web|author=November getaways |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/review-ireland-at-the-un-memories-of-the-early-years-by-noel-dorr-2307174.html |title=Ireland at the UN |publisher=Independent.ie |date=22 August 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> At the time, joining the UN involved a commitment to using force to deter aggression by one state against another if the UN thought it was necessary.<ref>{{cite web|author=November getaways |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/a-frank-account-of-irelands-un-affairs-2235851.html |title=Ireland's UN affairs |publisher=Independent.ie |date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>

Interest towards membership of the [[European Economic Community]] developed in Ireland during the 1950s, with consideration also given to membership of the [[European Free Trade Area]]. As the United Kingdom intended on EEC membership, Ireland formally applied for membership in July 1961 due to the substantial economic linkages with the United Kingdom. However, the founding EEC members remained skeptical regarding Ireland's economic capacity, neutrality, and unattractive [[protectionist]] policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/EU/eu.htm |title=National Archives – Ireland and European Unity |publisher=Nationalarchives.ie |date= |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> Many Irish economists and politicians realised that economic policy reform was necessary. The prospect of EEC membership became doubtful in 1963 when French President General [[Charles de Gaulle]] stated that France opposed Britain's accession, which ceased negotiations with all other candidate countries. However, in 1969 his successor, [[George Pompidou]], was not opposed to British and Irish membership. Negotiations began and in 1972 the [[Treaty of Accession]] was signed. A referendum held in 1972 confirmed Ireland’s entry, and finally succeeded in joining the EEC in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/index1_en.htm |title=Joining the European Community |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=31 July 1961 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>

The economic crisis of the late 1970s was fueled by [[Fianna Fáil]]'s budget, the abolition of the car tax, excessive borrowing, and global economic instability. From 1989, there were significant policy changes with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending. This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/[[Progressive Democrats|Progressive Democrat]] government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] government and [[Fine Gael]]/Labour/Democratic Left government. Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, which lasted until the global [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].

{{Main|Geography of Ireland}}
[[File:Glendalough Valley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glendalough]] valley in [[County Wicklow]].]]
The island of Ireland extends over an area of {{convert|84421|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, of which about five-sixths belongs to the Republic of Ireland ({{convert|70280|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}) and the remainder constitutes [[Northern Ireland]]. It is bounded to the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the northeast by the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]. To the east coast is the [[Irish Sea]], which reconnects to the ocean via the southwest with [[St George's Channel]] and the [[Celtic Sea]]. The west coast is more rugged than that of the east, with many islands, [[peninsulas]], [[headlands and bays]].

The western landscape mostly consists of cliffs, hills and mountains. The highest point is [[Carrauntoohil]] ({{convert|1038|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}), located in the [[Macgillycuddy's Reeks]] mountain range. The country's interior is relatively flat, traversed by rivers such as the [[River Shannon]] and numerous lakes or ''loughs''. The large central lowlands consist of [[limestone]] covered with glacial deposits of [[clay]] and [[sand]]. The River Shannon watershed contains large areas of [[bogland]] used for [[peat]] extraction and production. Ireland also has some small off-shore deposits of oil and gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=oil+and+gas+fields+in+ireland&ie=UTF8&ll=53.592505,-9.030762&spn=6.274516,19.775391&z=6 |title=oil and gas fields in ireland – Google Maps |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> The main urban areas include Dublin in the east, Cork in the south, Limerick in the mid-west, Galway in the west, and Waterford in the southeast.

[[File:Torc Waterfall at Killarney National Park2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Killarney National Park]] has Ireland's most extensive covering of [[Old growth forest|native forest]].]]

Due to a lack of top predators, animal populations that cannot be controlled by smaller predators are controlled by annual [[culling]]. Large numbers of fields for crop [[cultivation]] and cattle rearing limits the establishment of native wild species. However, [[hedgerows]], which are traditionally used for maintaining and marking land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. Their [[ecosystem]]s stretch across the countryside, acting as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island.

[[File:Mary McAleese.jpg|thumb|upright|right|President [[Mary McAleese]]]]
Ireland is a [[constitutional republic]] with a parliamentary system of government. The {{lang|ga|[[Oireachtas]]}} is a [[bicameral]] parliament comprising of the [[President of Ireland]], {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]}} as the upper house, and {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann]]}} as the lower house.<ref>Article 15.2 of the Constitution of Ireland.</ref> The President serves as the [[head of state]], and is elected for a seven-year term and may be re-elected only once. President [[Mary McAleese]] is currently serving a second term after taking office in November 1997. The [[Irish presidential election, 2011|next presidential election]] is scheduled for October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0904/1224278192454.html|title=Irish Times - What you'll need to be the next president |accessdate=2011-01-04}}</ref> The President is primarily a [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]], but is entrusted with certain constitutional powers with the advice of the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]. The President has absolute discretion in some areas, such as referring a bill to the Supreme Court for a judgement on its constitutionality or refusing to dissolve the {{lang|ga|Dáil}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=15&lang=eng |title=Office of the President - Powers and Functions |accessdate=2011-01-04}}</ref> Once the {{lang|ga|Dáil}} elects the [[head of government]], the President appoints that person as the {{lang|ga|[[Taoiseach]]}} (prime minister). Most ''{{lang|ga|Taoisigh}}'' have served as the leader of the political party that gains the most seats in national elections. It has become customary for [[coalition]]s to form a government, as there has not been a single-party government since 1989.
[[File:Government Buildings, Dublin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Government Buildings]]]]
[[File:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leinster House]]]]
The {{lang|ga|Seanad}} is composed of sixty members, with eleven nominated by the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. The {{lang|ga|Dáil}} has 166 members ({{lang|ga|''[[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]]''}}) elected to represent multi-seat [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|constituencies]] under the system of [[proportional representation]] and by means of the [[single transferable vote]]. Under the Constitution of Ireland, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current statutory maximum term is five years. [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] is the [[official residence]] of the President of Ireland, while both houses of the Oireachtas meet at [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]].

The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members can be selected from the {{lang|ga|Seanad}}, and the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, {{lang|ga|[[Tánaiste]]}} (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance must be members of the {{lang|ga|Dáil}}. The current government is a minority administration led by {{lang|ga|[[Fianna Fáil]]}} with [[Brian Cowen]] as {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, supported by [[Independent (politician)|independents]]; the government's former main [[coalition government|coalition]] partner, the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] under leader [[John Gormley]], withdrew from government in January 2010, precipitating early elections. As well as the Greens, other opposition parties in the current {{lang|ga|Dáil}} are [[Fine Gael]] under [[Enda Kenny]], the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] under [[Eamon Gilmore]], and [[Sinn Féin]] led by [[Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin]].

The next general election must, therefore, take place no later than 14 July 2012.<ref>Article 16.5 of the constitution states that the Dáil may sit for a period of up to seven years from its first meeting.

Ireland has been a member of the European Union since 1973, but has chosen to remain outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Citizens of the United Kingdom can freely enter the country without a passport due to the [[Common Travel Area]], which is a passport-free zone comprising of the islands of Ireland, Great Britain, the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]].

{{See also|Counties of Ireland|Local government in the Republic of Ireland}}
Although Ireland has twenty-six traditional [[county|counties]], they are not always coterminous with administrative divisions. [[County Tipperary]] was divided into two in the 1890s while [[County Dublin]] was divided into three in the 1990s. This gives a present-day total of twenty-nine administrative counties, with the five cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]], and [[Waterford]] administered separately. The five [[borough]]s of [[Clonmel]], [[Drogheda]], [[Kilkenny]], [[Sligo]], and [[Wexford]] have a certain level of autonomy within their counties.<ref>{{cite book|last=Callanan|first=Mark |coauthors=Justin F.

The [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|Local Government Act 1898]] is the founding document of the present system of local government. Local authorities are responsible for matters such as planning, local roads, sanitation, and libraries. The [[Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Twentieth Amendment]] of 1999 provided for constitutional recognition of local government. The [[Local Government Act 2001]] established a two-tier structure, with the top tier consisting of 29 [[county council]]s and five [[city council]]s. Twenty-four of the 26 traditional counties have had county councils since 1898. County Tipperary has had two ([[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]]), and since 1994 the traditional County Dublin has had three ([[Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown]], [[Fingal]], and [[South Dublin]]). The five cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Galway have city councils, which have the same status as county councils. The second tier consists of [[Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland|town council]]s. The city of Kilkenny and four towns which had borough corporation status before 2001 (Sligo, Drogheda, Clonmel, and Wexford), are allowed to use the title of "Borough Council" instead of "Town Council", but have no additional responsibilities. There are 75 town councils in addition to these five borough councils. Outside the towns, the county councils are solely responsible for local services.

[[File:CriminalCourtofJusticeDublin.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Criminal Court of Justice (Dublin)|Criminal Court of Justice]] is the principal building for criminal courts.]]
Ireland has a [[common law]] [[legal system]] with a written constitution that provides for a [[parliamentary democracy]]. The court system consist of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], the [[Court of Criminal Appeal (Ireland)|Court of Criminal Appeal]], the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]], the [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Circuit Court]] and the [[District Court (Ireland)|District Court]], all of which apply the [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|law of Ireland]]. Trials for serious offences must usually be held before a [[jury]]. The High Court and the Supreme Court have authority, by means of [[judicial review]], to determine the compatibility of laws and activities of other institutions of the state with the constitution and the law. Except in exceptional circumstances, court hearings must occur in public. The [[Criminal Court of Justice (Dublin)|Criminal Court of Justice]] is the principal building for the criminal courts.<ref name="it-first-case-new-courts">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1124/1224259339011.html First case set for new criminal courts], Carol Coulter, [[The Irish Times]], 24 November 2009</ref><ref name="independent-pantheon">[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/new-order-in-court-as-8364140m-legal-pantheon-opens-doors-1951951.html New order in court as €140m legal 'Pantheon' opens doors], Dearbhail McDonald, [[Irish Independent]], 24 November 2009</ref> It includes the [[District Court (Ireland)|District Court]] [[Court of Criminal Appeal (Ireland)|Court of Criminal Appeal]], Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and [[High Court (Ireland)|Central Criminal Court]].<ref name="it-first-case-new-courts"/>

The state's civilian police force, [[Garda Síochána|Garda Síochána na hÉireann]] (''Guardians of the Peace of Ireland''), is responsible for all aspects of civil policing, both in terms of territory and infrastructure. It is headed by the Garda Commissioner, who is appointed by the Government. Most uniformed members do not routinely carry [[firearms]]. Standard policing is traditionally carried out by uniformed officers equipped only with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]].

The [[Póilíní Airm]] (''Military Police'') is the corps of the [[Irish Army]] responsible for the provision of policing service personnel and providing a military police presence to forces while on exercise and deployment. In wartime, additional tasks include the provision of a traffic control organisation to allow rapid movement of military formations to their mission areas. Other wartime roles include control of [[prisoners of war]] and refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rdf.ie/corps/military-police.html |title=The Defence Forces |publisher=Rdf.ie |date= |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> 

Ireland's [[Irish nationality law|citizenship laws]] relate to "the island of Ireland" (incl. islands and seas), thereby extending them to [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the United Kingdom. Therefore, anyone born in Northern Ireland who meets the requirements for being an Irish citizen, such as birth on the island of Ireland to an Irish or British citizen parent or a parent who is entitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Republic without restriction on their residency,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent |title=Irish citizenship through birth or descent |publisher=Citizensinformation.ie |date= |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> may exercise an entitlement to Irish citizenship, such as an Irish passport.<ref>[http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/ConsolidationINCA.pdf/Files/ConsolidationINCA.pdf Irish Nationality & Citizenship Acts 1956–2004 (unofficial consolidated version) – [[pdf]] format]</ref>

Ireland tends towards independence in foreign policy, thus the country is not a member of [[NATO]] and has a [[The Emergency (Ireland)#Neutrality|longstanding]] <!-- constitutional? --> policy of military neutrality. This policy has helped the [[Irish Defence Forces]] to be successful in their contributions to peace-keeping missions with the United Nations since 1960, during the [[Congo Crisis]] and subsequently in Cyprus, Lebanon and Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.military.ie/overseas/index.htm|title=Ireland and the United Nations|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>

The Irish Air Corps is the air component of the Defence Forces and operates sixteen fixed wing aircraft and eight helicopters. The Irish Naval Service is Ireland's Navy, and operates eight [[patrol ship]]s, and smaller numbers of inflatable boats and training vessels, and has highly trained armed boarding parties capable of seizing a ship and a special unit of [[frogman|frogmen]]. Although the Naval Service has no heavy warships, all Irish vessels have significant firepower. The military includes the Reserve Defence Forces ([[Irish Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] and [[Naval Service Reserve]]) for non-active reservists.

Ireland is ranked as the world's seventh most "economically free" economy according to the [[Index of Economic Freedom]]. In terms of [[GDP]] per capita, Ireland is  one of the wealthiest countries in the [[OECD]] and the EU. However, Ireland ranks below the OECD average in terms of [[GNP]] per capita, despite significant growth in recent years. GDP is significantly greater than GNP due to the large amount of multinational firms based in Ireland.<ref name="2009forfasACR">{{cite web

Ireland's economy has been significantly affected by the global [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. A dramatic rise in consumer spending, construction and business investment led to rapid economic growth between 1995 and 2007, which became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] period. A major [[Irish property bubble|property bubble]] developed overtime and eventually burst in 2008. The fall in domestic and commercial property prices has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, and has contributed to the ongoing [[Irish banking crisis]]. Ireland was the first country in the EU to officially enter a [[recession]], as declared by the [[Central Statistics Office|CSO]], as the economy contracted by 1.7% in 2008 and 7.1% in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie |title=CSO – Central Statistics Office Ireland |publisher=Central Statistics Office Ireland |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> The country officially exited recession in 2010 following growth of 0.3% in Q4 of 2009 and 2.7% in Q1 of 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ireland-out-of-recession-as-exports-jump-2015128.html |title=Ireland out of recession as exports jump |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=113356 |title=Ireland out of recession but needs faster growth |work=BusinessDay |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> However, the Irish economy experienced a Q2 contraction of 1.2% and remains quite fragile.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11397875 | work=BBC News | title=Irish economy contracts by 1.2% | date=23 September 2010}}</ref> In November 2010, Ireland accepted an €85 billion programme for assistance from the EU and [[IMF]], including bilateral loans from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/1128/breaking1.html Ireland to receive €85 billion bailout at 5.8% interest rate]</ref>

Railway services are provided by [[Iarnród Éireann]]. Dublin is the centre of the network with two main stations, [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston station]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly station]], linking to the country's main towns and cities. The [[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]] service, which runs jointly with [[Northern Ireland Railways]], connects Dublin and [[Belfast]]. Dublin has a steadily improving public transport network including the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]], [[Luas]], [[Dublin Bus]], and [[dublinbikes]].

The road network is primarily focused on Dublin. Motorways are currently being extended to other cities as part of the [[Transport 21]] programme, which is a capital investment framework through which Ireland's transport system will be developed over the period 2006 to 2015.<ref>[http://www.transport21.ie/What_Is_Transport_21/Transport_21/What_is_Transport_21.html Transport 21 Website – What is Transport 21?]</ref> Dublin has been the focus of major projects such as the [[East-Link (Dublin)|East-Link]] and [[West-Link]] toll-bridges, as well as the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]]. The [[Jack Lynch Tunnel]], under the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]] in Cork, and the [[Limerick Tunnel]], under the [[River Shannon]], were two major projects outside Dublin. Several by-pass projects are underway at other cities and towns.  The [[Motorways in the Republic of Ireland|motorways]], along with [[national primary road]]s and [[national secondary road]]s, are managed by the [[National Roads Authority]]. [[Regional road]]s and [[Local Roads in Ireland|local roads]] are managed by the local authorities in each of their respective areas. Regular ferry services operate between Ireland and Britain, the [[Isle of Man]] and France.

[[File:IrelandPopulationChange.png|thumb|right|Population of Ireland from 1936 to 2006.]]
Genetic research suggests that the first settlers of Ireland came through migrations from [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] following the end of the most recent [[ice age]].<ref>[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7817 Myths of British ancestry]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} – Prospect Magazine</ref> After the [[Mesolithic]], the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]], migrants introduced [[Celt]]ic culture and languages.

Today, Irish people are mainly of Gaelic ancestry, and some of Norse, Anglo-Norman, English, Scottish, French and Welsh ancestry. Gaelic culture forms an important part of national identity.

The [[Minister for Health and Children (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]] has responsibility for setting overall policy with regard to the health service. Every individual resident in Ireland is entitled to receive health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the [[Health Service Executive]] and funded by general taxation. It was established in 2004 and came into operation at the start of 2005. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are provided free of charge and children up to the age of 6 months . Emergency care is provided at a cost of €100 for a visit to the Accident and Emergency department.

Anyone holding a [[European Health Insurance Card]] is entitled to free maintenance and treatment in public beds in Health Service Executive and voluntary hospitals. Outpatient services are also provided for free. However the majority of patients on median incomes or above are required to pay subsidised hospital charges. Private health insurance is available to the population for those who want to avail of it. [[Vhi Healthcare]] (government owned), [[Quinn Healthcare]], and [[Aviva Group Ireland|Aviva]] provide health insurance, among other services.

The average [[life expectancy]] in Ireland is 79.2 years, with 76.8 years for men and 81.6 years for women.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0210/1224264112502.html Women beat men on life expectancy, education - CSO]</ref> It has the highest birth rate in the EU (16.8 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to an EU average of 10.7)<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0727/breaking38.html Ireland has EU's highest birth rate]</ref> and a very low infant mortality rate (3.5 per 1,000 [[live births]]).

{{Main|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
Ireland has three levels of education: primary, secondary and higher education. The education systems are largely under the direction of the Government via the [[Minister for Education and Science (Ireland)|Minister for Education and Science]]. Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by the relevant authorities. Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fifteen years, and all children up to the age of eighteen must complete the first three years of secondary, including one sitting of the [[Junior Certificate]] examination.<ref>Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 [http://193.178.1.79/ZZA22Y2000S17.html (Section 17)]</ref>  

[[File:Uccquadrangle.jpg|thumb|left|[[University College Cork]]]]

The [[Leaving Certificate]], which is taken after two years of study, is the final examination in the secondary school system.

{{Main|Languages of Ireland|Irish language|Hiberno-English|Mid Ulster English}}

Irish is the "national language" according to the Constitution, but English is the dominant language. In the 2006 census, 39% of the population regarded themselves as competent in Irish. Fluent Irish-speakers are limited to low tens of thousands in isolated western areas and [[Gaeltacht]] regions. Apart from in Gaeltacht regions, road signs are usually bilingual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/si/0164.html |title=S.I. No. 164/1970: ROAD TRAFFIC (SIGNS) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1970. |publisher=Irish Statute Book |date=16 July 1970 |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> The legal status of place names has been controversial, with an order made in 2005 under the [[Official Languages Act 2003|Official Languages Act]] changing the official name of certain locations from English back to Irish. [[Dingle]] had its name changed to ''An Daingean'', despite local opposition and a local plebiscite requesting that the name be changed to a bilingual version: ''Dingle Daingean Uí Chúis''. Most public notices and print media are in English only. Most Government publications are available in both languages, and citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish. Media in Irish exist on TV ([[TG4]]), radio (e.g. [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]]) and print (e.g. [[Foinse]]). In the [[Irish Defence Forces]], all foot and arms drill commands are given in the Irish language.

As a result of immigration, Polish is one of the most widely spoken languages in Ireland after English and Irish. Several other Central and Eastern European languages are also spoken on a day-to-day basis. Other languages spoken in Ireland include [[Shelta]], spoken by Irish Travellers, and a dialect of [[Ulster Scots language|Scots]] is spoken by some descendants of [[Ulster-Scots|Scottish settlers]] in Ulster. Most secondary school students choose to learn one or two foreign languages. Languages available for the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate include French, German, Italian and Spanish; Leaving Certificate students can also study Arabic, Japanese and Russian. Some secondary schools also offer [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Latin]]. The study of Irish is compulsory for Leaving Certificate students, but some may qualify for an exemption in some circumstance, such as learning difficulties or entering the country after age 11.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.education.ie/robots/view.jsp?pcategory=17216&language=EN&ecategory=42741&link=link001&doc=38941 |title=Pupils exempt from the study of the Irish language (per ''Circular M10/94 – Revision of Rule 46 of the "Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools" in relation to exemption from Irish'' |publisher=Department of Education and Skills |accessdate=27 October 2010 }}</ref>

[[File:CorkStFinbarrsCathedral.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Saint Finbarre's Cathedral]]]]
Religious freedom is constitutionally provided for in Ireland. [[Christianity in Ireland|Christianity]] is the predominant religion, with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the largest church. In 2006, 86.8% of the population identified themselves as Roman Catholic, 4.8% as Protestant or another Christian religion, 4.2% as non-religious, 2% as non-Christian, and 1.6% did not state their religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf |title=Final Principal Demographic Results 2006 |format=PDF |year=2006 |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> According to a [[Georgetown University]] study, the country has one of the  highest rates of regular [[Roman Catholic Mass|Mass]] attendance in the Western World.<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/international.htm Weekly Mass Attendance of Catholics in Nations with Large Catholic Populations, 1980–2000]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} – World Values Survey (WVS)</ref>
While daily attendance was 13% in 2006, there was a reduction in weekly attendance from 81% in 1990 to 48% in 2006, although the decline was reported as levelling off.<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=44521 Irish Mass attendance below 50%] – Catholic World News 1 June 2006</ref> 

The [[Church of Ireland]] is the second largest Christian denomination. Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but has recently experienced an increase, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterian Church]] and [[Methodist Church in Ireland|Methodist Church]]. Immigration has contributed to a growth in [[Hinduism in Ireland|Hindu]] and Muslim populations, as well as the small Jewish community. In percentage terms, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively.<ref>{{cite book|title=Final Principal Demographic Results 2006|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2010|year=2007|publisher=Central Statistics Office |isbn=0-7557-7169-9|pages=31 (Table Q)}}</ref> 

Ireland's patron saints are [[Saint Patrick]], [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bridget]] and [[Columba|Saint Columba]]. Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. [[Saint Patrick's Day]] is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations. 

As with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifth Amendment]] in a referendum. Article 44 still remains in the Constitution: ''The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.'' The article also establishes freedom of religion, prohibits endowment of any religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

[[Religious studies]] was introduced as an optional Junior Certificate subject in 2001. Despite many schools being run by religious organisations, a secularist trend is occurring among younger generations.<ref>Among many examples:<br/>John Daniszewski, 17 April 2005, [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-ireland17apr17,0,5254747.story Catholicism Losing Ground in Ireland], LA Times<br/>[http://www.secularism.org.uk/irishpollshowsparentsnolongerwan.html Irish poll shows parents no longer want to force religion on to children] from secularism.org.uk<br/>Phil Lawler, 17 September 2007, [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=53564 Ireland threatened by secularism, Pope tells new envoy], Catholic World News</ref> Religious schools cannot discriminate against pupils concerning religion. A sanctioned system of preference does exist, where students of a particular religion may be accepted before those who do not share the ethos of the school, in a case where a school's quota has already been reached.

{{Main|Irish literature}}
[[File:Jonathan Swift by Charles Jervas detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jonathan Swift]] (1667-1745)]]
Ireland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages. Modern [[Irish fiction]] began with the publishing of the 1726 novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]]. Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include [[Laurence Sterne]] with the publication of ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' and [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''. Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including [[Maria Edgeworth]], [[John Banim]], [[Gerald Griffin]], [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], [[George A. Moore|George Moore]], and [[Somerville and Ross]]. [[Bram Stoker]] is best known as the author of the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''.

[[James Joyce]] (1882–1941) published his most famous work ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in 1922, which is an interpretation of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' set in Dublin. [[Edith Anna Somerville|Edith Somerville]] continued writing after the death of her partner [[Violet Florence Martin|Martin Ross]] in 1915. Dublin's [[Annie M. P. Smithson]] was one of several authors catering for fans of romantic fiction in the 1920s and 1930s. After the Second World War, popular novels were published by, among others, Brian O'Nolan, who published as [[Flann O'Brien]], [[Elizabeth Bowen]], and [[Kate O'Brien]]. During the final decades of the 20th century, [[Edna O'Brien]], [[John McGahern]], [[Maeve Binchy]], [[Joseph O'Connor]], [[Roddy Doyle]], [[Colm Tóibín]], and [[John Banville]] came to the fore as novelists.

[[File:Yeats1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[W. B. Yeats]] (1865-1939)]]

[[Patricia Lynch]] (1898-1972) was a prolific children's author, while [[Eoin Colfer]] has been particularly successful in this genre in recent years. In the genre of the short story, which is a form favoured by many Irish writers, the most prominent figures include [[Seán Ó Faoláin]], [[Frank O'Connor]] and [[William Trevor]]. Well known Irish poets include [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Thomas McCarthy (poet)|Thomas McCarthy]], [[Dermot Bolger]], and [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureates [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] (born in Northern Ireland but resides in Dublin). Prominent writers in the Irish language are [[Pádraic Ó Conaire]], [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]], [[Séamus Ó Grianna]], and [[Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill]]. 

The history of [[Irish theatre]] begins with the expansion of the English administration in Dublin during the early 17th century, and since then, Ireland has significantly contributed to English drama. In its early history, theatrical productions in Ireland tended to serve political purposes, but as more theatres opened and the popular audience grew, a more diverse range of entertainments were staged. Many Dublin-based theatres developed links with their London equivalents, and British productions frequently found their way to the Irish stage. However, most Irish playwrights went abroad to establish themselves. At the beginning of the 20th century, theatre companies dedicated to the staging of Irish plays and the development of writers, directors and performers began to emerge, which allowed many Irish playwrights to learn their trade and establish their reputations in Ireland rather than in Britain or the United States. Following in the tradition of Nobel Prize in Literature laureates George Bernard Shaw, [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Samuel Beckett]], playwrights such as [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Brendan Behan]], [[Conor McPherson]], and [[Billy Roche]] have gained popular success.<ref>{{cite book|last =Houston|first =Eugenie|title =Working and Living in Ireland|publisher =Working and Living Publications|year =2001|isbn=0-95368-968-9}}</ref>

{{Main|Irish music|Irish dance}}
[[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] has remained vibrant, despite globalising cultural forces, and retains many traditional aspects. It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock. Well known artists include [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Clannad]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Dubliners]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[Christy Moore]], [[Mary Black]], ensembles such as [[Anúna]] and [[Celtic Woman]], and cross-over artists such as [[Enya]] and [[Sinéad O'Connor]]. 

[[File:The Frames, cont.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Frames]]]]

Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues, including [[The Corrs]], [[The Cranberries]], [[The Pogues]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Boyzone]], [[Westlife]], [[U2]], [[Chris de Burgh]], [[Damien Rice]], guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]], and [[Academy Award]] winner [[Glen Hansard]] of [[The Frames]]. Contemporary artists include [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]], [[Fight Like Apes]], [[Jape (band)|Jape]], [[Lisa Hannigan]], [[Mick Flannery]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Republic of Loose]], [[The Blizzards]], [[The Coronas]], [[The Script]], [[Two Door Cinema Club]], [[Cathy Davey]], and [[Imelda May]].

There are a number of classical music ensembles around the country, such as the [[RTÉ Performing Groups]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.ie/links/index.html |title=Contemporary Music Ireland |publisher=Contemporary Music Centre – Links |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> Ireland also has three opera organisations. Opera Ireland produces large-scale operas in Dublin, the Opera Theatre Company tours its chamber-style operas throughout the country, and the annual [[Wexford Festival Opera|Wexford Opera Festival]], which promotes lesser-known operas, takes place during October and November.

Irish dance can broadly be divided into [[social dance]] and [[performance dance]]. Irish social dance can be divided into ''céilí''  and set dancing. Irish [[set dance]]s are [[quadrilles]], danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while [[Ceili dance|céilí dances]] are danced by varied [[Formation dance|formations]] of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as [[step dance|stepdance]]. [[Irish stepdance]], popularised by the show ''[[Riverdance]]'', is notable for its rapid leg movements, with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet. The solo dances can either be in "soft shoe" or "hard shoe".

[[Image:stout.jpg|thumb|right|A [[pint]] of [[stout]] and [[soda bread]].]]
Irish cuisine was traditionally based on meat and dairy, supplemented with vegetables and seafood. The [[potato]] eventually formed the basis of many traditional Irish dishes after its introduction in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandby.com/recipes/recipes.htm |title=Traditional Irish Cuisine |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> Examples of popular Irish cuisine include [[boxty]], [[colcannon]], [[coddle]], [[Irish stew|stew]], and [[bacon and cabbage]]. Ireland is famous for the [[Full breakfast|full Irish breakfast]], which involves a fried or grilled meal generally comprising of bacon, egg, sausage, pudding, and fried tomato. Apart from the significant influence by European and international dishes, there has been a recent emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. Shellfish have increased in popularity, especially due to the high quality shellfish available from the country's coastline. The most popular fish include [[salmon]] and [[cod]]. Traditional breads include [[soda bread]] and [[wheaten bread]]. [[Barmbrack]] is a [[yeast]]ed [[bread]] with added [[sultana (grape)|sultana]]s and [[raisin]]s.

Popular everyday beverages among the Irish include [[Irish breakfast tea|tea]] and [[Irish coffee|coffee]]. Alcoholic drinks associated with Ireland include [[Poitín]] and the world famous [[Guinness]], which is a [[dry stout]] that originated in the brewery of [[Arthur Guinness]] at [[St. James's Gate]] in Dublin. [[Irish whiskey]] is also popular throughout the country, and comes in various forms, including single malt, single grain and blended whiskey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandlogue.com/food-drink |title=Food & Drink in Ireland |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref>

The receding influence of the Catholic Church and the effects of immigration have led to Ireland becoming an increasingly [[Secularism|secularised]] society. Contraception was controlled in Ireland until 1979.<ref name="familyplanning">{{cite web|title = Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979|date=  23 July 1979|publisher = Office of the Attorney General|url = http://193.178.1.79:80/1979/en/act/pub/0020/index.html|accessdate = 7 June 2007}}</ref> In 1983, the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] recognised "the right to life of the unborn", subject to qualifications concerning the "equal right to life" of the mother. The case of ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' subsequently prompted passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fourteenth]] Amendments, guaranteeing the right to have an abortion performed abroad, and the right to learn about "services" that are illegal in Ireland but legal abroad. The prohibition on divorce in the 1937 Constitution was repealed in 1995 under the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifteenth Amendment]].

Discrimination based on age, gender, sexual orientation, maritial or familial status, religion, race or membership of the travelling community is illegal in Ireland.
