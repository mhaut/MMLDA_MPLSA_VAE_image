The men's tournament held at the 1920 Summer Olympics was organised by a committee that included future IIHF president [[Paul Loicq]]. The tournament used the Bergvall System, in which three rounds were played.<ref name="Num21">[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-21.html Story #21–Ice Hockey debuts at the Olympics].</ref> The first round was an elimination tournament that determined the gold medal winner. The second round consisted of the teams that were defeated by the gold medal winner; the winner of that round was awarded the silver medal. The final round was played between teams that had lost to the gold or silver medal winners; the winner of that round received the bronze medal.<ref name="Birth"/>

The tournament was played from April 23 to April 29 and seven teams participated: [[Canada at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], the [[United States at the 1920 Summer Olympics|United States]], [[Switzerland at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Switzerland]], [[Sweden at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Sweden]], [[France at the 1920 Summer Olympics|France]] and [[Belgium at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Belgium]]. Canada chose to send the [[Allan Cup]]-winning [[Winnipeg Falcons]]. The Americans began a tournament to determine their representative team but abandoned it, deciding instead to send an all-star team that included four Canadian-born players. The Swedish team consisted of mostly [[bandy]] players, many of whom had only started playing hockey in preparation for the tournament.<ref name="Birth" /> Canada won all three of the team's games in the first round and won the gold medal, defeating Sweden in the final and outscoring opponents 27–1.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1920 – Summer Olympics VII (Antwerp, Belgium)|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=9346|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> In the two subsequent rounds, the United States and Czechoslovakia won the silver and bronze medals respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title=United States is second at hockey; Victory Over Czechoslovak Team by 16 to 0 Gives Americans 3 Points in Olympics.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE4D81E3CEE3ABC4151DFB266838B639EDE|date=1920-04-29|accessdate=2009-03-01|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The Bergvall System was criticised, especially in Sweden, because the Swedish team had to play six games (winning three) while the bronze medal winning Czech team only had to play three (winning one). [[Erik Bergvall]], the creator of the system, stated that it was used incorrectly and that a tournament of all of the losing teams from the first round should have been played for the silver medal.<ref name="Birth"/> Because of these criticisms, the Bergvall System was not used again for ice hockey.<ref name="Birth"/>

In [[Ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], the tournament was played in a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin format]], consisting of a preliminary round and a medal round. The medals were awarded based on win–loss records during the medal round.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1924 – Winter Olympics I (Chamonix, France)|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=10263|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> This format was used until [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], although the number of teams and games played varied slightly. The [[Toronto Granites]], representing Canada, became one of the dominant hockey teams in Olympic history, outscoring opponents 110–3, led by [[Harry Watson (ice hockey b. 1898)|Harry Watson]], who scored 36 goals.<ref>[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-53.html Story #53–Harry Watson scores at will in Olympics].</ref> The [[United States at the 1924 Winter Olympics|United States]] won silver and [[Great Britain at the 1924 Winter Olympics|Great Britain]] won bronze.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ice Hockey at the 1924 Chamonix Winter Games: Men's Ice Hockey|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1924/ICH/mens-ice-hockey.html|publisher=sports-reference.com|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> Watson's 36 goals remains the tournament record for career goals.

Two days before the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], Germany, Canadian officials protested that two players on the [[Great Britain at the 1936 Winter Olympics|British team]]—[[James Foster (ice hockey)|James Foster]] and [[Alex Archer]]—had played in Canada but transferred without permission to play for clubs in the [[English National League]]. The IIHF agreed with Canada, but Great Britain threatened to withdraw the team if the two were barred from competing. To avoid a conflict, Canada withdrew the protest shortly before the Games began. The tournament consisted of four groups and fifteen teams. Great Britain became the first non-Canadian team to win gold; Canada won silver and the [[United States at the 1936 Winter Olympics|United States]] bronze.<ref>[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-15.html Story #15–Great Britain wins Olympic gold].</ref> [[World War II]] forced the cancellation of the [[1940 Winter Olympics|1940]] and [[1944 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Olympic Review|issue=8|year=1940|month=January|title=The Fifth Olympic Winter Games Will Not Be Held|pages=pp. 8–10|editor=Diem, Carl|publisher=International Olympic Institute|location=Berlin|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1940/ORUE8/ORUE8c.pdf|format=PDF|type=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref>

During the run-up to the [[1948 Winter Olympics]] in St. Moritz, Switzerland, a conflict broke out between two American ice hockey bodies, the American Hockey Association (AHA) and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU). The AAU, which had run amateur hockey in the United States since 1930, was expelled by the IIHF in 1947 when it refused to support a team composed of players from the AHA. The AAU stated that the AHA players were "openly paid salaries"; at the time, the Olympics were strictly for amateur players.<ref name="Num82">[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-82.html Story #82–USA sends two teams to the 1948 Olympics].</ref> The Swiss Olympic Organizing Committee (SOOC) had accepted the AHA's application, but [[Avery Brundage]] of the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) threatened to withdraw the entire American team if the AHA participated in the Olympics. The IIHF countered by threatening to withdraw hockey from the Games if the AHA were banned. The IOC suggested that both American teams be banned but the SOOC rejected this proposal. The IOC decided to switch hockey to an unofficial event but relented when a compromise was reached. The AHA team was allowed to compete but would not be considered an official participant or allowed to win a medal. The AHA team finished fourth in the standings.<ref name="Num82"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ice Hockey at the 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games: Men's Ice Hockey|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/ICH/mens-ice-hockey.html|publisher=sports-reference.com|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref><ref name="Pod1948">{{harvnb|Podnieks|1997|pp=53–66}}</ref> Both [[Czechoslovakia at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Canada at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Canada]] won seven games and tied when they played each other.

At the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, the [[Soviet Union at the 1964 Winter Olympics|Soviet team]] won all seven of its games, earning the gold medal.

The Winter Olympics returned to Lake Placid, New York in [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980]]. Twelve teams participated in the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|tournament]], including [[Canada at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Canada]] for the first time since 1968. The [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered the tournament as heavy favourites and were considered natural rivals with the American team due to the [[Cold War]].<ref name="Num1"/> The Americans, coached by [[Herb Brooks]] and consisting mainly of college students, tied [[Sweden at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Sweden]] and scored an upset win over [[Czechoslovakia at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Czechoslovakia]] in the preliminary round. They finished with four wins and a tie and advanced to the medal round, which also consisted of Sweden, [[Finland at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Finland]] and the Soviet Union.<ref name="Num1">[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-1.html Story #1–Miracle on Ice].</ref>

The tournament became most famous for the "Miracle on Ice", the February 22 medal-round game between the Soviet Union and the United States that took place at the [[Herb Brooks Arena|Olympic Center]] (now known as the Herb Brooks Arena). The Soviets scored first, then took a 2–1 lead, but the Americans tied the game with one second left in the first period.<ref name="Judd110"/> In the second period, Soviet goaltender [[Vladislav Tretiak]] was replaced by [[Vladimir Myshkin]].<ref name="Num1"/> The Soviets regained the lead early in the second period but the Americans kept the game close thanks to the goaltending of [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]]. In the final period, the Americans tied the game and captain [[Mike Eruzione]] scored with exactly 10 minutes to play in the contest to give the Americans a 4–3 lead.<ref name="Judd110">{{harvnb|Judd|2008|pp=110–111}}</ref> Craig withstood another series of Soviet shots to finish the match with the win.

Yes!"<ref name="Num1"/><ref>{{cite news|title=The Golden Goal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/the_golden_goal/|work=Sports Illustrated|author=Swift, E.M.|date=1980-03-03|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

A common misconception is that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets.<ref>{{Cite web|title=College kids perform Olympic miracle|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html|publisher=ESPN|author=Allen, Kevin|accessdate=2009-03-02|date=1997-12-23}}</ref> However, the medals were awarded based on points accumulated against teams that made the medal round. The Americans did not win the gold until February 24, when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets defeated Sweden and won the silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the Miracle on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.<ref name="Num1"/>

Since 1976, 12 teams have participated in the men's tournament, except in 1998 and 2002, when the number was raised to 14. The number of teams has ranged from 4 (in 1932) to 16 (in 1964). After the NHL allowed its players to compete at the 1998 Winter Olympics, the "Big Six" teams (Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States) were given automatic qualification and [[Bye (sports)|bye]]s to the final round.<ref name="Num7"/> The number of teams was increased to 14 so that a preliminary round-robin tournament consisting of eight teams could be held. The top two teams from the preliminary round ([[Belarus at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Kazakhstan]]) joined the "Big Six" in the finals. A similar system was used in 2002.<ref name="Bench"/> For the following tournament, the number of teams was lowered to 12 so that all teams played fewer games.<ref name=SR06/> Qualification for the men's tournament at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] was structured around the [[2008 IIHF World Ranking]]. Twelve spots were made available for teams. The top nine teams in the World Ranking after the [[2008 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] received automatic berths. Teams ranked 10th through 30th had an opportunity to qualify for the event. Teams ranked 19th through 30th played in a first qualification round in November 2008. The top three teams from the round advanced to the second qualification round, joined by teams ranked 10th through 18th. The top three teams from this round advanced to the Olympic tournament.<ref name="MenProg"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=266366|title=Germany, Norway round out 2010 Olympic men's hockey|publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=2009-02-08|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>

The women's tournament uses a similar qualification format. The top six teams in the IIHF Women's World Ranking after the [[2008 Women's World Ice Hockey Championships]] received automatic berths. Teams ranked 13th and below were divided into two groups for a first qualification round in September 2008. The two group winners advanced to the second qualification round, where the teams ranked seventh through twelfth joined them.<ref name="WomProg">{{Cite web|title=Women's Tournament Program|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics/olympics-women/tournament-program.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>

*"Each player must be a citizen of the country he represents."

If a player who has never played in an IIHF competition changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country for at least two consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC).<ref name="Eligibility"/> If a player who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once.<ref name="Eligibility"/> The original IOC rules stated that an athlete that had already played for one nation could not later change nations under any circumstances.<ref name="Pod1920"/>

The [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team's full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the IIHF and IOC. [[Avery Brundage]], president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together.

In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow "open competition" between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics, because of the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid-season and the IOC's amateur-only policy.<ref>[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-6.html Story #6–First Canada Cup opens up the hockey world].</ref>

Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, a dispute formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted a rule that made any player who had signed an NHL contract but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, as long as they had not played in any NHL games.<ref name="Pod1984">{{harvnb|Podnieks|1997|pp=147–158}}</ref> This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the [[World Hockey Association]]—were allowed to play.<ref name="Pod1984"/> Canadian hockey official [[Alan Eagleson]] stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Eagleson upset over hockey dispute|work=The New York Times|author=Litsky, Frank|date=1984-01-25}}</ref> [[Murray Costello]] of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Canada considers hockey withdrawal|work=The New York Times|date=1984-02-05}}</ref> In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Players in NHL are now eligible in the Olympics|work=Toronto Star|author=Monsebraaten, Laurie|date=1986-10-15}}</ref> but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr01.htm|title=Amateurism|date=1999-07-12|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref>

The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994 because the Winter Olympics typically occur in February, during the league's regular season. To allow participation, the NHL would have been forced to take a break in its schedule.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aiding U.S. Olympic Team May Bring Gold to N.H.L., Too|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DA1639F935A35750C0A96E948260|author=[[Ken Dryden|Dryden, Ken]]|accessdate=2009-03-15|date=1988-03-06|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In 1992, [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) players participated in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

He hoped that NHL participation would "get exposure like the world has never seen for hockey".<ref name="Gamble"/> The typical NBA season is held in the winter and spring, so the Summer Olympics do not conflict with the regular season schedule.

The [[2004–05 NHL season]] was [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] and eventually [[2004–05 NHL lockout|cancelled]] because of a labour dispute between the league and its players.

Game rules

At the first tournament in 1920, there were many differences from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed,<ref name="Birth">{{cite journal|title=The Birth of Swedish Ice Hockey – Antwerp 1920|author=Hansen, Kenth|journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius|publisher=[[International Society of Olympic Historians]]|month=May|year=1996|volume=4|issue=2|pages=5–27|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv4n2/JOHv4n2c.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56&nbsp;m&nbsp;×&nbsp;18&nbsp;m (165&nbsp;ft&nbsp;×&nbsp;58.5&nbsp;ft)<ref name="Pod1920"/> and two 20-minute periods were played.<ref name="Num21"/> Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the [[Rover (ice hockey)|rover]].<ref name="Timeline" /> Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.<ref name="Birth" />
[[Image:Ice hockey layout.svg|300px|thumb|left|In 2010, games were played on an NHL-sized rink surface for the first time (''size comparison pictured'').]]
The tournaments follow the rules used by the IIHF. At the 1969 IIHF Congress, officials voted to allow [[Checking (ice hockey)|body-checking]] in all three zones in a [[Ice hockey rink|rink]] similar to the NHL. Before that, body-checking was only allowed in the [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] in international hockey.<ref name="Num19">[[#Podmon|Podnieks and Szemberg 2008]], [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-19.html Story #19–IIHF allows bodychecking in all three zones].</ref> Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear [[Hockey helmet|helmet]]s starting in 1970, and [[goaltender mask]]s became mandatory in 1972.<ref name="Timeline"/> In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a [[Penalty shootout|shootout]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stats.iihf.com/archive/Overtimes.pdf|title=All game-winning shot competitions ("shootouts")|accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 1998, the IIHF passed a rule that allowed two-line [[Pass (ice hockey)|passes]].
